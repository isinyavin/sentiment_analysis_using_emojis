ecm1zg,"I posted this as I watched it live in the Live Thread. In case anyone wasn’t able to watch the live debates this evening, Adam Schiff delivered the quote of this century which deserves its place in history. 


Adam Schiff waited patiently as John Ratcliffe delivered fire and brimstone against the Democrats, the Unfair Process, the Unnamed Whistleblower, and then cooly laid a fucking poetic sledgehammer and leveled every Republican response, in one line:

Rep John Ratcliffe, (R) Texas:   “History will remember this day as the day the Democrats impeached the president for nothing more than spite.”

Adam Schiff, (D) California;   **”Madam Speaker, I think when the history of this time is written, it will record that when my colleagues found they lacked the courage to stand up to this unethical president, they consoled themselves by attacking those who did.”**

Schiff is a uniquely gifted orator. These 39 words will be immortalized in history as one sentence which so brilliantly and concisely summarized the willing, blindful, repugnant actions of the GOP, offset by the Democrats trying to ballast our democracy by impeaching this dangerous and corrupt president.

**Edit**: Voting in 2018 made this happen. People were pissed, and disgusted, and exasperated, by the direction the country had gone under full republican control in *less than* 2 years. 

At that time I wasn’t sure if I was registered to vote, then listened to a podcast of Pod Save America (plugging them because I learn more from this podcast than any other on politics) they lead me to this link:

https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/

Folks, if you’re not sure if you are registered, or even if you are sure, just take the 30 seconds to confirm if you are registered to vote. And if you aren’t, well here ya go:

https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote

**Edit 2** Also adding the link to fair fight. 

This is the initiative Stacey Abrahms has initiated to protect voter registration rights, to stop funny business from unscrupulous voting suppression shenanigans the GOP has been deploying - thanks fellow Redditer for he suggestion. 


https://fairfight.com/

**Edit 3**  **(my favorite edit ever)**

*A fellow Redditer sent me a message just now, informing me they registered to vote, from the link I attached above. That is the best fucking result I’ve received of any single post I’ve ever submitted. Beats all the cool blings and upvotes and cool comments I’ve received on my two years on Reddit.

This piece of filth needs to be held accountable for the crimes he has commited if America is ever going to be able to taken seriously again. 
He and his hideous offspring and enablers who are all as criminal as he is all need to be tried for their crimes and have any assets that they actually do own stripped from them to repay the people they have wronged and then once they have been stripped of all assets that are not owned by the Mob then they all need to be put in Prison for the rest of their miserable lives.
If America is going to be able to mend and heal then trials for the criminals that have seized control are essential.
If the apparatus of the system will not do it then people need to take to the streets in numbers to demand justice for themselves but also in honour of the quarter of a million (probably more by time justice served) dead murdered by criminal negligence but also to honour the men and women who over the years have give their lives for a country they believed in and fought for the ideals that this orange coward is making a sham and a mockery of and selling to the highest bidders.

Has anyone that put their names on this ""petition"" given any thought to this other than a knee jerk response/reaction? Ofcourse the KKK is terrorist, but instead of finding out why this is they just assume it's been overlooked for what, almost 200 years?

Im not trying to be Cpt. Downvote here but come on America, the almost willful ignorance of history and congressional laws becomes glaring when so many sign a useless petition for a fictional designation; There is no list, nor has there ever been one, on domestic terrorist organizations originating -rooting from- inside the United States. (Legally official)
We have the Patriot Act that covers groups like this. The amount of ignorant people that want some type of tolken moniker, that legally means nothing, and literally DOES NOT DO ANYTHING, is a direct reflection of the mass populations lvl of education and ability to critically think. It's no wonder that the ""Illuminati"" (😂) or New World Order has started to implement significant depopulation efforts.

We have a constitution*, and personally, I'd rather have that than having a useless list that means nothing and doesn't hold any legal value. Now a petition to creat such a list; that, at least, would be productive.

Most senators and representatives are lawyers by trade and may not have the complex financial expertise to draft legislation that will effectively punish or discourage billionaire hedge funds and brokerages from halting client order flow without passing some consequences onto the individual retail traders.

I am afraid that they may introduce some new transaction cost on trades which may have a chilling effect on small individual traders, which would not only depress markets, but would also create a new barrier of entry to the individual investor.

Morons think one person has that much power and those same morons fall for any and everything that is told to them!

No man has that much power, weak minds GIVE a person that much power because they are spineless and too dumb to think for themselves but are under the delusion that they know everything when in fact nothing is known!

One can't formulate an accurate conclusion with a level of bias as high as the simple minds against good and doing what is right!

Both the left and right are in bed together. They talk shit about each other all day and then drink together at night!

These fucking annoying snek & alamo & trvmp2020 & Confederate flags (I live on N Padre Island) on every GD truck on the beach produces a rage I cannot contain anymore. 2 years ago I used to drive down the beach and find the confederate flags, take pictures, publicly confront and shame the dipshits flying them... In my view it was under control at the time, considering the rhetoric the racist t admin was pushing. Last summer... Well I was in chemo treatment and not allowed to swim at beach or in pools so I mostly stayed in bed, but I observed an overwhelming amount of confed flags on golf carts and trucks. Blue line flags are everywhere. When I walk out of my home I can see 1 blueline flag and 1 trump2020 flag at the homes of very close neighbors. I cannot explain how BADLY I want to relocate those flags but these ppl have pulled guns on cable guys in the past...

Bringing military in is beyond fvcked and me being a white woman- I can use my privilege to help shield black bodies. All the Christian evangelicals can dwell on whether or not it's okay for law enforcement to assault a cancer patient & mother of two young boys who strongly aligns with the idea that black lives are undoubtedly just as necessary and important as white lives are... (I'm using my situation as an example of how to push their ”morals” against themselves to create cognitive dissonance, when they see white women as victims of police brutality it will produce fear and anxiety/shock bc the idea that THEY TOO could be a victim enters their thoughts. The only way to enrage the majority of white america is to show them what they don’t believe and are in denial about--- cops are bad, cops hurt ppl, cops cover for other cops, cops can get away with murder- anyone’s murder. Until it becomes a WHITE PROBLEM only a portion of us will take direct action to demand a radical change in the systems poisoned by white supremacy... The ideals that built this country were solid in white supremacy. Combined with capitalism - we’ve got ourselves a future of continued inhumanity unless a massive shift occurs. The psychological trauma black ppl have been forced to endure every time a cop murders a black man or woman is PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE and so horribly devastating to the children who must be taught how to properly act if approached by a cop. I have two boys, it’s not fair that I won’t have to lose sleep afraid for their lives when they're old enough to leave the house by themselves or drive a car. EVERY mother can comprehend this, it's a matter of whether or not one is willing to go to those uncomfortable places in our minds. But that’s just it --- if you're white--- you can go to scary places IN YOUR HEAD and then leave! Imagine NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE! EVER! You can't turn it off or change the channel, it's always there and in your face. Where is the fvcking compassion and love for the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to senseless acts of police violence??? Why are we tolerating a racist sociopath running our country? We have the power to make him resign. We really do. 

We have the power to turn this country upside down and demand whatever we want, but those demands cannot be from white ppl. This isn’t about us and what we want. It's not our place to speak for black voices. Our place is to make their voices heard and to push back when the state tries to silence their voices. We will use our own bodies to shield theirs. It's the least we can do.

gvc4tw,"What if the person has a white and black parents? Which part is more is more dominant? Will that person be more likely or less to commit a murder?

And wouldn't it exempt them of fault? "" I'm sorry for the murder judge, I can't help it, it's my nature""?

What about when a white commit murder? Shouldn't them be forced to a dna test to see if there's any black in them, cause you know, he showed violent tendencies, there must be some black in him?

What about native Americans? Are they more likely to commit murder?

I bet you didn't know it but I'm your Lord 'n' Savior too,
And if you care, then best beware your state's about to turn blue.

Now your needs are second fiddle boy, but give your ""savior"" his due

jp257j,"Trump is a very bad nightmare that is going away. He a multifaceted abuser and bigot.  That has insulted, angered and lied about just about everyone of honor, intelligence, compassion and competence.  Too many cherished people have died of vivid and more will die without a national mask mandate, social distancing and cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. Don’t be stupid and take a life to an innocent person or put someone on a ventilator when it can be prevented. Believe in the science, listen to the scientists and the medical professionals. Don’t let Trump threaten the leaders in the field infectious disease.  Dr. Facicu (sorry sp). 
It’s disgraceful things Trump said about John McCain. I’m glad Cindy will take the state blue in honor of him.
Who would piss on a civil rights leader like our guy from Georgia. Good job Georgia and I want your peaches shipped to California. I’m so jealous.
Trump does not respect the military, the police ( regardless of what unions are saying ), he doesn’t respect people of color though he is afraid of you, doesn’t respect women either or leaders of other countries not even our neighbors or allies. 
His economic progress and policies are in the weeds because he screwed up with hiding civic and not taking immediate action.
He is not a well man.
Biden is going to win and Trump will through a hissy fit for the ages. He will fire those who oppose him without cause advance his pawns until he is dragged out of office.
He has repeatedly proven over the last 4 yrs that he doesn’t do anything quietly, smartly or with the best interest of our nation in mind.
I’m praying for no violence so pass it on.

t2suj2,">	The Russians always deploy massive disinformation campaign on multiple fronts.  

Really?  Tell us how they did it in previous elections then. And if it was so prevalent and effective, how come no one made it an issue until 2016. 

There had never been anything on the scale of 2016, because social media made it easy.  So much so that Mueller brought charges against 10 Russia based agents in 2016 for doing this, and the GOP chaired Senate Intelligence Committee had to do a full report investigation into it and demonstrated staggering amounts of such activity in its final report. 

Keep dancing around the bleeding obvious and insulting our intelligence with these silly arguments. 

You still haven’t answered the question why Putin chose to help Trump, not Hillary, if according to you, Obama and Putin were so friendly.  

>	Just happened to be an election this time - so what.  And it didn’t influence me one bit.

Your n=1 anecdote proves nothing, and TBH, I have zero reason to believe you, because the mark never knows they are the mark.  You begin to confirm it when the mark deploys the same arguments the troll farms were disseminating.    The Senate Report lays it out quite clearly - if you consumed Right Wing media you were exposed to it.    

>	It doesn’t take away from the point that every President has said more praiseworthy things about Putin, including Biden only 8 months ago calling him “tough, bright and a worthy adversary”, than Trump has said about Putin’s “smart move”.

This is not really an argument, and you need to stop deploying it.  It’s weak and it scores you no points.   Worse, it makes you seem obtuse, and wilfully so. 

It’s called diplomacy, and you usually get more with honey than with vinegar.   

So does Trump shaking hands and palling around with Kim Jung Il mean that are best buddies and the US and N. Korea are allies?  

Obama catching a ball game with Raul Castro in Havana?  Does that mean Cuba is our ally now?   Fidel Castro didn’t think so,  given his subsequent editorials in Granma.   

So the answer is clearly, No.  So…🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️

You need to go by actions.  Full stop.  Putin is not our friend, actively aids our enemies, and always works against US interests.  

Trump in *word and action* for anything involving Putin, always defers to Putin, in a shocking display of weakness and submissiveness by a US President towards a traditional rival, and worse, doing so went against our stated foreign policy interests. 

That is incredibly weird and incredibly suspicious, so much so that our intelligence agencies and Allies, especially in Europe, no longer fully trusted him.  Why?   And moreover, why do you continue to defend and excuse this behavior?  

It’s not even about the rhetorical question.  It simply he’s the POTUS and weak, wishy washy behavior, bordering on treason (Romney’s words, not mine) like that is utterly unacceptable. 

And in case you haven’t noticed, Putin’s move has been anything but “smart” the whole thing is blowing up in his face. 🤷🏻‍♂️",2022-02-28 13:37:29

mdm92z,"This is actually a misreading of the “Kraken” motion to dismiss. What the motion to dismiss actually says is that “Analyzed under these factors, and even assuming, arguendo, that each of the statements alleged in the Complaint could be proved true or false, no reasonable person would
conclude that the statements were truly statements of fact”. In other words the motion is saying that what Sidney Powell is saying is her opinion versus being an objective statement of fact. It’s not saying she doesn’t believe what she’s saying is true, it’s saying she’s expressing an opinion versus claiming something is an undeniable fact. It’s a pretty common motion in defamation cases, claiming that the defendant was only expressing an opinion and not “stating a fact” since defamation doesn’t apply to opinions.

Of course this motion is still a bunch of hot garbage. Sidney Powell literally claimed that she had evidence showing what she said about Dominion is true and even filed legal motions claiming it was objectively true, so the notion that what she said was “just an opinion” is farcical. But it’s important to understand her lawyers aren’t arguing that she lied, they’re arguing she was stating a subjective opinion.

ivub80,"Yes I clearly meant in that historical context by constitutional originalist. Most of us assume that the constitution extends to all, regardless of ethnicity, gender, creed, etc.. and no one wants to revert the constitution to that state, and especially aspects that define different peoples as unequal. It should go without saying especially in this day and age. 
And yes, it took some ""ammending"" to get things right, and some founding fathers even wanted to abolish slavery in the declaration of independence, but not enough were in favor.. originally one had to be a land owner to vote as well.. but centuries later we, or most, accept the constitution as it was finally corrected, and originally intended to be. To oversimplify the complex dynamics of such a geopolitical era and the many people from varying factions involved, with differing viewpoints, is foolish and dangerous. Not unlike what we're witnessing today: the broad generalizations and stereotypes used to lump massive amounts of diverse individuals into simple ""black & white"" (figuratively, though also applies to literal interpretation) labels, it is regressive, counterproductive, and dangerous. But hey, at least we can just blame all the divison and polarization on Trump, not the smear merchant propagandists of certain ""journalism"" and media outlets, which if one pays attention enough, it's not hard to see that Joseph Goebbels would be proud.. or just giddy with how easily swayed, public perception is.

l5knoq,"Form Prisons to Palaces

      Trying to get a movement started to assist ex-felons who served time in the Prison system to reintegrate back into society. I too served about 7 years in DOC, I really worked hard to change my life, I made my bid into a nightmare and my bid made a nightmare out of me. It was difficult at first, but with the right people by my side, I found ease, peace of mind and help getting myself back on track. I want to help give back, and offer ex-felons the opportunities that were offered to me, which is solid support, loyalty, and someone truly having your back. I’m here to listen and answer questions if that’s what it calls for, if you just want to read up and stay posted that’s cool too. No Judge Zone. 


                                 A little about me....

     Throughout my travels in the System, I self-taught myself everything I possibly can and took advantage of the programs that were given to me, but the majority of my knowledge came from books being sent in from my sister. I taught my self business math, technical analysis, how the economy works, how the flow of money works, and how to trade and invest in the Stock Market. But I’m forever a student and still continue to educate and re-educate myself even to this very day. 
   
      I’ve been working hard since I’ve been home, I was literally working close to 80 hours a week for a commissioned based job (roadside assistance)for a year straight. I barely made any money, but I had learned how to correctly budget my money, and always made sure to save(that is the🔑). So after this whole year of working through the COVID Pandemic, I decided I needed a better paying job with less hours. 
Because my job was starting to interfere with my relationship with my lady, I was always working, and with less hours I would be able to spend more quality time with the family.

       So I found another job, a lot of promise, great pay, a lot of paid vacations, PTO, insurance, you name it. I went to the interview and the manager seemed to love me, he said I scored one of the highest scores on the assessment test, and that I would be a great fit for the company. As soon as I got off the phone I put my 2 weeks notice in, and was finally happy to move up in my life. Two weeks later I am no longer with my previous employer and as I’m days near to start the new job, I got an email saying due to my background check I was no longer able to have the job. And just like that my hopes were literally crushed. 

      Of course at some point bad news after bad news starts spilling into your vibes, to the point it starts affecting relationships at which it can push a person into negative thinking and behavior. I am dealing with it RIGHT NOW!!!! Yeah it’s tough, but the bigger picture is definitely way more worth it than being back to being alone in a box. 
          
         I should be going to Puerto Rico with my Lady this week on the 26th, when I come back I will find another job and get back to grind mode. And of course I’m still trading while I’m on vacation, that is without a doubt.

        I’m going to start posting more frequently, see if anything good comes from this. I hope I can help and I will try to the best of my ability to do so. Let’s have each other’s back and build together, they will always try to divide us, because there is strength in numbers.

yqa3cg,"Well, my husband and I have talked openly about hard topics since they were in preschool. Their grandfather died and that’s kind of when we started having factual, not scary but also not trying to sugarcoat conversations while keeping it age appropriate. It’s a very delicate balance and I’ve made mistakes, but my kids are very honest with me as a result. They’re still little, so there’s no much to keep from me.. yet. My oldest starts middle school next year, so I’m trying to make sure our relationship is solid before that happens, especially since he’ll be getting a phone then.

Anyway, before they saw the ads, they knew roe v wade was overturned because I told them when the news broke. I explained what an abortion was, that it’s a woman’s choice, and that choice was taken away. I didn’t go into rape and incest then because, well… it didn’t seem age appropriate. Then that ad came along and put me in the hot seat and I told them the truth. They know the world is scary but that there’s more people who want to do good and that it’s important to find them and be one of them. We use the term “helpers” a lot.

>Researchers found that testing people for SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes COVID-19 -- too early in the course of infection is likely to result in a false negative test

Specifically this study was looking at the method of RT-PCR, which is not always the method used in conjunction with nose swabs. 

More relevant, however, is that your claim is pulling a conclusion from the data that is not there, that the researchers were not looking for. 

When you find a study specifically on accuracy of NOSE SWABS versus other testing methods for covid and not one focusing on POSITIVE TEST RATE VS DAYS INFECTED, come back to me 😉",2020-10-02 21:58:36

hpv5ug,"1. But does the US have the capability to respond to both threats to both China and North Korea without any other bases near South Korea (save for Alaska/Guam)?

2. From personal experience: Japan also gets a ton of money from the US in terms of rental of off base housing (rates for locals are significantly less than service members), contracting jobs on bases, and 6% of Okinawa’s economy is tied to the US military presence overall. So, while I can acknowledge that Japan does spend money on the US, there’s a reciprocal exchange of money from the US to Japan. There’s an agreement called SOFA that might go into more detail regarding the terms.

g2izpf,"That’s kind of misleading, first off, as Business Insider said, in the article, that this company’s *parent* company had not employed anyone since May 2018, and that they filed for [Chapter 11, bankruptcy protection,](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/differences-between-chapter-7-and-chapter-11/) where the company can ask their creditors to renegotiate the terms of their debt without worry about further compounding late fees (if any) or more interest rate hikes (if any), and is normally called the Rehabilitation Bankruptcy, because this allows a company to restructure their debt (**not** “wipe it free”) and then, after certain steps are met, can again enter the market again. This is a *big* difference from filing for Chapter 7, which is normally called Liquidation Bankruptcy, where the company 100% shuts down and, under direct bank (and/or government) supervision sells everything the company has ever owned, all the way up to real-estate and/or vehicles down to the last paper clip. The company ceases to exist. End of show.

Edit: still, paying this company, who has never worked with medical equipment, make a vitally important piece of PPE such as these masks, *plus* paying them $5.50 per mask (the normal price per item that the government pays is less than a dollar each) is kind of alarming.

jom0bi,"> The day after filing a petition, the Trump campaign lost an election lawsuit in Georgia on Thursday after two witnesses called by Republicans admitted under oath that they did not know whether the challenged ballots were received on time. Two witnesses for Chatham County’s board of elections affirmed that the ballots were on time.

> “They have been flatly incapable of proffering competent evidence to prove that point,” Jeff Harris, from the Democratic Party of Georgia, said in closing arguments.

> “Courts don’t resolve disputes about whether something may or may not be happening,” Harris added.

❌ Get more votes

How to win an election fairly:
✅ Prior to election stack Supreme Court with your mates
✅ Prior to claim mail in voting leads to voter fraud with no evidence provided, convince own followers they must vote in person
✅ Prior to election prevent swing states from counting early mail in votes before Election Day 
✅ Claim victory before mail in votes are counted, knowing the majority of which will be for the opposition.
✅ Scream VOTER FRAUD when votes go in favour of the opposition without any evidence
✅ Share FAKE NEWS - Get the family to do the same
✅ Attempt to stop legitimate votes being counted, prompt supports to turn up at counting stations with AR-15s
✅ Sue - anyone, for anything, the more frivolous the better.
✅ Ask your buddies in the Supreme Court to ignore the votes of 140 million people and just make you President anyway.

>Here's an actual study from a real scientific journal:

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7646092_Chloroquine_is_a_potent_inhibitor_of_SARS_coronavirus_infection_and_spread

There is ""limited evidence"" suggesting it does help.

Further they are allowing doctors to use it.

>We recommend initial evaluation and monitoring when using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine under the EUA or in clinical trials that investigate these medicines for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.  

https://www.fda.gov/media/136784/download

So healthcare practitioners can prescribe Chloroquine in these cases. The FDA advises caution and says evidence is limited.

My question is pertaining to the side effects of a newly developed and what would seem to me a severely undertested vaccine. Chloroquine is almost 90 years old at this point and its side effects are well known.

She was sleeping in her car and couchsurfing with her 5 kids after her rent blew tf up and all the shelters in Phoenix were waitlisted weeks if not months. Lost her good paying job- cant work from home if youre homeless. Helplines are saturated, and even the community foodbanks are tapped. I just helped her get into an apt that took her 2 months to find.

yvjde7,"Pretty impressive, all those voting machine problems for conservative voters in Arizona, so nice of the judge to be the only judge this year that I'm aware of, to deny request for an extension due to these issues with lines of conservative voters down the street and around the corner. Even cooler to elect someone who doesn't show up, who is afraid to debate but would rather defame hiding in the shadows, or comfortable drinking her Starbucks knowing the outcome before the counting even started.  
Would be nice if we had transparency from both sides, it's not okay to let half the country be pissed off and questioning election integrity. Or lying to them about issues while giving them a decrepit president.  
Kari Lake isn't done though, can't wait to see what she brings to the table! The left needs to get their shit together; numerous strong personalities on the right, I don't think the left has that charisma anywhere currently.  
PS - I don't subscribe to either party, I look for views more inline with my own, ya know, think for myself and have my own opinions. I think it's the right of the people and elected leaders to question election integrity. All I can say is that THE Truth™ doesn't mind being questioned........",2022-11-15 09:54:02

Those who think one party is better than the other and allows the media to manipulate them, keep them pitted against each other.

Thats why they spent 4 years trying to impeach him because he was pulling back the curtains and showing the wizard. Then he exposed the election truths the fraud and how elections were stolen to ensure that the governments president took office. Sheeple need to wake up this country is no longer ours it belongs to the corporations with their hand in the pocket of the congress and senate. The special interest parties that use governments to make their moves for them. This country is no longer ours the government proved that with their inability to be here for the American people when we needed them most. They held the country hostage forcing the lockdown the economic collapse and then stimulus to ensure they got their president in office. Mark my words we are in a dangerous time where sheeple are being force fed lies my the media news outlets and networks owned by people who have something to lose if they don't have a president in office that is willing to keep the dirty truth under wraps. You may not like trump I sure didn't but he was the only person willing to stand up for the people and fight for the peoples country. He was willing to fight against the evil and corruption and look at what lengths they were willing to go to just to ensure that we didn't have a voice...they have to impeach him or he will run in 2024 and ""They"" can't have that. This is the peoples republic, not a democracy...a country by the people and for the people dont ever forget your roots and where we come from.

Now I too have nothing but the utmost respect for him and would pretty much do anything he ordered me to do if I served under him. You too have an idea of his reputation and if you truly believe that he'd have sat idle while people tear down, vandalize monuments and attempt to harm others not just in the capital but around the country I absolutely and wholeheartedly disagree. I feel that his actions with the national guard would have been Swift and made a point that he won't stand for that behavior... Now maybe he's greasing up the future wheels for presidency down the road (🤞🏼 oh sweet baby Jesus please) so the best thing is to start spotlighting things he can do differently...

——— This shit is pointless. Honestly they should keep trading. Their trades are majorly public and that’s a huge perk to private investors and minor investors like your everyday middle class guy/ gal. Once it’s underground, these people have connections to keep it away from the public more-so than they do now. It’s a double edge sword when thinking about the full blockage of stock trades for most elected officials. In theory this could creat luxury / elite black markets, possibly creating an even wider rift due to well hidden corruption through our countries political elite. If you can bribe even one corrupt cop, you’ve got 50% of the power. This line isn’t 100% true, but still will resonate throughout time. “ Every one has a price” - *addition - I would like to hear rebuttals and reasons why this may be wrong thinking!

su3zob,"In essence, you don’t like the system, act to change it rather than cutting the cord to your tv or computer.  Violence and insurrection solve nothing in a nation of 300m. Politicians are inherently crooked because they have access to power. As a normal voter, even though I agree local politics can be dirty or crooked, i find it’s just old people set in their beliefs. I firmly believe that the American people can change from the ground up.  Without violence, perhaps maybe some boycott power.  Gen x’ers and millennials need to step into the arena and not fall prey to special interests groups and fundraising by lobbies. The “boomers” failed us. If you claim to be conservative, demand your conservative leaders cut spending. Balance the budget, rather than just keep racking up debt. The overplay is trying to run your govt like a business. It is not.   The left needs to put down some of their special interests and focus on reduction of govt spending to justify all the pet projects and theoretical social justice/ promotion that they hide behind.  Both parties are failing and there is no moderate so the new adults in the room need to step in and moderate, perhaps even take the lead.  It’s nice to see people getting into politics, regardless of how much or little money they generate,  we need to get fresh faces in there and get the old ranks off the treadmills in the congressional and legislative gyms and send them packing.  Then we will have some people to complain about who can at least communicate with the populous without falling asleep or having mental clarity issues. 
Just rambling.

Actually, when he was elected, they barely even tried to cover it up and flat out stated their number one goal was obstruction which highlighted how empty their policy palate was, and had always been, short of making the rich richer.

We went through the same stories, you could have asked me the same questions four years ago, I had to litigate this and had to talk about it. Totally fake news. Actually, I paid tax. And you’ll see that as soon as my tax returns – it’s under audit, they’ve been under audit for a long time, the IRS does not treat me well, they treat me like the Tea Party, like they treated the Tea Party, and they don’t treat me well. They treat me very badly. You have people in the IRS that treat me very, very badly. But they’re under audit. And when they’re not, I would be proud to show you. But that’s just fake news.”

If someone tells me they are pro life i don't assume they are a violent monster. So in that same vein, I see no problem labeling myself antifa or amti fascist.

Now, there are formal pro life organizations who may participate in some heinous crimes. I wouldn't wear their t shirts tp my next pro life event. Likewise, if you don't support the actions of a more formal local group with antifa in the name, such as ""rose city antifa"" or something in Portland, maybe don't wear a rose city antifa patch. But beyond that 🤷‍♂️

(An aside: I am vehemently anti-pro-life and also feel no shame aligning my self with even the more extreme actions of some antifascists. Those two points just don't factor in to the point I'm making: Don't hesitate to self apply antifa or antifacist as a label because you disagree with the actions of others who also do so. It's pretty cut or dry: You're anti-facist or you're not. Just because some yahoos don't understand what antifa means shouldn't change that.

We can always do better and share our love and kindness.

One ☝️ small act of love can change everything in a persons life.

Honestly I get pissed too. I’m guilty, but when I look at myself in the mirror arguing with my wife, with friends and so many others I ask myself “who is this man?”

I believe we have issues, some discussed, some blown out of scope and other that are ignored that are significant to all of us (aka the federal debt).

I just wanted to share that. Thank you. There’s no political motivation, I just want to put a smile on my face tomorrow and know I said my peace ✌️ to our community.

There was and is not a god damned thing democrats could/can do about it. The only way to do anything is to abolish the filibuster in the senate and pave the way for republicans to obliterate every single right you think you have during the next term.

SCOTUS was the fault of republicans which democrats could also, you guessed it, do nothing about. The republicans had a majority at the time and they refused to do their constitutional duty to appoint replacement justices until Trump was elected.

I find it actually funny that people are mad at them for doing nothing but sing because that's all they can fucking do. 😂 If you're a woman and you voted for a conservative, you have yourself to blame. And if you're anyone who didn't vote at all, shut the fuck up, you have no right to complain since you didn't aid the party of sanity win a supermajority.

You know the people who ask your opinion before giving you theirs? Some of those are hiding in there too. They're asking because they want to know how freely they can speak.

Do you know why there is hardly any cannibalism in nature?

Because evolution has led to such mutations becoming extinct.

Capitalism is cannibalism in economic form.

The lie of capitalism is to fool people into believing that everyone can achieve a certain standard of living if they are diligent enough. All of the living standards of our middle class. That is a lie and we must say goodbye to it for good. You see in this country that that is not possible. You can be as hard-working as you want. That doesn't help you in certain professions. As a doctor's assistant, as a pharmacy employee, as a cleaning lady, as a taxi driver, as a nurse in a retirement home, you can be as hard-working as you want. You never get on a green branch. None of this has anything to do with diligence, no, of course not. And whoever says: We need a low-wage sector to keep the economy going, says nothing more than that the standard of living of the middle class with a car and vacation and all the trimmings, the standard of living of this middle class can only be maintained if a third the population here works for board and lodging. Whether behind the wall or here in the neighborhood. You need these modern slaves. And you have to be honest - if you support this type of economy, then be honest, then say: I am like that. Get a tattoo of ""slave drivers"" on your forehead, everyone knows where it is. We have a democracy. You can also use the abbreviation, ""FDP"". Then you still have space for something else. ☺ But stop telling people that everyone can become something here. OK you can of course say: Anyone can get rich here. But not all. It's like the lottery. The big shit is, anyone can become a millionaire, but not everyone. In the lottery the chance is one in 140 million. Still, people play the lottery. Because they hope the one in 140 million is you! That 20 million have to throw away their money in order for one to become rich, that is the principle of capitalism. A small group gets richer and it gets better and better. And a growing group of people is getting worse and worse. And that is the principle of this economy. That is the effect of interest and compound interest. And if someone tells you anything else, they are either a complete idiot or an extremely unsavory body opening, ladies and gentlemen. ☺☺


Capitalism, which unrestrainedly exploits the planet's resources, deprives us of our own livelihoods. And people are also being exploited. And you don't even have to be a Marxist to understand that. You just have to take capitalism seriously.

m7xyy7,"Its an interesting comment in that it actually happened. W. Virginia did exactly that! Democratic Senator Robert Byrd, eulogized lovingly in 2010 by one Hillary Rodham Clinton, served 6 years in the house and 51 years in the senate starting back in 1952, not the best time for race relations mind you. Prior to his services to the DNC however he served as a KKK member, recruiter & ultimately caught the eye of Klan leadership and attained the lofty position of Exalted Cyclops in his local chapter...to quote the late one eyed snake, as late as 1946, Byrd wrote to the Klan’s Grand Wizard: “The Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia and in every state in the nation.” Shortly after that letter he was elected to serve in congress...the democrat part had grown steadily under his 57 years of service! 🤔

President Donald Trump has threatened to close down social-media platforms that he argues censor conservative voices after Twitter on Tuesday tagged some of his messages with a fact-check warning.

""Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday. ""We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016.""

>📷[**Donald J. Trump✔**@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump)Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can’t let a more sophisticated version of that....  
[59.3K](https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1265601611310739456)[6:11 AM - May 27, 2020](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601611310739456)[Twitter Ads info and privacy](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175256)

[30.5K people are talking about this](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601611310739456)

Twitter had long been criticized for allowing the president to spread conspiracy theories and smears against opponents despite its policies against the promotion of disinformation.

It recently came under increasing calls for it to take action against Trump after he spent weeks promoting a baseless conspiracy theory alleging that the MSNBC cohost Joe Scarborough was involved in [the death of a staffer](https://apnews.com/77f037f710ff48d4b0a7ef1a9c9bf106/AP-FACT-CHECK:-Scarborough-staffer-death-not-a-%22mystery%22), Lori Klausutis, while he was serving as a US congressman.

Twitter has declined to take action against the president for the messages about Scarborough, but on Tuesday for the first time it put a fact-check tag on some of Trump's tweets.

The president wrote two tweets claiming ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""

Twitter tagged each of the two messages with a blue exclamation mark and warning message, linking to articles in The Washington Post, CNN, and other outlets that debunk the president's assertion.

Trump doubled down on his voter-fraud claims in a follow-up tweet Wednesday.

""We can't let a more sophisticated version of that happen again,"" Trump wrote. ""Just like we can't let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!""

Trump has long accused social-media companies of bias toward conservatives. In [June 2019 he invited](https://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-social-media-summit-who-is-going-2019-7) several far-right provocateurs and conspiracy theorists, some of whom had had hate speech removed by social-media platforms, to the White House for a social-media summit.

He has also credited [being able to communicate on Twitter as a key factor](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/15/donald-trump-twitter-fox-news-interview-wiretapping) in his election to the White House, remarking that it allows him to communicate with voters directly, unfiltered by media organizations he accuses of partisan bias.",2020-05-27 14:22:41

He's a spoiled brat businessman who is used to getting his way, surrounded by yes-men whose purpose is to kiss his ass & stroke his bat shit crazy ego! That makes him the perfect candidate for reality tv... Not to be leader of a f#@*ing country! 

So please, my fellow Americans, lets just do our best to ignore his dumbass posts, (or just don't react. like a young child throwing a tantrum, Trump's desire is attention, so ignoring him might be best🤷‍♀️...) and work on replacing him asap!",2020-05-27 18:39:50

11mgaw2,"Since conservatives are so hellbent on dragging us back to the 1950s,we might as well go whole hog and reinstate the 90% effective tax rate on the wealthy they had then.

 It was precisely that high tax rate that literally built America and made us the #1 superpower of the world.

Wanna actually make America Great? Tax the daylights out of the wealthy.

And no, that doesn't mean upper middle class people, because no matter how much they try and front like they're rich, they aren't. 


We're talking the actual rich, like Buffett, Bezos, Elongated Muskrat, Peter Theil ,Koch brothers, The Greens, The Waltons etc .

We could tax just those few and literally end world hunger as well as give every man woman and child their very own house , full education, medical care, daycare, completely eradicate homelessness, and REFUND Social Security of the trillions Reagan and his billionaire cronies STOLE from it, and it would be solvent in perpetuity.

Yet, they would STILL be the richest people on earth. Still wallowing in their largesse like pigs in poop, and have exceedingly lavish lifestyles.

Won't hurt em but  tiny pinch if at all, and it will  save the rest of us and what's left of our country.  

Tax. The. Rich. It's the only thing left to do before America becomes a real life ""Modest Proposal"" that Johnathan Swift would be appalled and amused by it.

It’s not a midterm paper weighing in favor of theocracy. It’s a set of codes people ought to live by to take care of one another and vice versa. Jesus came into town and said “I’m your lord” and the people agreed. If you can believe it, the landlords of the time were not too happy. As a matter of fact the “civilized” courts of the time and Pilate nailed him to a board whilst Jesus, effectively a hobo revolutionary, spread a message of solidarity with neighbors and peaceful assembly. Tired of seeing the texts manipulated. Ironic that, it’s the atheist who brought the gospel to light. Even if you don’t believe in a higher power, these ideas of ethics, care, and acceptance live on beyond any nonsense theological set of premises. What freaks me out is how they came up with it in the desert with nothing over the span of 4500 years.. Truly a testament to the good striving heart of many humans.

Believe what you want. Love what and whom you want. I'm not gay and was conceived by a father with a penis and a mother with a vagina. I don't care about what people think, but that's how we all got here....male sperm and a female egg. 

I don't brag about being straight and for sure I do not promote the gay movement.  I teach my children  that if you are born with one part or the other then that's what you are period. A penis to penis and vagina to vagina does not create actual life. So not sure the gay thing will help sustain all life.

Heck even the animals in this planet are not that delusional.

I don't care what anyone says. Next time try and plug your sweeper into another sweeper or an outlet into another outlet. ( Doesn't work without the opposite connection.)

Why, because he has the support of God himself, to do what he promised to do, put traitors behind bars and remove them from the equation of destruction they unleashed around the globe. He is the greatest American that has ever loved, fought, sacrificed for His country,  His family was attacked like vultures, his vision, corrupted by incompetence and hate, coming from those within his inner circle and especially from the vile party that doesn’t even deserve a name.

his family is an example example of what it is to be an America, a family man who listens to God first, him and Putin are the best example of what it is to be a man, to fight against almost insurmountable odds and attacks by people who call Lucifer their “god”,  he not only has evidence that can fill a warehouse on the crimes Hillary, Obama, Biden and the rest of the morons of the apocalypse.

they are traitors, not only to you guys, but also God, who he profanes with every word that comes out of his mouth.   Biden, is excommunicated.

he Obama, and all those hiding in a bunker, are all excommunicated.  The entire democratic Party, the liberal party of Canada, are all excommunicated.

they had and now do not, any protection or grace from God.  In any way shape or form.

their only salvation is to go to the Pope, stop lying, admit their crimes pf fraud and theft, that people like Rumsfeld, who “lost” 2 trillion.

all of them are roasted turkeys, listen, to God, and support your real president, not only that, God has made him a king, of Scotland, Germany and the United States 🇺🇸.

because under no circumstances can Biden take control of nuclear weapons.

he is excommunicated and can never 👎 be president.  He is a tool of Satan, that is who he worships.

have a merry Christmas Donald, and if you see this, and read this, you have the support of billions, God and all of Creation.

so have zero fear, to do what is right, they all deserve a prison cell, not a White House desk.

All to drop off a laptop for repair, coincidentally at a huge MAGA fan shop. 😉 he decided to never pick up his own laptop. 😉
There’s security footage of it, but it got lost. Epstein style. 😉 But don’t worry- the MAGA man swears he saw him drop it off. Turns out he has a mental condition where he CANNOT RECOGNIZE FACES (I’m not joking) he knew it was hunters though, cause of the stickers on the laptop... 😉 MAGA man, naturally, didn’t just erase and resell the laptop, but did the totally normal thing of duplicating the hard drive and spending hours sorting through thousands of emails to find one that suggests Hunter might’ve tried to arrange a meeting with daddy Biden 😉 no evidence any meeting ever occurred, but who cares.
In comes Rudy Giuliani, cyber security expert, and talking set of teeth -who was tricked by Borat, and periodically butt dials reporters on accident -he has ‘confirmed’ the info not even the FBI could. 😉 Rudy was so worried about the intel, he sat on the laptop for months until 3 weeks before the election. 😉
Naturally, it proves Hunter was into pedo devil sex too, but the proof is secret and for Rudy’s eyes only. 😉 there’s a video of said drug fueled sexcapades, but again, you just gotta trust rudy 😉
Rudy refuses to send any electronic proof of the emails to anyone. But it’s definitely real, and definitely exists 😉 Heh. Again- not a single news agency has actually seen any proof, except for photos of printed emails. This is why ThEY WoNT CoVeR iT
He was ‘confirming’ it the same time Trump received an intel briefing that Rudy was unknowingly being used by Russian operatives to spread disinformation. Lmao.
Rudy, tired of getting made fun of, tweets some more ‘source material’ text messages... except the text is in an app that didn’t exist at the time it supposedly happened, and...literally in Russia. Poor guy.
This was all also investigated by a real Post reporter who refused to put their name on it, as no part of it could be verified. Several news outlets also passed on the story for the same reason, including FoxNews and WSJ. Ended up written by Sean Hannity’s producer. Lol.
Now comes a guy named Bobulinski - alleging he, uhh met with Biden to discuss a Chinese business deal😉. He has proof, of course: ‘documents’ he says 😉 naturally, he actually hasn’t released anything.
The WSJ opinion section finally publishes a Bobulinkski piece. Note: opinion section, not news, as they still couldn’t verify anything. It alleges the above Chinese deal. They very next day, the WSJ news section refutes the entire thing, using Bobulinksi’s own source material. 😆
Here comes Tucker Carlson. He is about to release a bombshell. All the emails. Proving everything. Unfortunately, these apparently only existed as single physical copies. The emails. Electronic mails. Only existed as one physical copy. (Got that?). Sadly, these printed non-electronic emails were lost (stolen!) in the mail, and no one ever made a copy 😉, so we may never know which dog ate Tucker’s homework or who made-up this made-up story.
Next up is Martin Aspen, Swiss intelligence operative. He is the basis for many of these allegations and brought it public in a dossier that the PRESIDENT received.. it turns out he is not real. Literally, they made his face on a face generator and gave him a cute linkedIn profile at a fake company. Probably just a cover for the deep state. 😉

Howard's own treasurer, Peter Costello, described John Howard as a [""poor treasurer,""](https://www.news.com.au/national/costello-puts-the-boot-into-john-howard/news-story/a695ea57d597f92f869644c793366a5d) partly because he wasn't even a conservative economic manager. For a supposedly right-wing party leader, he [""failed conservatives.""](https://www.afr.com/opinion/dont-be-nostalgic-for-john-howard-he-was-a-bigspending-biggovernment-pm-20170518-gw7lkv)

[""The Howard treasurership was not a success in terms of interest rates and inflation,""](https://www.smh.com.au/national/howard-failed-as-treasurer-says-costello-20070719-gdqnhj.html) said the economics expert on Howard's team; the longest-serving treasurer in Australian politics.

And it's not like the more liberal side of the spectrum was happy with him either. Bob Hawke once said that [""the worst economic manager that this country's had since federation was John Howard,""](https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/howard-buggered-up-the-economy-20071025-ge64q9.html) so neither side of the spectrum was particularly impressed.

[He couldn't even hold his own seat](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/failure-in-2007-was-all-howards-doing-20101026-172aw.html). When did finally leave politics, his own electorate didn't even want him. He claims that he [was planning on retiring,](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/failure-in-2007-was-all-howards-doing-20101026-172aw.html) for which Costello [called him a liar](https://www.smh.com.au/national/howard-failed-country-and-party-costello-20101026-172d4.html).

***

But let's give Howard the benefit of the doubt. After all, Costello was the treasurer under Howard's leadership. Howard and Costello were given a [""promising""](https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/we-really-must-talk-about-the-howard-and-costello-economic-disaster,5686) economy. Based on the IAREM, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating had lifted the economy [from 20th place in 1982 to 6th place in 1996](https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/we-really-must-talk-about-the-howard-and-costello-economic-disaster,5686), when Howard and Costello took control and failed to keep it.

Costello, the treasurer under Howard, was given [scathing reviews](https://www.theage.com.au/opinion/we-want-the-truth-about-the-currency-losses-20030724-gdw3in.html). ""What has happened under Costello's watch is a major financial disaster. ... Costello and his advisers are making a mockery of their responsibility to Parliament.""

***

And then came along the Global Financial Crisis—a global recession like never seen before. [Kevin Rudd navigated Australia through the Crisis like no other world leader](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/australia-you-dont-know-how-good-youve-got-it-20130901-2sytb.html). The Labor government under Rudd prevented a recession in Australia while the rest of the world was crumbling around us. Rudd's achievements as an economic leader are still being celebrated ten years later.

[""Australia’s economy was not only the best in Australia’s history but the best in the world — by a mile. Some say the best the world had ever seen.""](https://www.crikey.com.au/2017/11/24/kevin-rudds-economic-legacy-10-years-on)

To be fair, some people would say that Rudd, and his treasurer Wayne Swan, were blessed by [""inheriting a sound economy,""](https://www.euromoney.com/article/b12kjctcvjm011/press-release-australias-wayne-swan-named-euromoneys-finance-minister-of-the-year) but lots of countries had ""sound"" economies in 2007. Even if we can agree that Howard and Costello didn't completely tank the economy, they still couldn't compete with Rudd and Swan.

Wayne Swan was named Euromoney's Finance Minister of the Year 2011, and his response to the Global Financial Crisis is cited as as a reason why.

[""[Australia] has been the best performing of the world’s developed market economies ... Australia’s position within the global financial community has never been stronger than it is today. [September 2011]""](https://www.euromoney.com/article/b12kjctcvjm011/press-release-australias-wayne-swan-named-euromoneys-finance-minister-of-the-year)

***

In 2013, when Labor lost the federal election, they handed [the single best economy in the world](https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/australia-tops-the-iarem-worlds-best-economy,6279) over to the LNP—something the LNP was [immediately criticised for squandering](https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/worlds-best-economy-australia-loses-top-spot-under-coalition,7616).

By 2019, after six years of a Coalition government, Australia's economy had [slumped to a miserable 28th place](https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/worlds-best-economy-2019-no-not-the-coalitions-australia-,13272). The Labor government were the best economic managers in the world for three straight years, and then every year of a Coalition government, our performance on the world stage got worse and worse.

***

As for backstabbing and mutiny, we had two Labor leaders in two terms of office, followed immediately by three different Coalition leaders in three terms of office, so I hardly think there's much room to point fingers in that regard.",2020-11-05 11:15:12

I would equate this to a RICO case for the mob. Plain and simple. It has everything about it plus domestic terrorism. Proof is what matters here and the people who pointed at the fire are the ones who also started it. Clear as day.

Edit: 60 court cases failed because of no evidence, bill barr who ran a trump created group that for years looked into voter fraud and found nothing (before any of this happened) was fired because he said there is no evidence. Trump appointed judges dismissed multiple cases because of no evidence. I think its pretty clear what the facts are.

Edit the twice: Trump has consistently for most of his public life used the argument of ""its rigged against me"" for lots of things even before he was president, aka the Emmys for the apprentice, ummm even the Nobel prize  😆 easy to look up and verify these things. Its all there on camera with audio for the whole world to see. So if he wants to say that he fully believes this shit argument,  I'm sorry but thats not acceptable based on his own actions.

As a Southerner from a racist family, it is quite cathartic playing a lowly Union infantryman in War of Rights with my bayonet affixed, charging the Rebel scum with this blasting over someone's open mic! 😊

HISTORY EDIT:

OMFG I had no idea these alternate lyrics to Dixie were sung by Union Soldiers during the Civil War! That's so badass!!!

>Away down South in the land of traitors,

>Rattlesnakes and alligators,

>Right away, come away, right away, come away.

>Where cotton's king and men are chattels,

>Union boys will win the battles,

>Right away, come away, right away, come away.

>Then we'll all go down to Dixie,

>Away, away,

>Each Dixie boy must understand

>That he must mind his Uncle Sam.

kiwvyy,"I see it also as this: that people who are rich may find living a “good” life and keeping commandments easy due to lack of want, while keeping community in compassion and empathy is much more difficult. Wealth is isolating. Jesus remarked that the greatest commandment is to love one another (actually it is part two of the greatest commandment, the first being to love god). 

Those who are poor labor in the muddy area of survival where keeping commandments is more difficult, while perhaps actually living in compassion is something they experience more regularly in their communities. Someone who is poor may have many many more opportunities to love truly, to rely upon others, and recognize the value of others in their interdependence. In this way a person who has not kept any commandments might come first in terms of “goodness”.

By leaving his wealth behind, the rich person gains this perspective and opportunity, even as his ability to devote himself to rules and commandments flies along with his leisure time.

However. I also see this same bullshit as romanticism for poverty and we don’t need anyone thinking how much more noble and close to god poor people are. These parables break down if you press them too hard. Best to keep the reading as light as you can.

😄
For what it's worth (and I'm not saying no one shreds the letters), writing is impactful.

I used to call people on various issues, get their feedback while taking notes, offer to write a letter on their behalf, send them copies of the letter to approve and then the company I worked for would send those letters to their representative.

These campaigns cost millions and were (are) done on all types of topics from both sides of the argument, and if writing wasn't effective, those millions would be spent elsewhere.

Obviously it doesn't fix everything, I just don't want anyone thinking they don't work.

The problem is as I found out before quitting that work, we would give biased and cherry picked information to get the types of responses there people who were paying wanted so our politicians were hearing what the companies wanted from their respective constituents.

So it's worth considering that every letter you write on your own cancels out a letter from those who profit from paying to have these calls and letters done in the first place",2022-09-08 14:53:57

\----

Sources say that Trump referred to the 1800 Marines who died in a WWII battle as ""suckers"" and ""losers"", will this make you reconsider your support?

>Trump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead, according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day. In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed

And on the subject of John McCain:

>he expressed contempt for the war record of the late Senator John McCain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese. “He’s not a war hero,” Trump said in 2015 while running for the Republican nomination for president. “I like people who weren’t captured.”",2020-09-03 22:20:43

**Edit:** Yes, of course The Dems have ~~officially nominated~~ not nominated Biden yet, though he now has enough delegates. No matter who you supported in the primary, it is time to come together - and organize others if you can - to vote blue. In case some crazy thing happens at the DNC and Dems are don’t nominate the delegate tally winner, any Democratic candidate will be immeasurably a much better president. This is it. This is the most critical election of our lifetime.🙏🏻
  
**Edit 2:** The NYT report was pretty detailed too, I just couldn’t share it because they put up their paywall (yes, I am a NYT paid subscriber and I support them, but not everyone here is a subscriber), but here is the web capture archived link I generated:

The name of the school was Robert E Lee High School. This poor kid lived his whole life in Long Beach and I was so worried about him I talked to him and his parents in a conference and we had a long discussion of the challenges he would face. I gave him a bunch of resources like the local ACLU hotline and the local NAACP as well as The Southern Poverty Law Center and told him to call me personally if he was struggling. Poor kid 😢,2022-02-11 15:28:59

Trump, from receiving the intelligence briefings traditionally conducted for former presidents, saying he could not be trusted because of his “erratic behavior” even before the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

Edit: The salient point begins on page 9 sub heading 2.


**2. Capacity and utilization data: where/how to submit?**

Hospitals and acute/post-acute medical facilities should report daily capacity and utilization data through *only one* of the methods below, to the Federal Government. Facilities can report to their State if they have received a written release from the State and the State has received written certification from their ASPR Regional Administrator to take over Federal reporting responsibilities. If the State assumes reporting responsibilities, the State can also choose to utilize one of the below channels or to follow a format similar to that in Appendix A through the State portal at Protect.HHS.gov.
Reporting options for hospitals and acute/post-acute medical facilities:

* If your state has assumed reporting responsibility, submit all data to your state each day
and your state will submit on your behalf. Your state can provide you with a certification if they are authorized to submit on your behalf.


* Submit data to TeleTrackingTM [https://teletracking.protect.hhs.gov]. All instructions on the data submission are on that site. To become a user in the portal: (This portal is will have the new and updated fields ready as of July 15, 2020)
o Respond to the validation email sent to your administrator.
o Visit https://teletracking.protect.hhs.gov and follow the specific instructions on
how to become users.

* Each facility is allowed to have up to 4 users for both data entry and
visual access to aggregated data in the platform. 


* Users will be validated by the platform.

* Authorize your health IT vendor or other third-party to share information directly with HHS. Use one of the above alternate methods until your ASPR Regional Administrator or HHS Protect notifies you that this implementation is being received and is compliant.

* Publish to the hospital or facility’s website in a standardized format, such as schema.org. Use one of the above alternate methods until your ASPR Regional Administrator or HHS Protect notifies you that this implementation is being received.",2020-07-15 12:52:17

And Trump incited them as well, very clearly. They attempted again, and it turns out these were the same bad dudes who had stormed before, and it was discovered that their absolute intent was to lynch her. They had only amped up. 

As a Michigan resident this scared me to my core. It showed how vulnerable we had become to the stirring up and fomenting of hate and lies and how far people now identifying as the Real Patriots™️ were now willing to go. 

This went right off the rails months and months ago. And that’s being stingy with my dates.

3. Locker room talk
4. Stormy Daniels affair
5. Gassing people in front of a church (how can any Christian still support him)?

luehib,"I came here to inform myself about the headline. I mostly see people trashing Republicans. But everything being said about them can be said equally true for Democrats. NEITHER  of them have OUR best interest at heart. Please know this. If you are For America, you must be against both of these parties fundamentally. And if you feel that your vote won't count voting third party its totally understandable. So if you must vote for one of them, use your mind, and not your heart to choose the lesser evil. These people are legislators. They make laws. Laws are not the playing field of feelings. Laws are to be understood in the mind. More laws is equal to less freedom/liberty.  The reason i feel compelled to put this here, is that Democrats have been making tremendous appeals to people's feelings.  Cries of racism, sexism, hatred.... and at the end if these empassioned cries is always a call for another law. A law that is almost impossible to get rid if once its on the books. Republicans have been doing it too with their attempts to appeal to patriotic feelings, and painting the Democrats as un-American.  Same game, but the difference RIGHT NOW is that Republicans aren't trying to push new legislation to permanently remove civil liberties from anyone. For example: this talk of reparations. It may sound amazing to many. Free stuff from the government.  But nothing is really free. We borrow money every year from China because these stupid politicians refuse to balance the national checkbook. And when they don't play ball, we pay the price by having our national parks shut down, and our friends and family who serve in the military,  or work for federal govt jobs dont get paid. They hurt us, and hold us for ransom until both parties sign off on more debt they can't pay. So where do these reparation monies come from? Prolly China.  And if China is lending the people's government money, shouldn't all of the people be entitled to it? So the point is, if I, and my ancestors never owned slaves, but my government is giving free money to black people, while sending the message that without those reparations,  those people can never elevate their station in life- it is racist. Next the Democrats want to take our rifles. The constitution was never intended to be negotiable. If people you voted for see it that way, they are your enemy. The constitution was drafted to protect from tyranny plain and simple. The fathers of this country weren't perfect. But they were wise. They had just fought a bloody war with inferior weaponry and somehow they won. Each and every right enshrined in our constitution is intended to check tyranny.  Democrats want you afraid of rifles. They want you afraid of people who own rifles. And they want you to loathe people who defend the 2nd amendment. Because if you are cheering them on while they castrate American society they can do so unchecked, and continue to rewrite all laws in ways that suit them. In the name of oppression. If you hate the liberties enshrined in our constitution,  or feel so strongly that America is an inherently bad country please relocate. But please do not let yourself be indoctrinated by fox News, or CNN or any other mainstream propaganda into thinking that more Laws is equal to more happiness.  Its equal to oppression.  Less laws is more freedom and more liberty, and the more choices you are free to make, the more likely you are to be happy. The media and the parties want you to vote your identity. They want you to hate your neighbor who thinks differently than you. Because if they can keep ratcheting up the temperature to where people feel unsafe, people will cheer as they are stripped of liberty. Think of every useful thing that can be dangerous when used as a weapon. They, meaning all of the politicians on a long enough time line, will ban every dangerous thing they can if you are cheering for it. They will ban guns, cars, planes, gasoline. True freedom is dangerous. Be free to skydive, race motorcycles, learn chemistry, build, grow, and pursue your happiness in life. The only things that can hinder you are your government,  and the prison in your mind that you willfully enter based on your feelings. Your feelings can be leveraged against you. The more sad, angry, depressed, or oppressed the media makes you feel, the less free you will become. It has nothing to do with the people they villify. It has everything to do with two very corrupt political parties, who get richer no matter what you do because they manipulate markets, and never let a good tragedy go to waste. Please if you want a brighter future really look at the political establishment for what it is. Fundamentally against you. And every law passed is less freedom. Freedom is dangerous. Think for yourself. And if you read this whole thing this🌟 is for you. Thank you and have a good day.",2021-02-28 15:54:29

But I digress, she’s upset that a senator (not governor, mind you) in a time where the senate is closed/not in session took a trip, while at the same time the GOVERNOR of her state is being investigated for corruption, two sexual harassment accusations and I won’t be surprised to hear that the democrats want to impeach Cuomo after all this is done. 

Also, why the hell would a state winterize when they don’t typically get polar vortexes? And what do you need to winterize? Oil. They literally grease the turbines using helicopters. 

So what’s the point of all these renewables if they can’t be reliable, and if it takes fossil fuels to maintain their operations? Come on man!

They hired me there as their ""token Republican"" because I was just a kid from conservative eastern Washington who was deeply involved in Republican politics at the time. I learned a lot about professional journalism from Marcie Sillman, Steve Scher, Ross Reynolds, and of course Brian. If we didn't have both sides of the story we didn't air it. Whether it was conservative or liberal. I really respect this news organization and fully trust that whatever they are doing is in the best interest of the listenership.

So they asked for a bailout and so far the answer is no.

I don’t like Trump, but I can NOT wrap my head around how everyone just absorbs these media stories when almost all of them subverting proper context to convince. Even if it fits the narrative you support, you shouldn’t accept obvious misconceptions. They are basically lying to all of us whether we want it to be true, or not. That’s why Trump received almost 75 MILLION votes. He grew his base by 12 million and the insanely biased media that alters context is why. 🙃

l0u5dd,Lol like this is complete on trump. So guys maybe you haven’t heard but there is a global pandemic so obviously the economy is going to get worse. Also before the virus the economy was better than ever. Also it’s not trumps fault that idiots like Andrew Coumo and Gavin Newsom kept everything locked down destroying the small businesses. There is a reason everyone is moving out of California and into Texas and Florida. Because they don’t tax there people into the dirt! Also I just like how Andrew coumo said we need to start opening businesses right as trump was about to leave office😂. And know because the economy was bad before Biden got there anything bad he does isn’t his fault it is just trumps legacy sucking the life blood out of America even after his is gone.

j6piiv,"My hope for America is that Joe can become the next FDR ~
With Americans ready to evict the unpopular Herbert Hoover from the White House, the time was ripe for Roosevelt to ascend to the presidency. While the American people must have wondered about electing a President in a wheelchair with a myriad of health problems, Roosevelt promised a ""new deal"" and he certainly delivered by implementing a variety of innovative policies.

FDR's mandate as a first-term President was clear and challenging: rescue the United States from the throes of its worst depression in history. 

                   To help him, FDR depended on a sizable coterie of advisers to a degree unprecedented in the history of the presidency.

“this cannot be a partisan moment. It must be an American moment. We have to come together as a nation.” He promised to get rid of the toxic partisanship that is keeping us all off balance. “I’m running as a Democrat,” he said, “but I will… govern as an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you... and those who see each other as fellow Americans who just don’t live in red states or blue states but who live in and love the United States of America. That’s who we are.”

REMARKS BY VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IN GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA
(Excerpt)
Please read his full address when you have time https://joebiden.com/2020/10/06/remarks-by-vice-president-joe-biden-in-gettysburg-pennsylvania/

It cannot be that after all this country has been through. After all that America has accomplished, after all the years we have stood as a beacon of light to the world, it cannot be that here and now, in 2020, we will allow government of the people, by the people, and for the people to perish from this earth.

No. It cannot. It must not.

We have in our hands the ultimate power: the power of the vote. It is the noblest instrument ever devised to register our will in a peaceable and productive fashion.

And so we must.

We must vote.

And we will vote no matter how many obstacles are thrown in our way. Because once America votes, America will be heard.
Lincoln said: “The nation is worth fighting for.”
So it was. So it is.

Together, as one nation, under God, indivisible, let us join forces to fight the common foes of injustice and inequality, of hate and fear.
Let us conduct ourselves as Americans who love each other — who love our country and who will not destroy, but will build.
We owe that to the dead who are buried here at Gettysburg.

And we owe that to the living and to future generations yet to be born.

You and I are part of a great covenant, a common story of divisions overcome and of hope renewed.

If we do our part. If we stand together. If we keep faith with the past and with each other, then the divisions of our time can give way to the dreams of a brighter, better, future.

This is our work. This is our pledge. This is our mission.

We can end this era of division.
We can end the hate and the fear.
We can be what we are at our best:
The United States of America.
God bless you. And may God protect our troops.

                             ISSUES

The rumor that he supports forced conversion therapy and camps has been debunked.  Not only that, it was one statement over 20 years ago.
However, he has voiced his support in the past for the use of federal funds for “treatment for people who wish to change their sexual behavior” so they would be at less of contracting HIV/AIDS. The ‘wish to change’ part means the treatment is consensual and not the Holocaust for homosexual people as many of the conversion therapy camps that queer teens were forced to endure.

Not one of them is independently wealthy. 
I ask them the same question as to why they vote the way they do. 
      The most sickening answer I've received is so that the welfare rats don't get any more money🤢

Ill tell you this my fellow redditors. My family is quite large.
In the early days we were ALL on state aid. A family of 9, my mother couldn't get a job to support all of us. 7 kids in a 9 year time span!!! Pause for 5 then me. Then dad went for a pack of smokes when I was just under 18 months old. 

Every single one of my siblings went on aid when they got pregnant. Out of 5 girls only one was married before pregnancy.
Her husband knocked her around one time and she split.
Lived with an aunt and received state aid for a few years. 

My brothers were the same with their girl friends.  Unwed and knocked up. Living off of aid and living with the father of the child!!
 
But now, either not voting or voting GQP?????.   Not one of them can give a reasonable answer as to why the billionaires and the corporations that own this country and the politicians that serve themselves should receive tax breaks and handouts in the billions while tens of millions of people don't have basic insurance. 

Im utterly dismayed by the ignorance and outright stupidity of these people. We are all getting ripped off and they either don't care or don't understand.  

They've been lied to and can't,  or refuse to,  admit it.

The flowers have been there as long as the homes and so it’s really easy to look at this on the outside and say “oh that’s beautiful, look how gorgeous it is!” and just completely ignore that there are probably slave bodies feeding a good portion of those bushes. People used to have to prune those bushes or get whipped or worse. 

They have these really pretty girls stand outside the houses all dressed up in lacy gloves and hoop antebellum skirts. The pastels always distract you away from the complete picture: there are maids with those girls like representations of old quaint southern life...including slaves. When I was very little, I wanted to be an azalea trail girl but when I got a lot older and moved away from Alabama I was very glad I never got to be one. It’s just flaunting the way things used to be like they were perfect and everything was sunshine and sweet tea,  it’s like people completely forgot that slavery was how we got those huge houses and the cane for the tea, how we amassed such wealth on the bones of others.

From a friend who actually lives in Minneapolis:

“Suburban and out of state friends. I’m not sure if the media is talking about this or not. Minneapolis is being burned to the ground by white supremacists, proud boys, boogaloos, alt-right...seriously take your pick. White men are breaking the windows, white men are starting fires, white men are starting fights. This is an arrogant tactic by people that think they are too clever for anyone to figure out what they are doing. Help let the world know that we are under attack by outside forces and the police are more concerned with shooting rubber bullets and teargas at peaceful protesters then the actual people who are causing destruction.

Copy and paste this to spread the word.

Just an added personal note, we are safe, but the situation is getting scary. Last night our house shook all night, from the helicopters over head. The bank and post office six blocks from our house burned. A gas station six blocks away burned. The Jamaican restaurant six blocks away had to be protected as vans of white supremisists sat and waited for them to let their guard down. These are no longer protests, these are outsiders coming to create chaos. Uptown businesses are pretty much all decimated. Not one person arrested last night in St Paul was from the state, and there are more coming today. Gov Walz said 80% of arrests last night were people not from here.

It’s been reported the fbi was looking for nuke docs. That is not the same thing as the doj or fbi telling us that via a court document or a press conference. It isn’t confirmed. Do not treat this as fact yet. 

Hell, this could even be a trump leak so when it’s not that, his guys can be like “see? No nuke docs.”

Even if it is confirmed, we don’t know anything further. I’m seeing people talking about treason, selling it to foreign governments.. that’s nothing but speculation based on reporting that MAY be true. 

My honest opinion.. if this were true, one, holy fuck. But why hasn’t he been arrested? Is this the sort of crime the doj lets people walk around free for when they know you did it? I don’t think it is.

Oh, I almost forgot. You’re telling me the former president had sensitive nuclear weapon documents in his possession, and Biden wasn’t made aware? Hmm. 

This doesn’t smell right. It just doesn’t.

**Edit 8/13 3pm:** 

So, this gained some traction. I haven’t replied because I was banned for a day from r/politics, who claimed a post I made saying I “value facts over scoring points” was baiting other users. I do not see it that way, but I’m not a mod 🤷‍♀️

I’m going to clarify a few points. 

One, I think Trump committed multiple felony crimes. Not just here, but throughout his presidency and on Jan 6. He should be in jail. 

Two, I didn’t doubt he had TS information, or documents. When I posted, people were claiming (sans proof) that Trump had sold nuclear weapons information to hostile foreign governments. Maybe he did, but you sure as hell don’t know that yet. We still don’t know if he actually had nuclear related documents at all. We may never know. That’s the nature of this story. 

Three, I’ve been accused of defending trump, concern trolling etc. To be extremely clear, I’m likely far more progressive than you are. I’m a gay and trans progressive, and I have an extensive post history proving it. That doesn’t mean I’m a partisan hack. I will try to speak from facts, not speculation. I will not score easy points only to be proven wrong a few days later because I didn’t have the full picture. I will use my fucking head. 

I could be wrong here, I fully acknowledge that. If the worst you can say about my politics is that I was too slow to jump to conclusions, I’m fine with that reputation.

I do want to thank the people who awarded my most downvoted post ever, while cautioning trump supporters that no, I’m not a fan of your boy. We are not the same.",2022-08-12 02:03:17

Hence, negating the actual wishes of voters in a given area. 🔹These new non-democraticly elected reps and senators go to Washington where they vote according to their own financial interests instead of according to the needs of their districts.  🔹 They write, amend, and abolish laws that further their own financial interests and laws that shore up their longevity in office.  🔹 They protect one another at the expense of the American people.... A lot of ""you scratch my back/I'll scratch yours"" going on.  🔹 If (or when) they get caught amidst their criminal activities, their only recourse is protection in the court system via crooked, criminal minded judges that they themselves have chosen.  (This is why McConnell and Trump have worked so fervently to install judges..... most of whom are unqualified and have never tried a case in court. They pass out prestigious lifetime appointments in exchange for them turning a blind eye to the administration's crimes and greed.) 🔸The entire purpose of lifetime appointments is supposed to be to keep the judges free of crooked political influence.

Inequality in general is so much worse than most people realize and there's plenty of information that proves it. So, where to start?

[The ultra-rich are hoarding as much as $32 trillion ($32,000,000,000,000) in offshore accounts to avoid taxes.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth-idUSBRE86L03U20120722) As a way to understand just how much 32 trillion is, let's use time as an example. One million seconds is 12 days, and one billion seconds is 31.7 years. That's already a massive difference between a million and a billion, but how much is 32 trillion seconds? It's over a million years.

Most people know that wealth inequality is a huge issue, but they don't understand just how bad it is. Here's an example: **If you had a job that paid you $2,000 an hour, and you worked full time (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much money as Jeff Bezos.**

Republicans just cba to borrow money, because despite every European country doing it in far greater amounts for the entirety of the pandemic, they claim it’s “too dangerous”. The Trump administration actually raised the deficit, btw. They can’t seem to make up their minds.

I would like to suggest that we make the new President sign a contract where it is confirmed that the next President will keep their personal opinions to themselves.

Or, let’s come up with the “characteristics” that we can all easily agree on. A baseline. Then go through a process of eliminating and qualifying as we go? 

What else could we possibly have to do with our time? 

This is a very serious situation and we need to pool talented minds to resolve this problem. 

I will go first. I would like the President of the United States to be a representative of how we want to see and be seen as the American 🇺🇸 people.

Likewise when they say they love ""America"" for them ""America"" is a euphemism for white supremacy. So... Anything that's NOT advancing neofascist white supremacy is to them what they call ""anti-American"".

It's really time that we stop playing nice with these people. The country isn't exactly rewarding Democrats for ""going high"" when Republicans ""go low"".

vklb2z,"The Democratic Party started in the 1820s. Right away, it switched sides, as we can see from the fact that they pushed for the removal and extermination of Indians. Also, their opposition was the Whig party, which was against the Indian Removal Act and vowed to protect minorities against mob rule. Because the sides were switched, the vast majority of Whig party were anti-slavery.

(Eventually, there was rift in the party over the issue of slavery, and anti-slavery members of the Whig party, including Abraham Lincoln, exited the party and formed the Republican Party. As we can see, the parties must have switched again because it’s common knowledge that Republicans are actually the racist ones.)

Then the parties switched when the Democrats are on record as having mainly been the ones who owned slaves. Not all Democrats owned slaves, but 100% of slaves were owned by Democrats. Not a single Republican in history owned a slave. As we know, the parties switched again when Republicans repudiated slavery and Democrats defended it, leading to the civil war.

Then the parties switched again when a Democrat assassinated Republican Lincoln.

After the Civil War, the parties switched again during the Reconstruction Era, when Republicans attempted to pass a series of civil rights amendments in the late 1800s that would grant citizenship for freedmen. As evidence of the switch, the Democrats voted against giving former slaves citizenship, but the civil rights amendments passed anyway.

The parties switched again when the Democratic Party members founded the KKK as their military arm. Democrats then attempted to pass the first gun control law in order to keep blacks from having guns and retaliating against their former owners. A county wanted to make it illegal to possess firearms, unless you were on a horse. (Hmmm wonder who rode around on horses terrorizing people 🤔). Gun control has always been a noble cause touted by Democrats, but the racist reasons why the concept of gun control was dreamed up was a part of a party mentality switch, but not the actual party.

Somewhere around this time former slaves fought for gun rights for all, and the NRA was formed. The NRA switched parties too when they defended the right for blacks to arm themselves and white NRA members protected blacks from racist attackers.

The parties switched again when Republicans fought to desegregate schools and allow black children to attend school with white children, which Democrats fought fiercely against.

The nation saw a rash of black lynchings and bombings of black churches by the Democrats in the KKK and the parties switched again when Democrat Bull Conner tried to avoid prosecuting the racist bombers to get them off the hook. When blacks protested this injustice, the party-switched Democrat Bull Conner sicced dogs and turned the hose on them. He also gave police stand down orders when the KKK forewarned attacks on the freedom riders, who had switched parties.

The parties switched again when a Democratic Party president appointed the first and only KKK member to the Supreme Court.

The parties switched yet again when Democratic president FDR put Asians in racist internment camps.

Then parties switched again when the Democrats filibustered the passing of the second set of civil rights laws giving equal protection to minorities.

The parties switched when a Democrat assassinated MLK.

This brings us to modern times. The parties continue to switch all the time.

The parties switched when Democrats proposed racist policies like affirmative action to limit opportunities for certain racial groups in order to grant privilege to other racial groups.

The parties switched when the Islamic fundamentalist Omar Mateen and several other ISIS mass shooters aligned themselves with Democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

The parties switched again when liberal student groups in schools like UCLA and Berkeley call for segregated housing to make “separate but equal” housing quarters for black students. Actually this is a current ongoing thing, so the parties are right now in the middle of switching on this topic.

Parties always switched currently now that Democrats are rioting and violently protesting democracy.

The parties switched once more when the Democratic Nominee for President, an old white man, said “you’re not black” if you don’t vote for him, in a moment of clarity of how the Democratic Party sees their largest voter base: as property belonging to them.

So as you can see, because of Party switching, Democrats were always the ones who stood up against racism and wanted peace and unity while Republicans were always the racist and violent ones calling for division and discord.",2022-06-25 22:33:03

I read some of this the other day and had to stop myself from rolling my eyes.
The man has been in the position long enough, he's educated, well spoken but he's like the rest of them when it comes to ignoring the 800 gorilla in the room that's inches away from backhanding them to God.

The reason why people aren't healthier in America is the cost burden our for profit Healthcare system places on families and individuals.
People ration medication because it's too costly.
People skip going to the ER because it's too costly.
People refuse Ambulances because it's too costly.
People skip routine doctor visits because it's costly and usually leads to being prescribed an expensive medication or equally expensive testing or, God forbid, they try and send you to a specialist where it costs you $250.00 just to get in the door.

Everywhere else on earth provides Healthcare to people at much lower costs than what we here in the US get raped for every single day.
You want a truly shocking revelation?
Look up exactly how much money is made off of us for cancer treatment each year.
Then do yourself a favor and look up which of our politicians benefit financially from our Healthcare system as it stands.
Why cure anything when prolonging a disease is far more lucrative in the long term?
Hospitals using software to upcode medical procedures that are usually considered standard to being emergencies just so they can char 2,500 to 10,000 more than what they would normally change.
Our entire Healthcare system is designed to do nothing but be a financial drain on our lives, as if we didn't already have a big enough financial burden with cost of living and taxes.

As far as I'm concerned, Ms. Abrams has done more for the people of this country than ALL of the other crybaby, money grubbing politicians in Washington because she actually did something instead of like her colleagues who want to sit in chambers arguing with each other or streaming insta stories because they're bored and feel sucking up on social media for attention.

While the rest of Washington, President included, is busy shamelessly whoring itself before the media and its respective sycophants, Ms. Abrams is busy making life better for citizens.

Ms. Abrams has my utmost respect and she is the only politician I have said that about🙏🙌🙌🙌🙌",2021-12-08 21:23:56

Constant pain and dizziness for months.  In a sling the entire summer.

Canadian with cancer here. Found tumour in March 2019, first did watchful waiting for 2 months. May do ultrasound. Misdiagnosed. Follow up, do fine needle aspiration in June. Suspect cancer. In cancer centre by July, surgeon is on vacation, august the tumour is removed for full diagnosis. Grand rounds take place, September I’m put in radiation oncology care. They take their measurements and October it’s irradiated. 

Comes back. 

1 month post diagnostic surgery I’m making my chemo plan, 3 weeks after that I have my first dose. 

It’s been a bit less than a year. In total I paid $300 for parking. That’s it. And that was a tax write off.

My chemo bill alone would have been 500k. Hospitalization was easily 350k. Radiation 400k.",2021-11-10 15:01:10

Milk is still gonna be 6$ a gallon lol

Edit: I live in Seattle, it's 4-6$ a gallon here. Usually under 5 on sale only.

Edit edit edit: those of you saying it's cheaper than that maybe we're shopping at different stores for different milk. Idk but it is objectively more expensive now than it has been the whole 17 years I've lived here. So are all of my groceries. Also I buy whole milk cause I need vitamin D living in goth weather 9 months a year so maybe that's why. Still higher than I've seen. I have had to overhaul my entire grocery budget because some of my staples cost twice as much as they did last year. I have kept a relatively stable grocery budget for two people for a very, very long time. 

Jfc I didn't expect this post bitching about milk to blow up.  idk, argue with me if you want, inflation has affected my grocery shopping on everything. My 45-50$ weekly trips are now $60-75. It's not gonna go back down because it never has.

Last edit: I will no longer be responding to comments.

There has been much speculation as to who was actually to blame for the Capital Building being attacked yesterday. I have seen multiple people posting or commenting on social media that Antifa is to blame. I have come to the realization that the biggest Antifa member undermining the Republican Party is Trump. 

Just hear me out...

Trump was associated with the Democratic Party for years. He was friends with the Clintons but for his ingenious plan to work he had to play the long game. He had to separate himself from the people and the ideals he cares most about. 

Trump has worked tirelessly over the last 4 years to create doubt and separation. Slowly dismantling the Republican Party from the inside out, turning party member against party member. 

He has been in the forefront whenever there has been a call to violence. But he’s good. Never quite telling people to kill and pillage but with a gentle reminder, a nudge if you will, that they have second amendment rights. 

Now here comes QAnon - an anonymous post praising Donald Trump while blasting his counter parts. What better way to get conspiracy theorists on your side than with a conspiracy where you are their savior. His latest actions to bring down the Republican Party was his greatest of all. “Let’s walk down Pennsylvania Ave to the Capital Building and I will be by your side as “we” stop the steal!” he yelled from his podium. His final nail in the coffin that once was a party of law and order and for the people. 

What does Antifa supposedly want? They want chaos. They want to bring down “the man/big business.” Who is doing that better than anyone else? The man behind it all. The biggest Antifa member the world has ever known Donald J Trump. 

P.S. This is all complete bull shit. I wrote it as I sat at my kitchen table sipping my tea but it sure as hell makes ya think 🤔🤣 Wait never mind Trump is too self serving to actually give a shit about any cause.",2021-01-08 00:43:38

Then he said ""I wish her well""...

How does he constantly find new ways for the general public to distrust him more and more with every breath?

A politician should not be able to say he has well wishes for someone accused of child sex trafficking and still be in power. Do people think he is defending our rights to traffic children for sex and agree that he is still our representative?",2020-07-22 01:59:54

Dude... people are dying while you are patting your own back. 🤦🏼‍♀️

I started counting how many times he uses empty adjectives like “fenomenal, awesome, amazing, beautiful, wonderful” to talk about himself and his empty job, but lose the patience for this.

m8ng1f,"You do understand that these men/women are the reason you are able to enjoy any modicum of the ""Basic unalienable rights. These rights include, but are not limited to, ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" Not to mention the freedom of speech you know the one that let's you say ignorant things like ""veterans who stormed the Capitol to be stripped of benefits"". The real patriots who sacrificed there minds being reprogrammed and desensitized to the worst things imaginable. These true public servants who are lucky enough to come home and see the fruits of there works protecting the freedoms of not only the American people, but all free people. These Men/Women swore an oath to themselves,there countrymen,and there God (Whatever it may be) from the lowest Private to the highest General.

Oath of Enlistment

""I, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God."" (Title 10, US Code; Act of 5 May 1960 replacing the wording first adopted in 1789, with amendment effective 5 October 1962). 

Oath of Commissioned Officers

""I, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."" (Title 5 U.S. Code 3331, an individual, except the President, elected or appointed to an office of honor or profit in the civil service or uniformed services).


Why are the two oaths different and what does it mean that officers do not swear obedience to the president or higher ranking officers? This concept traces back to the intentions of the Founding Fathers who created our governing system with a separation of powers and series of checks and balances between the three branches. This ensures no single branch or person gains too much power and becomes corrupted. By swearing allegiance to a set of ideals and laws, our military is not bound by the orders of a single person, but are dedicated to the defense of the people and their way of life.

The inclusion of defense against domestic threats this oath points to the desire to keep intact something that is fragile and worth defending against internal attempts to break our union apart – to protect against insurrection or destruction from within. 

This was originally added during the secession of the south in the civil war 

Personally I think these men/women are defending there homeland against what they and a good portion of honest American citizens believe to be a threat to the Constitution, what it stands for, and for the people it protects.

It's all down to interpretation by the individual peoples of the United States of America 

But to each there own opinions are like assholes everybody has one and believe it or not the Constitution gives them that right, not to force it onto  you but to express that opinion.

We're all Americans when will we stop following the bullshit both major party's feed us through the news, propaganda, and silencing of factual information being reported to us the Citizens the real power behind the government.

Sadly most Americans are sheep 🐑 not because they take a side, can't truly participate in the voting on local or national issues, but because alot of us are just average joes/Janes working stiffs along for the ride living paycheck to paycheck slaves working unreasonable amounts of overtime to be pushed into a higher tax bracket to ultimately bring less home to feed our families.

The system is always going to be flawed but let's be honest with ourselves currently the system is broken and serving the few not the many not the American people.

So stay up-to-date on current affairs, how tax laws affect you more than the millionaire 1%, why aren't there term limits on all offices of government local and federal, why are the prison systems so over crowded (about 2,298,300 people are incarcerated out of a population of 324.2 million. This means that 0.7% of the population is imprisoned), more importantly how are our tax dollars spent and who is spending the money.

Defund the Police doesn't mean disband the Police force. why are our tax dollars being spent to militarize the local authorities. If that type of approach is necessary doesn't it fall to the National Guard to defend us citizens. Local cops don't need assault rifles in the trunk of there cruisers that's what S.W.A.T (special weapons and tactics) are trained for if its above there head and pay grades then let the Profesional trained soldiers do there job. 

Stay on top of what you vote on and pass into law the department of homeland security issues and enforces unlawful deportation warrants, the patriot act allows the United States government to violate your right to privacy and spy on American Citizens.

Whistle Blower are not treasonous they typically expose treasonous actions of the people running our country Edward Snowden fled his home his country and his family to expose the truth that were being treated the same as our nations enemies, the same as criminals each and every one of us. That man is a patriot and a hero to me. 

Stop taking there side, take up your side, the American peoples side the system today is stacked against us. 


Fix the system fix it before they fix us! Big brother doesn't always know best. And definitely has its own agenda to take power for itself  away from us citizens, to keep us blind from the real issues and holds back not only our country but the world.

Wake up America  

before its you on the executioners block distracting the masses from the real problems the real issues dive into the restless sea known as politics learn to swim or your going to drown.

Not every person was there to storm the gates most were there to protest (also protected and provided by the Constitution) 

I'm done ranting figure it out people wake up, learn to swim, think for yourselves.",2021-03-20 01:12:35

I don’t think people want things for free, but I do think we are talking about an advanced society where people are going without basic needs (healthcare) or cannot even begin to think about a life outside their current environment because continuing their education (college, tech school, etc.) isn’t an option. 

When did wanting better for ourselves become “freeloading”? Especially when we leave in a society in a country that can afford it. These things already exist mind you.

First of all none of what youre saying about Kennedy is confirmed, its mostly just a bunch of conspiracies since nobody knows what exactly happened.

Kennedy was a good a president, AOC and Hillary are right for praising him and his administration.

The 300k deaths pretty much 100% on Donald. He started off by calling it a hoax and then obstructed heavily until this very day. There is no person on the planet more responsible for this than him. And no, you don't need to start charging mask deniers for murder if you acknowledge Trump is the main reason why COVID is so out of hand in the US.

I cant say I'm too interested in more flimsy examples seeing as you led with comparing one of the best modern presidents to Trump. I'd prefer if you just acknowledged what I'm saying has truth instead of stretching for poor examples. 

Just think about it, think about the roots of America's problems right now. Pretty much all caused by Republicans 🤷‍♂️ Bush fucked the economy, Obama got it back working, Trump gets in office? Another avoidable recession happens. Most Republicans won't even admit that institutional racism exists.

It's like I said though, centrists might have a better shot at convincing America if they can come up with anything thats in the same galactic region in terms of wrongdoing in comparison to repubs. Apathetics have their work cut out for them though, America chose Biden in a landslide and apathy is being rebuked pretty hard in this election.",2020-12-10 18:42:32

I know there’s a loud minority of FAR RIGHT Trump supporters who think he’s our ever loving king, but I can assure you the rest of conservatives don’t really care who is president, namely because we know that we still control the senate, we have a majority of conservative Supreme Court justices, and we narrowed the democratic majority in the house.

On top of ALL of those things, we also know our military leaders (the good ones) won’t let any party (dem or republican) violate the constitution which they swore an oath to uphold.

Ergo, yes the same democrats that people love who say things like we should pack the court, ban guns, and create a list of Trump supporters and ban them from things for being trump supporters, to things like forcing Christians to believe in other religions (or say that religions should be banned);

Will have an incredibly hard time actually enforcing any of it because our military doesn’t answer to any man or woman or leader, they answer to one thing: the United States constitution.

I was in the military all though my 20’s, I served, fought, sweat, and bled with people of every color. We used to say in the army that everyone bleeds red. I firmly believe that, and I firmly believe that everyone is equal. I do believe the MSM is propagating racism. I’m not saying that I don’t believe it exists, but I don’t believe it’s on the level they’d like you to believe it is. I think that the last thing elementary school kids need to be focusing on is color. CRT has turned into labeling the white man as evil, and teaching the POC that they’ll never be looked at as equal. Unless you’re looking to raise a bunch of racist victims, I think it’s time we stop blaming the past, and start focusing on the here and now. All lives matter. We shouldn’t be teaching the next generation any different.

So taking 15 billion from someone worth 30 is not gonna change their life, and handed out $50 is not gonna change someone’s life at the bottom.

If you want to try to prove your claim, then you can always help the cause by voting for him.😏

Doesn’t really answer my question though, which at the end of the day is: How do you believe potential misinformation should be handled on social media sites? Should we take into account the potential impact and size of the audience of the statement? From a resource standpoint, for the same effort, it is more effective and efficient to fact check the widest spread messages rather than the locally spread.

Hypotheticals don’t get you any answers or action. We need to stop putting out noise and pick an actionable belief. I believe that fact checking should be done apolitically, but the statements that should be prioritized are ones that reach the most people and have the most potential impact. The President has the most powerful communication tool in the world potentially, so that tool needs to be scrutinized more than any other, regardless of party.

I don’t believe any one organization or human being has the right to fact check anyone or shut down any organization in anyway. Trump is a jack ass. We all know it. But unfortunately Twitter Facebook and so many organizations have vaguely hinted at banning anyone who has a different opinion than what they deem as “fact”. Information needs to flow freely no matter who it’s coming from even if it’s not proven factual. And if Trump is truly advocating for shutting down Twitter for fact checking him who knows maybe he’s like Nixon and that might need to happen. 🤷🏽‍♂️. Again I know Trump is a giant douche bag. But the fact that he struck down NAFTA tells me that man hates the New World order and hates anything Orwellian which is funny because if he wants to shut down Twitter it’s kind of an ironic situation.,2020-05-28 14:20:26

Leah McElrath 🏳️‍🌈 (@leahmcelrath): Most people do not seem to be mentally prepared for how much worse things can and likely will get over the next few months or for how fast things will happen once they do.

I despair about how better to help people open their minds to this reality.

Leah McElrath 🏳️‍🌈 (@leahmcelrath): We must both act as if the system is intact enough to enable us to remove a tyrant from power through the electoral process AND we must recognize the tyrant has no intention of respecting the electoral process or of participating in a peaceful transition of power.

It’s not easy.

Leah McElrath 🏳️‍🌈 (@leahmcelrath): When I talk about this, people tend to ask for solutions, “what should we do?!” and to get angry if I don’t respond with a bullet point list for how to maintain (the illusion of) control.

The first step is to understand the election is CRITICAL—but it will not be the end point.

Leah McElrath 🏳️‍🌈 (@leahmcelrath): For tonight, just try to sit and let your mind wrap around that much.

We are almost certainly NOT going to cast our ballots on election day and wake up the next morning to—uncontested—results.

That’s going to be traumatic in and of itself if you’re not prepared for it.

Leah McElrath 🏳️‍🌈 (@leahmcelrath): Not only are Trump and the GOP engaging in voter suppression and disenfranchisement—they are proactively planning to engage in “weeks-long legal fights in an array of states” after election day.

Hence their DESIRE for chaos.

Chaos = grounds to challenge.
https://twitter.com/marceelias/status/1294110762592612353

Leah McElrath 🏳️‍🌈 (@leahmcelrath): Trump and the GOP will do everything possible over the next six months to consolidate political power and put restrictions on civil liberties.

Whether the restrictions are legal or not is irrelevant. They’ll be in effect until there are court rulings otherwise, which takes time.

Leah McElrath 🏳️‍🌈 (@leahmcelrath): Trump has co-opted CBP and other federal forces to serve as his secret police and has seeded the police departments of various metropolitan areas with members of these various federal entities.

These entities are not trained in peacekeeping. They exist to do extrajudicial ops.

Leah McElrath 🏳️‍🌈 (@leahmcelrath): Trump and Barr have taken steps to expand the definition of “terrorists” to include people participating in protests and people “giving aid to” protesters.

Legal? Probably not. But those definitional expansions are nonetheless in effect and used by police and CBP with Americans.

Leah McElrath 🏳️‍🌈 (@leahmcelrath): I’m going to stop there for tonight. That’s enough for folks to take in for now.

So, yes, donate to Biden and Harris and help GOTV. Leave it ALL on the field for this election.

▶️**April 19, 2011**: In an interview with ABC News, Trump pledges to release his tax returns once President Obama releases his long-form birth certificate:

>”Maybe I'm going to do the tax returns when Obama does his birth certificate,"" Trump said in an interview with ABC. “I may tie my tax returns, **I'd love to give my tax returns, I may tie my tax returns into Obama's birth certificate.**""

▶️**April 27, 2011**: Obama releases long-form [birth certificate](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/04/27/president-obamas-long-form-birth-certificate).  No Trump tax returns.

▶️Also **April 27, 2011**: While contemplating a run in the 2012 Republican primary, Trump tells ABC News’ Michael Falcone that he will release his tax returns “at the appropriate time.”:

>”That’s something I would be thinking about doing anyway. That is certainly something I’d be thinking about doing anyway. But before I do anything I have to make the decision in June and **the first thing I’m going to be releasing will be financials**,” Trump said.  
>  
>Falcone asked again, will you fulfill that pledge that you made where you said I’m going to tie the birth certificate to my tax records?  
>  
>“Yeah, at the appropriate time,” Trump responded.  
>  
>“So you’ll do it?”  
>  
>“**Yeah, at the appropriate time I’m going to do it**,” Trump told him.

▶️**January 18, 2012**: On Fox News, Trump says Mitt Romney should release his tax returns:

>GRETA VAN SUSTEREN: Has Governor Romney been boxed on this tax return thing, and if he called you up tonight and said, Donald, ‘What should I do about tax return thing, should I release them or not?’  
>  
>TRUMP: I think first answer would have been good. It should have been delivered a certain way. **But April 1st historically is the time that everybody gives them**.

▶️**January 30, 2012**: Again commenting on Romney’s campaign, Trump tells Fox News that releasing your tax returns is “a great thing.”:

>BRIAN KILMEADE: When you see some of the analysis on Mitt Romney’s tax records, would that be a repellent for you, for Donald Trump to reveal everything?  
>  
>TRUMP: **I actually think that it’s a great thing when you can show that you’ve been successful, and that you’ve made a lot of money, that you’ve employed a lot of people. I actually think that it’s a positive**.”

▶️**May 2014**: Trump says that if he runs for office, he will “absolutely” release his tax returns, in an interview with Ireland’s TV3:

>COLETTE FITZPATRICK: You questioned his \[Obama’s\] citizenship during his campaign, and you said afterwards if he produced that long-form birth certificate, you’d produce your tax returns. But you didn’t do it, did you?  
>  
>TRUMP: Well I don’t know, did he do it? **And if I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that**.

▶️**February 25, 2015**: Trump tells conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that he has “no objection” to releasing his tax returns:

>HUGH HEWITT: Would you release tax returns, though?  
>  
>TRUMP: **I would release tax returns**, and I would also explain to people that as a person that’s looking to make money, you know, I’m in the business of making money until I do this. And if I won, I would make money for our country. \[…\] So the answer is yeah, I would do it. \[…\]  
>  
>HEWITT: How many years back would you go on the day you announce? Three? Five?  
>  
>TRUMP: Oh, I don’t know. I mean, I actually have not even thought of that, but **I would certainly show tax returns if it was necessary**.

▶️**October 4, 2015**: On ABC’s This Week, Trump says he will release his tax returns once Hillary Clinton releases her emails:

>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Getting any closer to releasing your tax returns?  
>  
>TRUMP: Well, I’m thinking about it. **I’m thinking about maybe when we find out the true story on Hillary’s emails**. You know, I’ve been saying that for a while, let’s find out the true stories.  
>  
>STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, that’s been your line, but she’s been putting some out.  
>  
>TRUMP: **But you know what? I’m very honest with my tax returns**.

▶️**January 24, 2016**: On NBC’s Meet the Press, Trump says that his campaign is “working on” releasing his tax returns:

>CHUCK TODD: Will you release any of your tax returns for the public to scrutinize?  
>  
>DONALD TRUMP: Well, we’re working on that now. **I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we’ll be working that over in the next period of time**, Chuck. Absolutely.  
>  
>...  
>  
>TRUMP: I pay, it’s a little tax. And I say it. And the reporters said, “That’s the most refreshing answer I’ve ever heard on taxes,” because everyone tries to build it up \[…\] **We’re working on it right now, and at the appropriate time, you’ll be very satisfied.**

▶️**February 10, 2016**: Trump tells NBC News that he will release his tax returns over the next few months:

>MATT LAUER: Real quickly. When are you going to release your tax returns?  
>  
>TRUMP: **Probably over the next few months**. They’re being worked on now.

▶️**February 19, 2016**: IRS says Trump can release tax returns, regardless of audit.

▶️**Rest of 2016 - 2019**: 'Can’t, audits.'

And now it’s going all the way to the Supreme Court.  8 years of him claiming he'd release them, and yet he's fighting tooth and nail to keep them concealed.  I'm beginning to think this Trump fellow isn't entirely truthful.",2020-02-20 05:46:30

The good news is that with only a 12% increase needed it stands to be that they will most likely far exceed the 100 million goal which I guess sets up the next headline praising how through seemingly insurmountable odds they succeeded. 🙄 I am optimistic though, I believe we are in the slowest part of the vaccine roll out.

He’s from coal country so this is common knowledge. What I find more interesting is the second largest contributor, Ryan LLC. Who or what is [Ryan LLC](https://www.ryan.com)? Their web site announces in 72pt type:

lrkzw5,"> Texas Senator Ted Cruz's approval rating took a major hit following last week's Cancun trip fiasco, according to a Yahoo/YouGov poll. The poll, released Wednesday, found that 24 percent of voters approve of the Republican senator's job performance, while 49 percent disapprove.

> The poll was conducted from February 20 to 22 following the severe winter weather conditions that left many Texas residents without power or water. The poll, which surveyed over 1,500 adults across the U.S., has a 2.9 point margin of error.

> Among Republicans, Cruz's approval rating sits at 53 percent, a 23-point decrease from his January rating in a Morning Consult poll. In that survey, conducted from January 9 to 18, 76 percent of Texas Republicans supported him.

Would be interested to see what Texas Republicans think of him, as I imagine it might be even lower. Hardly any of his supporters like Ted Cruz; they just tolerate him because he’s a Republican.

They **INDICATED** him?

That isn't as bad as *designating* him, but at most he should have just been *specified.*

What now? Is Trump to be *attested* by the *Poe Lease?*

Seriously, Trump misspelling ""indictment"" in his ""I got indicted"" meltdown is very on brand. 

Motherficker misspelled ""honored"" in his [first Tweet as President](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/01/trump-deletes-tweet-after-writing-he-is-honered-to-serve.html)

His minders [misspelled ""Nobel""](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-team-misspells-nobel-in-campaign-ad-celebrating-meaningless-peace-prize-nomination)

We always feared a fascist demagogue, but we didn't expect him to be quite this dim.

Carlson isn’t talking about the infinitesimal amount of fraud that is expected to happen each election. He’s, *once again*, implying that there was widespread fraud perpetrated by Democrats.

It was this cap for private insurance that was voted down by Republican's in the Senate, but the Medicare portion didn't get touched (because the parlimentarian ruled that it could only apply to Medicare and not private insurance because it doesn't effect the budget directly) and not because Republicans played any useful role.

I do hope Schumer brings up the standalone bill for private insurance as he says he will since the other side has complained about ""the rules"". Which of course is bullshit... But I hope he makes them put their money where their mouth is and we get it passed.

The Medicare cap at $2k per year, even though it starts in 2025, should be something Dems yell about every single time they get in front of a microphone.

Edit: Ok. I didn't make the point that Republican's aren't for capping costs of insulin regardless of it being within private or public healthcare clear enough for some of you. I made a change above to reflect that.

Republican's have offered nothing useful in terms of healthcare proposals for a few decades now. I know this one quite well but I might gloss over this point a bit too much because I forget that the problem with common knowledge is that it isn't always very common.👌",2022-08-16 22:07:07

Which is 675-1200$ in an hour. And sure there are support systems techs, whatever but people with more important roles make more money anyways. And won't be affected. Even a simple truck driver gets more money. So to correct their low income employees won't have a huge impact due to the fact that relatively speaking it's not that big of a change.

ke8hdn,"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”


Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.",2020-12-16 19:10:34

""They will spend millions of dollars to take $300 a [week] away from you and your family, to force you to work for them for pennies,"" she added. ""Their greed has no bounds.""

n7rntq,"Yeah... It just kind of sucks that obviously the CEO is not 'flipping his own burgers', actually there are people out here working 24 hr shifts and shit to keep the restaurants open

This week I worked 8am-2pm, came back at 9pm-5am, then came back at 3pm-midnight

Oh, and by the way, I was questioned about a guest complaint that I was 'rude' when I agreed to pick up that nightmarish punishment of a shift outside of my availability to help them out.*

I said, yeah I was probably pretty grumpy I worked instead of sleeping and the management just stared at me. Then I walked away

*actually really to help my co worker who doesn't have the cushy availability that I do and is regularly working whole days straight

I don't blame workers for anything I just don't think people outside of the industry understand remotely what is happening and they still treat us like everything is normal and yeah I was rude to ppl I wanted to burn the place to the ground after no sleep especially when they disrespect me first 🙄",2021-05-09 02:48:26

What left wing idiot don’t get is that those $300 boosts are pure inflation and debt. Look at gas prices, construction materials, food and others, were in deep trouble, unemployment must stop.",2021-05-08 19:24:43

n7rntq,"I joined a company part time, they’re expanding the business so part of my job is to recruit and hire. My CEO was insistent on the pay being $8 an hour less than industry minimum standard. So 2 months later and I can’t find anyone. Lol, this man has no idea why. We’re getting lots of applicants. None of them meet requirements. They all have a bachelors degree. The position (by law) requires a masters. But since he’s seeing dozens of applications he is not understanding why we’re not getting anyone. Even when we do get people applying, when I reach out, no responses. He decides he’s going to call them himself. Because I must be doing something wrong 🙄. Finally I reach someone and she tells me she’s being offered the industry minimum at another agency and he finally agrees to raise what he’s willing to pay. I just don’t understand how people think. Like who did he think was going to work for that fee? And I may have convinced some of my former employees to come over, they’re miserable since I left, but I was never going to put them in a situation where their work wasn’t valued. It makes no sense to me. 

At the same time at a previous place of work I regularly see indeed posts. They’ve been through 7-8 people in the past 3 years. They’re now offering twice what I was making. Plus two assistants! Lol.

n7rntq,"Lol I do t have an arm infection 😌 and yes I have, and if you're poor it doesnt cost really anything to move. A bunch of blankets from a thrift store makes a comfy mattress, and a bus pass is fairly cheap. Greyhound is also incredibly inexpensive to travel across country.

I think people take comfort into consideration too much in their youth. I had no problem walking 4 miles in 100+ heat to get myself to work after riding a bus for 3 hours each day in my early 20s to work.

I also wouldnt have any issue picking up my life and moving and sleeping on the floor of a cheap apartment and buying some thrift store stuff to find a better opportunity in another city. This is what people do. In most states one can survive on just under $900 a month if budget properly. You budget for 4-6 years and save enough money to live for a year or so in case of emergency and you start pursuing bigger better things.

Dont buy coffee, dont eat fast food, dont own a car, dont travel, dont do anything beyond the required for living. Shop at big lots or whatever dollar store you have and buy cheap decent clothing at a thrift store. Instead of going out you go to community college or educate yourself in a better paying skill. 

It's really that simple, the problem is people will say fuck that, I'm not living like that. But they turn 45 and wish they spent 4 years in their youth bettering their life instead of fucking around only to wake up at 45 in the same position with time running out.",2021-05-08 23:49:30

Dear REMOVED,

📷

I want to provide you some very important information. I’m a committee member within the Liberal Party of Canada.

I sit within several committee groups but the information I am providing is originating from the Strategic Planning committee (which is steered by the PMO).

I need to start off by saying that I’m not happy doing this but I have to. As a Canadian and more importantly as a parent who wants a better future not only for my children but for other children as well.

The other reason I am doing this is because roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals. They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes.

**The road map and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows:**

– Phase in secondary lock down restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward. Expected by November 2020.

– [Rush the acquisition](https://humansarefree.com/2020/10/canadian-government-erecting-a-network-of-covid-detainment-camps.html) of (or [construction of) isolation facilities across every province and territory](https://humansarefree.com/2020/10/politician-warns-trudeau-govt-plans-to-build-covid-quarantine-isolation-camps-across-canada.html). Expected by December 2020.

**– Daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves. Expected by end of November 2020.**

**– Complete and total secondary lock down (much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions). Expected by end of December 2020 – early January 2021.**

– Reform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program. Expected by Q1 2021.

– Projected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection. Expected by February 2021.

– Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical care facilities capacity. Expected Q1 – Q2 2021.

**– Enhanced lock down restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed (including inter-province and inter-city). Expected Q2 2021.**

**– Transitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program. Expected mid Q2 2021.**

– Projected supply chain break downs, inventory shortages, large economic instability. Expected late Q2 2021.

– Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. [Restrict travel and movement](https://humansarefree.com/2020/08/illuminati-insider-1969-travel-very-restricted.html). Provide logistical support to the area. Expected by Q3 2021.

Along with that provided road map the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor.

One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians. What we were told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on a international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief.

This is how it works:

**The federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program.**

**In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever.**

**The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lock down (through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada’s HealthPass).**

Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told “the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details”.

Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling.

Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate.

When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely.

And that over a short period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities.

Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized.

So as you can imagine after hearing all of this it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond anything I’ve ever witnessed before.

In the end it was implied by the PMO that the whole agenda will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not. That it wont just be Canada but in fact all nations will have similar roadmaps and agendas.

That we need to take advantage of the situations before us to promote change on a grander scale for the betterment of everyone.

The members who were opposed and ones who brought up key issues that would arise from such a thing were completely ignored.

Our opinions and concerns were ignored. We were simply told to just do it.

All I know is that I don’t like it and I think its going to place Canadians into a dark future.

kxb8q3,"> Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump's eldest daughter, and her husband Jared Kushner, a top aide to the president, have spent about $100,000 on bathroom accommodations for their Secret Service detail after prohibiting the agents from using the bathrooms in their Washington mansion, The Washington Post reported Thursday. 

> Law enforcement officials told The Post that the president's daughter and son-in-law barred the Secret Service from using their 6.5 bathrooms when they first moved into their home in DC's wealthy Kalorama neighborhood in 2017. Instead, they offered the agents a porta-potty outside on the sidewalk.

> But after multiple neighbors complained about the porta-potty, the agents were forced to relieve themselves at a bathroom in former President Barack Obama's garage nearby, at the vice president's compound a mile up Massachusetts avenue, and at businesses in the area. 

> Finally, in September 2017, the federal government began renting a $3,000-a-month studio apartment across the street from the Trump-Kushner residence for the agents' bathroom needs.

They were so obvious and so predictable I knew they were trying to stall and not call out states for  President Trump, when he was clearly winning because it would’ve been over for Joe. So the fake news kept him locked and steady at 214. Laughable they expect us to believe he lost and underperformed when he won the senate and gained new seats in the House? Sure. If many of you guys are so sure Joe won why are you guys against finding out the truth and letting the process take place? Aren’t you guys concerned about election integrity? Because I am. Democrats have been stealing elections for decades but they over played their hand this time. I don’t think they’re going to be able to recover from this along with their media buddies.

They (the Dems obviously) used Covid as an excuse to get everyone to vote by mail and change our voting laws while they cried “Covid” on TV and Twitter. It’s super obvious what they were doing. That’s why 100,000+ votes magically appeared for Joe in the middle in the night in states President Trump was winning? Interesting. I don’t buy it. Why was the media so quick to call states for Biden and not Trump? Why were they in a rush to name the next President when the election was still alive and states weren’t done counting votes? I don’t understand how some people can’t see there’s something shady going on. Why would you want an illegitimate President? Just to claim the title of “President” while ignoring the massive irregularities? And to finish if some Dems cared so much about Covid and not spreading it, why were some of Biden’s supporters celebrating without masks on the street and so close together?
