UK : look we have a great new deal, want to sign it?

Europe: Nah Dog, we good over here.

UK : but it’s a goo...

Europe : NO!


Imagine someone sells you a house for a 1000 euros, you buy and sign the contract, then that seller starts adding zeros to that signed contract, now you owe a billion euros. That’s what’s happening.

A lot of people feel the left has grown too accustomed to cancel culture and destroying people’s lives who don’t hold their exact beliefs and apply empathy regularly to their exact ideals and priorities.

People forget that you’re allowed to be an asshole. You’re allowed to be morally bankrupt. You’re allowed to believe things that suck and are wrong. As long as you don’t hurt anyone. Liberty is important.

Muslims need to stop projecting their shit on non muslims and accept the fact that people can have different views on shit. If you are religious, it should be seen as a relationship between YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND GOD ONLY. NO THIRD PARTY SHOULD BE INVOLVED HERE WHATSOEVER!

Religion is great on an individual lvl but the moment it starts organizing on a bigger scale , it turns into just another mafia organization...

if it wasn't clear yet, eventhough this specifically states islam, this view is regarding ALL religions.

You guys seriously revolutionized video playback by democratizing it. I am at a place where I am on the right side of the law and pay for everything through official stores these days. However there are still movies floating around that you simply cannot get digitally. 

Of every third party program that was on my computer in 2007 the only one that still remains is VLC.

Ukraine currently isn’t in *any* formal military alliance. There is literally no country other than Ukraine whose military force has already volunteered to fight for Ukraine.

[Its Coming Home. This will be a breeze, mark my words. Germany are in a weak situation currently. We play at home and will enjoy a confident and stellar performance, expecting no less than a 3-0 win for us to crush their hopes of advancing into Quarter Finals. Our atmosphere is PERFECT, the best in Europe we are not matched by any fangroup I can think of, we haven't lost to other British Teams' ultras in 20 years. Our mental strength is the greatest it has ever been - from 50 years of hurt to this wonderful squad bombing down the pitch with Sterling opening up the defense like Moses parted the sea. Tuesday will be a day to be remembered, proud to be a England fan and most of all laughing at the other jealous fans jealous at our recent success! Fear us, Fear England, Fear the power.

jv1b4o,"And of course chasing the grey vote. It's a well accepted political Truth™ that Young People Don't Vote. In a proportional system some parties would eventually move in to grab the youth vote, engaging with the younger voters by backing younger candidates. It would be safe for them to do so because being the biggest party isn't the only way to gain any influence. As these parties become gradually more successful, they will normalize the practice of pushing forward candidates who weren't around when Prometheus stole fire from the gods.

If the system is based on FPTP, however, then abandoning the old electorate in favor of the younger people is an enormous risk that they are not willing to take. Old people tend to be incredibly ageist, they frequently see anyone significantly younger than themselves as being unable to lead so as long as the parties are all trying to grab the biggest portion of the 50+ voters, younger candidates will be the anomaly and not the rule.

Maybe when the boomers and boomer-analog generations die out, the parties are going to start pushing millennial candidates first instead of X-ers, simply because gen-X and analogous generations have much smaller numbers so they are relatively safe to skip. But since zoomers and gen-alpha are going to be fairly small in the developed countries (zoomers simply because their parents are a less populous generation, gen-alpha because millennials can't afford them) this will lead to the same situation 30-40 years down the line when us '80s kids are going to be the new grey vote. (That is, if we're still around in 30-40 years and still get to vote.)",2020-11-16 09:07:09

I would not say that ""protecting"" someone with a compromised immune system or who is over 80 years old is worth ALL of society giving up their lives. Like others have said, some people are not ok with all of humanity merely ""surviving."" Some of us still want to live. Because you know, it's called ""life.""

ve5c55,"Not to mention the vast majority of buildings, houses, apartments, aren't set up to make life bearable at 35+ C in Germany. Almost no private residence has AC. These temperatures have been hitting us *fast* over the past couple of years.

For my family, in a building from 1907, 35-40C outside means having to have a plan for when to open windows and let any air into the rooms at all (that is, at NIGHT, never during the day), and hanging towels over the windows during the day because regular curtains let too much hot sunshine in unless you have those fancy expensive high tech blinds that are aluminium on one side and are able to block out heat. Then there's other small things like not being able to step on your own balcony with bare feet (or socks) when it's been 30+ outside for a few hours, its floor just gets too hot.

We just kinda shower 3 times per day and lay around apathetically next to a fan a lot when it's THAT hot outside. I can't see the average German getting used to, let's say, a full 3 weeks of 35-40C every summer. Or even hotter, god forbid 🤞",2022-06-17 09:44:18

It just that I can know about it sooner and from places I never heard or cared about( I mean out of ignorance or apathy, not because I don't like those places). Technology has given a speaker phone to a small but very vocal amd dogmatic group of people.  So whereas those voices were muffled or hidden 8n the past. We hear and see them clear as day. And they prey on the disadvantaged and less educated.  Just like how the Taliban operated with such success in Afghanistan 🇦🇫 . The Putinist filth and CCP garbage know this well. They really have a big role in the current divisions within the 🇺🇸 USA. Sure they existed before. But well targeted propaganda took advantage of this, exploited it with such efficeny and accuracy. Qanon  etc.... that's all from weaponized information. Plus it's no secret the Putinists and CCP trash fund these divisive groups. From far right and far left extremists.

And in case anyone missed it there's tons of posts regarding yesterday's mass atrocity and terrorist attack upon civilians in Dnipro. And Russians and pro russians on Telegram are apparently cheering about this. 🤬  No excuse and no justification and no opinions. It's flat out WRONG AND ABHORRENT and even worse people are cheering this.  Again Russia is nazi Germany fucking cheering this on. Disgusting.  Appeasers and pro russians love to make up war crimes and cry wAr cRimE if a Russian says Slava Ukraine yet this is what Russians do and support - terrorism. Give me a break.

Oh and let's not forget that Russians are willing to use other people from other countries TO FIGHT THEIR WAR.  They are willing to sacrifice innocent Belarusians 👏 TO GO FIGHT THEIR WAR 👏.  White moscovites  get spared that way and get to continue on being genocidal war mongerers bc they get to expend Belarussians.  Fabulous country.

Oh and look now Serbians could be participating in the genocide. Double bad.  Doesn't help the serb image and also again, Russia is willing to throw in people from other countries in place of Russians.  What a demented shit show omg.  Russians want this war but go out recruiting suckers from other countries. 🙄  We keep hearing how Russia has endless men to send to this war ...... yet....... they look to send people from other countries.  Huge sign of weakness and that pootin is scared to send his own.  Doesn't sound like his war is very popular if he has to use Belarusians and Serbs.  All those ruskies are willing to support the war but not enough to fight it.  Who would have thunk it.

The desperation, weakness, shamelessness, and cowardice of Russia and Russians is limitless, lol.

Why do all recognize the European crimes against other native ethnicities, but no one cares to say anything about the Turkic crimes to native people of Anatolia and Caucasus, Turkic colonizers are responsible for much more then the stealing of Armenian, Greek, Arabic, Persian and Roman history they are also responsible for wiping Germanic Goths from Crimea and the Black Sea, those were the same Goths who won over Rome, Turkic colonizers are responsible for making Caucasus, the Balkans and the Eastern Europe into the war ridden place Turkic crimes have to be acknowledged and punished, since if we don’t the next are Syrians, Greek NATIVE Cypriotes, Kurds and other minorities in Turkey no one has ever heard of, Armenians have lived in the region for 4700 years and it will stay that way, strong Hayastan, we are gonna bring Turkey to justice why was NAZI Germany brought to justice but Turkey has not imagine if Germany said “Hitler was great he did a lot for our strong white nation, and all the people who were killed under his rule were just victims of war not a genocide”

Needless to mention that the Armenian genocide was a huge fail and it only resulted in Armenian communities becoming global and stronger Armenians are thriving Turkey failed 🇦🇲❤️",2020-07-30 19:20:22

Obviously you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. And Turkey is not trying to expand its borders, it's trying to create a place for some of the 5 million ish (world's largest refugee population in one country - yeah, the evil Turks are among the only ones who take in the masses of the world these days - it's not all Syrians btw), refugees to return to their own state. Turkey has spend well over 40Bn$ on this from its own treasury, with very little help, despite not being the cause of the refugee crisis. The people who cause it aren't lifting a finger to help. 40Bn might not sound like a lot to you, but for Turkey, that's an ENORMOUS amount of money. And Turkey is spending more billions in Northern Syria, trying to rebuild enough of a place for people to have somewhere to live when they return (again with no help from any of the people turning the place into dust (U.S., Russia, Assad).",2020-07-01 04:41:57

I would like to thank you for reading about Ataturk and understanding the core values of real Turkey.

I do follow Ataturk’s vision, and believe that we will restore our country’s core values again but I still cannot understand how a western country could cooperate with a terrorist organization.

This is *sort of* true still. There are other peoples who live similar to Romani, who are not Romani, but are called ""gypsies"". Irish and British travelers, for example, are distinct from Romani but live similarly, and historically were also called or associated with ""gypsies"". Scandinavian travelers are another group with the same history of treatment. There are also some groups who are ethnically related to Romani, but are still distinct.

It sounds like nonsense.

Your options to rationalize this are dwindling if this the best analogy you can come up with.

>People don't criticise Romani for being Romani. 

Then you haven't read anything.

>They criticise them for the way that they live, that's why you see every traveller culture receive exactly the same types of abuse. It's not racism. It's cultural.

I wasn't born yesterday. I heard this all before with any other prejudiced ethnic minorities... This is dehumanizing humans 101.

>The argument is made because you've never actually seen what an area looks like when a traveller community decides to move somewhere.

No need to repeat yourself, I already gave you a rebuttal for this. And here it is: I have never been to Auschwitz, I don't have to immerse myself in nazi society to understand the horror of it.

People dislike travellers because of the actions of travellers. Not their race, nor their ethnicity. Their actions.

>Racism is never justified. It also doesn't solve anything. Find another solution.

And as I have just shown you if you were capable of logical reasoning, is not racism.

1+9=10 × 6 = 60 × 10 = 600        
  
_______________________________f  z z i  e

So only those numbers are left: 6 2 6 9 5

I thought this is the end and there is no 66 hidden... but THEN! I realized that  i  is not only a letter, but also an imaginary number!! And if you square i, you get -1!

So 6×9=54 +6=60 +5=65 +2=67 -1= 66 + 600

Then when they try to call the gas repairman, you hang up the phone. Only to then complain you don't have your fish yet.

I'm talking about actual Nazis. You can slice it however you want to find some special circumstance where Nazism is okay for you. That's fine. I abhor it in any fashion though. Russia's lies don't have any weight what so ever. So why repeat them as some sort of gotcha? 

Remember a few years ago when there were those fine looking white men marching and chanting blood and soil? Those people should have been exterminated with extreme prejudice immediately. I have 0 empathy for Nazis. Those people deserved to be shot first and questioned second. I won't waste my time conversing or converting a Nazi ever. And neither should you. That entire ideology should be exterminated from the planet. If you feel empathy for a Nazi read a history book.

Israel isn't trying to exterminate Nazis. Israel has a genocide against Palestinians. It's different. It's awful and i wish it wasn't happening. However israels current genocide doesn't have anything to do with Nazism. 👍",2024-03-09 21:57:24

Also, Iran exports their own cars to a few countries. Their car industry has been developed with assistance from French car manufacturers. 

They also 'export' a lot of scientific and academic work. And Iran is one of 10 or so countries to 'export' a satellite into space. 

Iranian immigrants like myself have exported a lot if contributions (CEOs/Founders) to 'high tech' Silicon Valley companies like Uber, eBay, Dropbox, Tinder and etc. 

[Here's](https://www.fastcompany.com/90245389/dara-khosrowshahi-and-37-other-iranians-who-power-silicon-valley) a little more on that. So it's a bit disrespectful to characterize the Iranian diaspora or Iran's exports as merely nothing but junkies and cats.

What requirements are you talking about? 

Ukraine is going full speed with technical and organisational requirements. Political requirements will follow

Once again. You are not talking about if you are up to that idea or not. You're talking like the decision is already made not to accept Ukraine in NATO which is a lie and contradicts the official position of alliance (open doors policy)

We know that the West fears WWIII

But you better stop talking like Ukraine doesn't deserve NATO membership. It is simply immoral take 

P.S. The requirements not fulfilled now doesn't mean they won't be fulfilled soon + doesn't mean Ukraine doesn't deserve NATO membership per se

For instance there’s this convenience store with a parking lot at a corner of an intersection, where evidently many people cut through to skip a red light.

In the update, the parking lot is now registered [as a road](https://minkara.carview.co.jp/image.aspx?src=https%3a%2f%2fcdn.snsimg.carview.co.jp%2fminkara%2fuserstorage%2f000%2f048%2f486%2f289%2f51fe91453b.jpg?ct=46a398b13282), so presumably if Waymo were to test in Japan cars would cut through the parking lot without hesitation...

Sure. But OPs post was more about building better so they don't break easily. And you can engineer better to make things easy to fix, too, instead of having to disassemble the whole thing to get to a screw to change out a fuse.

And if we really wanted to be sustainable we'd have to factor in the cost of recycling the materials for similar reuse, and suddenly our throw-away culture would be much more expensive.

Maybe it's just me, but I hate to throw out all the food, do my research on buying a new one, hunt for good prices, make sure they will carry the thing up to the fifth floor and take the old one with them, make sure the new one fits and move around furniture to make room, buy all new food to restock everything and be upset about the weird noises the new one makes 😂",2021-12-18 14:49:00

To me that shows that we valued and respected our interwar alliances way more than the alliance with Germany in which we were forced into because of the Soviet aggression against us, an alliance in which we were forced to give up Northern Transylvania and Southern Dobruja as well.

Part of our school education is a very detailed analysis of WW2 and all the horrors and crimes we brought to the World, so they managed pretty well to get us all scared like hell of Germany being involved in another war.

Plus all the rumours of the still intact remnants of ww2, that can convert germanys economy into producing war machinery pretty fast makes me feel like I am living in a ww3 teaser at the moment.
Tho I guess it would end pretty fast with tons of nuclear weapons being used on all sides.

Not putting everyone who doesn't identify as progressive in the same box and vice versa.

I never said this. 

> You’re describing snowflakes

I'm not. 

>who can’t get over the fact that others disagree with them.

You're the one that's getting all riled up about people who don't agree with you. Those (((conservatives))).

>They’re not being oppressed, they’re not worrying about being randomly shot down in the streets, and please tell me which rights of theirs have been taken away underneath a Democrat. 

And you're telling me all this. Why? What does that have to do with anything?

>And hate what the progressive side is doing? Get the fuck over it. People aren’t always going to agree, and if it doesn’t have a goddamn thing to do with you then fuck off and that goes for everyone. 

Well, not for you it seems. 

>Most conservatives nowadays are a bunch of crybaby snowflakes,

This the same thing conservatives say about progressives.

>I seriously can’t believe you defended conservatives with an argument of treating them like snowflakes so they don’t act up. For fuck sake.

No. You're just unable to understand opinions that are not yours. 

I haven't defended conservatives. I just tried to add some nuance that you're too willfully blind to see.

Your partisanism completely blinds you. People like you, regardless of political sides, are why modern politics are so fucked. All this radicalism, name calling, getting so riled up about what you think the other person has said without stopping for a second to try to understand what they've actually said... it only breeds polarization and conflict. 

But I know since this isn't “conservatives bad”™, it's all going to get lost on you. So, I won't be taking part of this any longer as it would be pointless.",2021-01-18 16:03:10

Basaev claimed that his plans were unknown to Dudaev, and that he acted on his own. Never the less, he was awarded by Dudaev for his actions in Budyonnovsk.

This is provocative and I'm not going to get into this with you more than this: it is rarely highlighted that Russians who lived in Chechnya in the early nineties were subject to horrific oppression by the chechens. In the lead up to the first chechen war, beatings, murders and kidnappings were commonplace.

y0khfs,"> Dudayev was secular as a result of his soviet upbringing.

Yeah, now that's stupid and not knowing anything about the Chechens.

Dudayev and any Chechen of that age had their upbringing in Siberia, as Stalin had death-marched the entire nation. In return, they resisted culturally, lol. Sufi traditions and anything had been reserved, not by but against Soviet authorities at that time. 

It wasn't Soviet upbringing but Chechens themselves being fairly new converts to Islam that only had Sufi roots and a heterodox Caucasian kind of Islam where the religion touches barely anything but religious practices, funerals and marriages.

> So he had to learn Islam in the 90s.

Lol, that's even dumber. Yeah, a kid deported to Siberia learnt about his religion in the 1990s. He already knew, and as nearly all Chechens. But, aside from mufti Kadyrov maybe, he cared only about funerals and Sufi chants like all other Chechens.

> Yes, you are speaking of the Budyonnovsk hostage situation. Basaev's band of terrorists took about 600 people hostage (english wiki states numbers as high as 2500). About 140 of them died. It wasn't a military hospital, just a regular regional hospital full of patients and staff.

Basaev was en route to Moscow, he got trapped. And Basaev was a rogue element, gone mad with Russian brutality, while what he did was fairly light compared to Russian terror by then. The hostages also lost their lives due to stupid Russian Army operations killing them. What he demanded was also simple: ceasefire and end to Russian terror.

> This is provocative and I'm not going to get into this with you more than this: it is rarely highlighted that Russians who lived in Chechnya in the early nineties were subject to horrific oppression by the chechens.

That's some stupid argument as well. Many Russians in Chechnya were literal settlers who took over Chechen houses and lands when Stalin genocided them. When they returned, those some Russian settlers protested, organised pogroms and kept away Chechens from anywhere, alongside still keeping their properties.

Yet, by the 1990s, the tensions were at their lowest. Only with Cossacks demanding Northern Chechnya for Russia and whatnot, things got up. But the only real terror Russians faced was by literal criminal gangs, most of which were funded and guided by Russia to weaken and even fight with Dudayev, kidnapping people - and doing so for Russians more as unlike Chechens, they lacked the extended families that may bite back.

> In the lead up to the first chechen war, beatings, murders and kidnappings were commonplace.

Lol, no. First Chechen War was led by first Russia trying a civil war with those criminals also targeting Russians, and a failed coup. When the coup had failed and Russian units were also arrested, Yeltsin unleashed the war in Chechnya.

> Maskhadov, who was democratically elected (as if it matters lol), adopted Sharia Law in Chechnya and pronounced an Islamic State. Just like the boogeyman of ISIS/L that has frightened westerners!

Maskhadov was a secular Sufi. And he had to do that to both appease and cleanse out Islamist elements that he also offered Russia to root them out several times, including the Islamic Peacekeeping Brigade incident. In return, Russia did nothing but in the end, invaded Chechnya instead and put the only Chechen Islamic figure in charge.

Salafis in Chechnya were all a small number of converts, lol. Russia had and still has more extremists of any kind, and it'd be totally stupid to cheer for a state terror and total occupation of Russia according that. 

> They had slave trade

Any place in Russia that had authorities weakened had slave trade. Moscow also had it. Heck, Moscow still has it, as well as middle-of-nowhere Russia. There are NGOs trying to stop it. It had nothing to do with anything but authorities being weakened and post-Soviet times - and the authorities were weakened by Russia. Chechnya instead, never had had slavery for the time known, while Russians had tons. Congrats on importing some of the terrible practices to there for a little while then?

> Again, it is absolutely abhorrent and disgusting seeing that redditors rehabilitate terrorists just because ""MuH RuSsiA"". 🤮

Highlights being invasions of Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Afghanistan you left after 20 years of occupation, last year. You're still in Syria. Stealing stuff.

> We've never tried to straight up take over another country the way Russia does. 

Except for that time you colonized the Philippines. But you're right, US usually just invades, disposes the sitting ruler/gov't and installs a puppet while sacking the resources. As you did in Iraq and Afghanistan, Libya and Syria et al. 

And yes, you showed up in Europe in WWII to help out, but this happened at the point that it was clear that the Red Army and allied forces had basically wiped out the Nazi forces. Prior to that,  the american position was ""let them fight and kill eachother, not our business"". Then Japan attacked Pearl Harbour and you had to deal with them. You ended up nuking two cities, resulting in hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties.

As for rebuilding, my guess is that you are referring to the Marshall Plan. Which acted as a double edged sword - on one hand it did help rebuild the infrastructure, industry, etc, while also creating vassal states for the US (which is basically why Germany has no agency of its own today). Since then, you haven't done shit in that regard. Look at how you ""rebuilt"" Afghanistan or Syria for excellent examples of American humanitarian work lol

Anyway, this is getting long-winded. It was wrong of me to single out Texas as being stolen. Of course, I meant the _whole_ of US is stolen land. Stolen from Native American tribes, genocided by European settlers - your ancestors. Sometimes, tricked into giving it up through chicanery as it was with the acquisition of Manhattan. 

So, yes, it _is_ rich reading Americans parading a ""holier than thou"" attitude when it comes to any invasion. Disgusting, really. In particular, _this_ invasion which could have been avoided in its entirety if not for US regime change operations that have been going on for 20 years in the region. 

> You should be glad that we support NATO so much, even though Russia is virtually no threat to us.

I'm glad we're on the same page here. Russia is, indeed, not a threat to the US in the military sense of the word. Save for nukes, that is. The only reason for NATO's existance is to fleece the member states, perpetuate US interests and fuel the US military-industrial complex.

EDIT - lol this clown blocked me. Absolutely pathetic. What else would one expect from Americans. ""People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones"" isn't a thing in USA, I guess. 🤡",2022-10-11 09:03:42

Oil is just a nice boost to the Scottish economy, for a nation of 5 million we have a 11 billion pound tourism industry, a flourishing space and engineering industry worth another projected 5 billion, we export whisky to the tune of 5 billion. Our food and drink industry is worth 14 billion. Our salmon fisheries are worth another billion - Our economy is pretty diverse and multi-faceted. 

There's also the fact we are currently producing enough clean energy to power every home in Scotland for a year, and we're improving our renewables continually, so when oil is phased out there won't be a loss to our energy needs - and if we create a Norway style oil fund in the interim we'll have a money pot to fall on if the transition from carbon to neutral is economically difficult. 

The deficit 'black hole' issue is a total red herring because 1; it's based on figure calculated from the existing UK relationship - which won't exist soon, and 2; Scotland has no monetary borrowing powers, meaning we cannot be debt creators. Whatever deficit share we have within the UK would have to be negotiated upon exit, and if those negotiations get nasty - that sum could be 0. 

There are far more pros to being an autonomous, fiscally and environmentally responsible nation that's outward looking, democratic and progressive - something Westminster and the British political status quo will never be - than cons of severing the ties of a mere 300 year old union. It's pretty clear cut that Scotland and England/Wales are going in different directions, Scotland never gets who we vote for in elections, and because of our relative size - we never will. Scotland consistently votes left leaning and progressive, whilst the opposite is true down south. 

The UK is archaic and Machiavellian, as are it's customs and institutions, it's just not something I admire, identity with or wish to remain part of.",2019-09-12 08:29:35

If the government would reconsider their position in the light of recent events we would be at 66.5 % and good to go. But as I mentioned above I believe it is a highly unlikely scenario… 

If I understand things correctly current sentiment is that 1) Nato would save us anyway because we are too important for control of the Baltic sea, and 2) EU-membership means the rest of the member states will step in militarily to aid us.

I understand how one might interpret the EU-article in question as to mean that. But I am unsure if EU-countries would truly follow through with military, especially since there is not a clear command structure for such an organised intervention, to my understanding at least.

This is a prime example of what you guys do. You don’t actually read what people say.

I haven’t forgotten what it was like to be 15, or 22, or 30, etc. I accept everyone as they are and hope to get the same in return, but I know that won’t always happen. 😞
I embrace technology. I don’t believe that all people fit in a certain mold whether it be Millennial or Boomer; Muslim or Christian; or Conservative or Liberal. Everyone is nuanced and that’s awesome! I like the differences. I learn from them and hope that I might have something to teach. 

I don’t believe people deserve respect because of their status or title or ranking. Respect is earned by one’s good acts, particularly when NOT taken with the expectation of being seen. I refuse to stereotype people because of their race, beliefs, age, sexual identity, or any other factor. There is good and bad in everyone. (Hopefully more good!) In my world, everyone starts with a clean slate, regardless of where they came from, what they look like, what they’ve experienced in life (or haven’t), or how much money is in their wallet.

Now it seems like it’s time for something cheesy like, “if everyone believed this, the world would be a better place.” But, would it? Or wouldn’t the mere act of saying that negate everything I just said? 

We will always have the haters, the racists, the naysayers, the diversity that makes us human. So, I won’t say that because I don’t believe it. If we were all the same, this world would be VERY boring. Nauseatingly so. So, peace! Live and let live! Be the light you want to see in the world.

If one break the law, they do the time. They have to pay for their crimes. By working, they pay their debt to the society that they wrecked havoc on. 


Normal everyday people aren't subjected to this. Regular people who do not break laws aren't subjected to prison time where they have to pay their debt to the society.


It's not like USA goes around picking random people off the street to enslave nor do they go after specific race or religious group to enslave them and work them like dogs. 


If you break the law, you pay for your crime.

I show you evidence of it in the USA and you brush it off as ""they have to pay for their crimes"". The liberal mind will never fail to astound me. 😂😂😂",2024-02-13 01:34:48
1aozwyh,"..... what you said made no sense. What evidence of slavery? Prison time? 


You break the law. You do the time. How hard is that to understand? Even a 5 years old understand that.


To reiterate your point, if I break a law in China, then obviously I am at their mercy because I broke the laws. It's how it works. 


However, if I was a Uigher Muslim who wants to practice my own culture, China government will enslave me just simply because I exist, not because I broke the laws. 


USA doesn't do that. Russia does. India does. China does. All because you exist, not because you broke the laws. 


That's the difference between them and USA. 


It's obvious you are anti-American trying to label USA as the bad guys like China, Russia and India are and failing miserably at it. LOL. 


Also, what does a liberal mind has to do with this? Like what? Wow. That kind of a talk is clearly your brain in a slow rotting decay. What a real genuine average redditor moment with you. 🙄",2024-02-13 01:55:24

Canadians have far more in common with mainland Europeans than they do with the US, as the Wikipedia article states - many shared values at every level from sports to freedoms and equality. 

Canada was actually one of the first to support same sex marriage with the EU having some of the first member states also supporting it. Germany even recently fully made it legal. 

Many identities Canadians share from gay rainbow flag to pride parades are also European origin, same with the creation of the United Nations and many NGO's that support needy children across the world.

What sanctions? The autocracy keeps all the money to themselves, exiles mainly in the US send a lot of their hard earned US dollars to sustain their families.

Fucking Reddit and these tankies. I lived 30 years in Cuba, at no point the US opressed me.

- We don’t vote for the President 
- We couldn’t sell our houses until 2012
- If you are a Doctor and want to leave the country they get to keep you “punished” for 5 years 
- Until 2008 we were not allowed to own a Passport 
- Not only we need Visas for most countries in the World the state police can block you from leaving just because 
- A good salary is the equivalent of $25 dollars a month; then there’s not a regular store to buy groceries with Pesos because that just for the bodegas in where a family of 4 gets 5 pounds of chicken a month for “free” (no breasts). But hey bring those CUC to the store and we’ll sell you 3 drumsticks 🍗  for $5!
- Before 2012 no one but some “special” folks could have Internet. Besides being overpriced is tied to your ID; so they can track all of your online activities.

I can go on and on. None of the above is the fault of anyone besides the dictatorship.

Ahh… if you participated in the protests last year… you know, those alike all over the world you’re facing 25 YEARS in prison. You get out of jail faster by murdering in Cuba than for protesting the government that is starving you to death!

Edit:

The US sanctions have barely an impact. I know this because I’ve lived through all of that, is political fanfare and a scapegoat for all the problems we’re facing there.

And and best is disingenuous, Cuba gets more money from the US than anything else. The fact is that indirectly they trade more with the US than any other countries they still do.

They have evaded trade embargos for decades through proxies, yet this fallacy keeps being perpetuated. And the reason why they’re not removed altogether is because the political arm of Republicans that claim to have the best interests of the Cuban people benefit from said scapegoat as well… 60 years and it hasn’t brought down the dictatorship; but the likes of Rubio/Cruz will say they’re tough on the regime.

The only ones losing are the 11 million poor and oppressed people.

I yearn for the day these “sanctions” are removed to see what excuse will they use to justify the extreme poverty of my people.",2022-02-12 23:38:18

t6f752,"Cheap Chinese tires might be the root had this been a Honda CRV or Ford F150, no I don't think so.

I've been watching the narrative of Russian propaganda for some time, and it's become very clear Putin has become paranoid of an attack. Not a nuclear one, a combined air and ground conventional warfare.

He's old, tired, scared and alone. His coffers are dry and the Soviet equipment have been getting ""upgrades"" for as long as they've been outdated (and sitting rotting for even longer).

No functional new tanks, none mass-produced or even normally produced just a handful of prototypes paraded around and made to look impressive. Truly the embodiment of a pig in lipstick. He has used proxy wars, because he can't afford or successfully field an offensive...

The troops have zero experience. What have they really fought this Millenia? The country is too big, the Soviet junk can barely be jump-started and has been sitting rotting/collecting dust for decades! They are sitting in a 70km+ line on a road, out of fuel, food, morale completely paralyzed by incomptetence... We are seeing the culmination of these facts, combined with the fact that Russia doesn't consider what they are doing warcrimes using WWII era cluster bombs that don't even go off, using artillery from literally WWII to shell with the most rudimentary and basic equipment. Not to mention the great Soviet rail lines, ah the rail systems that won the war against Germany in WWII (very effective back then, now not so much considering its already been crippled in Ukraine and obviously not very effective getting even fuel or food to the frontlines lol).

They've not actually not done any meaningful damage to the Ukrainian Government or Military, only blind-firing civilian apartment complexes (not surprising  considering the Moscow Apartment bombings he was responsible for, he is an expert Terrorists running a Criminal-Terrorist State)... This is disgusting because of the innocents affected, but factual proof the Russian military is incompetent. At this point they cannot even take down small Drones that have decimated their ranks, yet they claim to have advanced anti-air defense systems (so-called S300, S400 & S500)? Where is there ANY evidence of them successfully intercepting any target intentionally (besides the Soviet Russia SAM that took down a civilian aircraft MH17, good job Terrorist-State targeting civilians again as usual)? There is PLENTY of instances where state of the art S400 systems failed to do anything at all in Syria (They forgot to turn them on, sounds legit).

I don't believe that Russia even have meaningful air or missile defences. I don't believe that their Nuclear arsenal was ever fully operational (likely 50% or more were empty duds, but kept top secret so nobody could know), and ICBMs are extremely complex and expensive to maintain. Look at their pathetic Terrorist Attack on the Nuclear Power Plant, why didn't they send a precision missile and take out the administrative building they fired upon? They rolled up within 100 meters and fired with tanks... I don't even see evidence of their missile systems being able to accurately hit targets over large distances... Let alone missiles left decaying in abandoned bunkers for half a century without and maintenance... I believe that *they believe* their propaganda is strong enough of a deterrent that nobody will test. We know they had multiple disasters trying to test nuclear missiles recently in Siberia, which resulted in irradiation of the entire region and untold Russian casualties. Not a single successful test since then, kaput.

Russia is only adept at 1) Propaganda 2) Terrorist Attacks on Innocent Civilians 3) Mass Nuclear Disasters and attacks onto their own people

Who honestly believes a country in such poverty that, at it's highest it was barely equal to the US State of Texas in GDP, has maintained the world's largest and most sophisticated Military and iCBM arsenal... So, what is the world *really* to be afraid of? Putin, a man rumored to have been in a bunker for 2 years? 🧐",2022-03-05 01:21:27

So Russia's relying on cheap Chinese tires to fight a war with? That makes them look even more stupid and incompetent 🤦🤦🤦

The dry rot is a real issue in industrial tires for trucks and heavy machinery that requires very expensive tires, that's why even Joe Shmoe with his construction company can maintain the rubber on his rig... The Russian military having such a widespread issue is beyond embarrassing lol

They generally know the absolute lowest base salary internally would be x and the highest would be xx. This internal information becomes external. This works really well for corporations in WA and CO that have pay transparency laws. 

In the German corporation I worked at, this info was available for internal hires (TV Gruppe) just not make public. It would be very easy for them to translate the Gruppe salaries into a range and make public.

When you look at actual rational measurements the war has weakened Russia immeasurably and trapped them in an even stupider version of the Iraq war. Their sphere of influence is beginning to show signs of breaking apart and Russia is more dependent than ever on China who are not their friends. It's not rational to 'go to war with the west' (as the Russians seem to think this is) when you have almost a trillion dollars in Western holdings just waiting to be frozen and used as leverage or just given to Ukraine.

1b5lo04,"I find it bizarre, when seeing comments like ""just go do the revolution, why do you choose to be slaves?"". Mostly this is just your average rusophobic keyboard warrior, but sometimes it really seems to be a genuine question. And it always struck me, yes, probably some of those people are either stupid or naive, but maybe some of them live in a completely different environment, so they cannot comprehend this situation in Russia, just as I cannot believe their way of thought, like, isn't it obvious why?

So, okay, let me explain why ""just go defeat putin"" won't work. We cannot establish how many russians are support him or don't, so let's imagine, that half of them are really want him gone. But, as any casual dictator, he's not planning to leave. So you have to start a Revolution™. How? Organizing peaceful protests? Illegal in Russia, you're literally would end up in prison, dragged there by the police from the street. If you would try to resist or help someone from being dragged, you would also be beaten by kind policeman and would end in prison for lot more more years. And, anyway, nothing would change, as government is still corrupt and propaganda would make sure that either nothing happened or it was organized by the enemy agents from west. 

Okay, this isn't working. Maybe it's time for non-peaceful protest? Cool, right, but how? Are you going to prepare weapons, molotovs and smoke bombs to use them against police? Sounds good. Are you going to do this solo? If so, good luck finding yourself being only one person with weapons in a peaceful protest. You probably either won't use your tools, or would end up in prison for the rest of your life as a terrorist. Are you planning to organize a crowd? Cool. What's your methods. It's not 1809. Not even 1999. Most people get their news from internet and social media. And, also, small detail, Russia literally have a special department to spy on people using internet. So if you would try to organize people through the social media, you're just inviting a swat team to your home. Maybe darknet? Sure, maybe you would find 10, maybe 20 people to your cause, without being noticed. It is still just 20 guys with homemade stuff against hundreds of policeman trained to beat the shit out of people.

To wrap it up. On the one hand, there is a ruthless mechanism of control, with thousands of brainwashed militarized people, who forms police, censors, spies, propagandists, and it is literally their job to control and destroy any signs of protests by any means (I mean literally, you reading this under the post of killed russian opposition leader). On the other hand there is you. You have nothing and you cannot do anything significant.

Because Poland and more of Europe are under Nato and putin doesn't want the nuclear smoke. But isn't afraid to give it.

And russia feels it has the right to put boots on the ground to support the ethnic Russians of Eastern Ukraine under years of shelling by the Ukrainians. I guess people seem to forget that part. 😕

I remember the draws in our house being choked full of random cables and chargers from all the different companies using their own cable variants and even changing them from model to model on a near yearly basis.

 And god forbid you needed to try go into a shop to find a cable or charger in a pinch. The chances of them having your exact set up wasn't a garuntee. When you think of that on a global scale the amount of waste is mind boggling and a much better reason than some weird kink for a certain cable standard that you personally think is better.

You can definitely work without it, but the back button just simplifies a ton of interactions.

And regarding the logic, sure, that's valid, however for the past 30 years we've had a thing everybody on this planet that has touched a computer has used, we call that thing a ""web browser"".

I recommend you to look it up, you magnificent advocates of democracy. It's not unique or unheard of thing. Chances are, if you live at democratic country yourself, you have one too. Referendums are not foregone conclusion, especially ones that would take year(s), ***especially*** in a situation like this.

It would be under constant manipulation, threats and terror, Russia attempting to affect the referendum. Come on, it's not fucking rocket science.

***ALSO*** here we have Finnish civilian petition for joining NATO which gathered required 50k signatures to be sent to our parliament **within days** ([https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/aloite/9997](https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/aloite/9997)).

Meanwhile, civilian petition for us to NOT join NATO has only gathered 13k+ signatures and it's been there gathering signatures for **almost month now** ([https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/aloite/10354](https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/aloite/10354)).

You can find out more about our civilian petition system (in English) here ([https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/ohjeet/briefly-in-english](https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/ohjeet/briefly-in-english)).

Decision to not have referendum is not only because of some poll that 5k-10k people answered, it is decision of many things like discussions between our representatives, political parties, our security personnel, other nations, public discourse here at Finland...

What's the closest Putin has been to the front? Seems he's so paranoid he barely leaves the safety of his palaces these days.

1ayictr,"I agree with having lost the ability to murder political enemies at will, but that is largely due to a structural reorganization of the FSB and not due to an overall loss of capabilities. Putin is cruel, he's evil, he miscalculates often but he is not *stupid*. Until Ukraine, he was able to assess what Russia could do with their budget and resources against what the West could do with theirs. The breadth of CIA resources embedded in Russia is impossible to overstate. There's an old Russian joke that says the assassin and the assassinated take orders from the same guy in Washington. 

The choice was made to shift the scope of intelligence services operations against the West decades ago. Putin knows that on the ground, Russia absolutely cannot compete against its traditional enemies. However, I personally believe that there is no greater intelligence program on the planet than Russian psyops since the 1960s. Russian intelligence understands the Western psyche more deeply than we do ourselves. Their hands are all over every civil rift we've experienced since the civil rights movement. For pennies on the dollar, long before bots and ai, Russia has been able to drive a wedge in every western country regarding any issue they please. It's been so effective that we don't even need their help anymore, we're trained to do it ourselves. And the craziest thing to me is that I've read from Americans, on this website and others, that the constitutional right to free speech extends to enemy agents abroad 😂

s58vb0,">	why would someone buy shares in a company and do nothing with it? exact same thing is happening here.

Because it can promise a reward in the future.  But I’m also not paying these taxes on a share of stock lol.  Completely different thing.  Nobody would buy a house as an investment if they knew the supply of houses were going up.

>	there is a reason why there is a heavy push for additional tax for empty apartments which at least would incentivize actually renting out property a bit more. sadly won’t happen with neoliberal governments.

No neoliberals would agree with LVT or something like a tax on empty housing.  They wouldn’t agree with rent control like basically all economists.  Bad zoning is a big issue with neoliberals.

[They would agree with this](https://www.theurbanist.org/2021/06/02/new-round-of-studies-underscore-benefits-of-building-more-housing/)

Edit since they locked it:

>	just like housing promises a reward in the future. prices go up, your investment goes up. same thing.

That’s not how supply and demand work. It simply isn’t.  Even in your Vienna example they are renting out the apartments.  

>	also - at least where i live you obviously also pay taxes on stock profits. a lot more than on property actually.

When you sell not continuously…  Completely different.

>	well, tell that to the people investment billions into building more and more housing no one lives in.

[Ok](https://www.vox.com/22524829/wall-street-housing-market-blackrock-bubble)

There isn’t enough supply.  [One of the largest studies ever on supply vs rent](https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/research/market-rate-development-impacts/)

>	yeah, exactly what i said.

It’s not though…

>	they fuck us by lessening regulation, selling public housing and preventing additional taxes to combat empty apartments all over the city.

LVT… I literally said that 🤦‍♂️

>	we can see it happen in real time over the last years and right now. we can also easily see it happen to all other cities like berlin, or much sooner london, paris. and we don’t even need to start with american cities.

>Do any of protests gain any visibility or traction?

Visibility -- no. 

I doubt state TV would talk about any protest in Russia unless there's literal million of people rocking the walls of Kremlin. And even then they would say propaganda stuff that protests are west-aided, anti-government and organized by the methods of ""orange revolution"" (propaganda really loves to scaremong with 🍊 revolution).

On the internet there's also no visibility as current protests are way too small (not even 10k in Moscow?). A lot of public faces speak up and say that they're against the war, but that's all limited to posts on social media. No calls to action (i.e. gathering for a protest) or anything. Government / state media tries to downplay them.

There's a lot of open letters to stop the war from different spheres. Some people get in trouble because of that (getting fired for wrong views is easy).

Gaining traction? 

Seems like it's slowing down instead, because way too few people gather. Police picks/beats protestors one by one and packs them into busses, they get fined/jailed for up to two weeks for unauthorized protest. Yes, we're on that level of dystopian, you have to get approval for a protest. 

Local NGO ovdinfo.org that tracks / provides legal aid to people under political repressions reports that 6648 people were arrested on anti-war protests since first day. So the number of protesters was low on the first day and then less and less each day (IIRC if you get arrested protesting three times in a year you'll be charged with felony).

Non completely puppet opposition party Yabloko tries to get protest approved for 12th of March.

If government allows it and it's not too late (you have to apply paperwork 10 days in advance. Yes, that dystopian) there's possibility of significantly more people would show up there.

> Fuck. Do you see any hope in changing public opinion?

I have a feeling it's extremely polarised. You're either with Ukraine or Russia. And both don't like each other, which creates unpleasant tensions. I've been really thinking how it could end up in civil war, lol.

In last two days there's those tensions started showing up within government -- suddenly there's people that don't agree within.

I don't think it would change unless there's countless loses that public knows about. Seems like 5k from Russia side isn't enough. Government doesn't reveal numbers, by the way. And saying anything other than government position/information about war is prohibited. So you wouldn't know about 5k Ukraine claim from TV or newspapers. Nor about any other number.


p.s. some examples of dystopian stuff / how much Russia fears any kind of protests:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Moscow_protests

>Yegor Zhukov 3 years suspended sentence; published a YouTube video with criticism of police actions during the 27 July rally

>Sergey Abanichev threw a paper cup towards a policeman; prosecution really tried to imprison him for 3-8 years for that, but happily charges dropped after public outcry

>Konstatin Kotov sentenced on 05.09.2019; 4 years imprisonment for	multiple participation in unapproved rallies

In my case it's stories I've heard from my mother about her parents in the war, or stories from my great-aunt about her own experience and that of her (my) family that give me that connection. You then multiply what they went through by several million. 😔 

In Canada, I find the commemoration and memorialisation of the First World War and its victims to be quite interesting. I don't have any stories about the First World War from either side of the family, so I understand theoretically that the Great War was the bloodiest war in Canadian history, which makes Remembrance Day very poignant, but I still don't feel it as deeply as I do the Second World War.

Targeted at a single person, with a name.

It *was* done to achieve political goals (like all political assassinations), however it wasn't done by a systematic use of violence and it wasn't done to generate fear in wider population.

☑ violence

☑ political objective

There was a huge empire, and it suddenly occupied another large piece of land it has never been on before, with some people already living in it. Those people weren't very happy with that, since they had no say in the matter whatsoever. Eventually, a guy representing that empire got killed there. 

That is a bit different than, say: there is this developed country, that bombed a little bit here and a little bit there, and now the people from those bombed countries are coming all the way to this european country and blowing up buildings and themselves and shooting random innocent people, and stabbing them, and running them over, killing hundreds, causing mass panic and putting some pressure on the said country's government(s) so they would stop bombing or whatever they're doing.

You may say that both of these have political purpose and violence in common. But you can see that the methods vary drastically. We should be careful applying terms we are still defining today to something that happened 100 years ago and labeling it like that, since it may lead to some serious misconceptions about the past, and then about the present.

And also, my father was an alcoholic narcissist. I don’t look half bad (I have prior posts on reddit gets drawn if you’re curious) but it’s a psychological thing. All I see are my flaws.

It may be indeed easier to get nude it in Germany. Although it's far from being a popular thing, it's widespread enough so that most bystanders don't care. Weirdos are sadly everywhere in the world.

Now, I don't really have any first hand experience, but I know there're groups of people who get together naked for various social activities (hiking, sports, perhaps many more), their stated goal being indeed learning to accept and like their bodies. Don't you have such groups in the US? Maybe this would be something for you to try? Being in a group should reduce chances of unpleasant encounters.

Muslim heads of state, scholars, imams, leaders and groups condemned the attacks, many before ISIL claimed responsibility. These included the imam who heads the University of Al-Azhar in Egypt; the Supreme council of Religious Scholars in Saudi Arabia; Iranian president Hassan Rouhani and the Ahmadiyya caliph Mirza Masroor Ahmad.

Ahrar ash-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam, the major mainstream Islamist rebels against the Syrian regime, both condemned the attacks. Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, condemned the attacks, and expressed his solidarity with the French people. Other militant groups also condemned the attacks, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine.

It’s sad.

This is what I see on the news and in California

And when I say regulations I say like it’s up to the social media platforms to do the work the protect the children and young adults from the adult posts. Sure the parents are allowing the children on these devices however parents are not always able to understand a certain platforms standards and guidelines. it’s just pure behavior in front of the parent and then they lock the door bc the parent “trusts the kid to do the right thing”, know that 1 in 4 of the internet is porn.

[Charlie Hebdo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo) is a magazine with cartoons and other satirical items. It publishes 'offensive' cartoons and jokes about anything. Atheists, left-wing, right-wing, Christianity, Islam, politics in general, etc.. 

On January 7th 2015* two gunmen forced their way into the Paris HQ of Charlie Hebdo and opened fire. This resulted in the death of 12 staff members. The gunmen shouted 'Allah Akbar' (""God is great"" in Arabic) and also ""the Prophet is avenged"". 

The gunmen, the two shitstains, were named Shitstain Saïd Kouachi and Shitstain Chérif Kouachi. I didn't make that up, those are their real names. (May they burn in hell 🙏)

The phrase ""Je suis Charlie"" was coined soon after the attack, to show sympathy to the creators of the magazine and support freedom of speech/resistance to armed threats.

And AFAIK there have been groups and people with hateful, ""far right""-like beliefs throughout history.

These beliefs always exist, it's just a question of how far they penetrate into the mainstream of a society.

I feel like the main approach for keeping these damaging, horrible, stupid beliefs out of society has been making them socially unacceptable.

But right now they seem to become more and more socially acceptable.... these things can change, and this approach starts to look kind of dangerous.

Actually debating people seems more waterproof to me I guess.

The problem with debating is, that (well, I think so) very few people are good at it, and that it's very exhausting.

People just don't like doing it because, it takes a lot of mental energy...

So while everybody debating the actual issues would be somewhat of an ideal solution, I doubt that it's feasible....

But we can at least try to strive for that idea!

I’d say 100% based off of past military exercises, show of force, measuring of the dicks If you will… if this is successful of Putin and non damaging to Russia, China will follow suit with Taiwan. Taiwan being an actual NATO member, if China invaded we are going to WW3 regardless as we are tied to defend NATO members by treaty. That would be horrible. And everyone has seen this all coming for a long time. Putin has shown he was ready to step his country into that path, starting something he knew would lead to mass casualties, but believed he could do without consequence. This is a tough  , multifaceted issue. You are 💯 correct in what you say, but I think it was going that way anyway unfortunately. There may be a small chance of it not getting that far if we make the right choices, whatever the hell those may be! Ughhh goddamn, what a lovely time to be alive huh!?",2022-02-27 07:08:44

And if other countries cared they’d get off their asses and stop trying to look good for the public by sending money and actually go there and do something. But they won’t. Because sadly there’s no reason for them to (at least, strictly speaking for saving Ukraine just to save Ukraine. If anything, they’re probably seeing it as collateral damage towards something that should’ve been done long ago). 

The people there know this reality. I’m pretty sure I’m one of the few who can actually recognize streets from the news there and am staying in contact with friends I have there now. I offered to fly them out and stay in my flat from the beginning (flights were impossible to get). Now that I can’t bring them here I offered to send western union (this was the only way I found to send money while I was actually in Kiev). They told me it would be a waste of time to send money there because everything is closed except grocery stores. 

I’m depressed about it- probably genuinely more than 95% of these fake “Reddit warriors” giving Putin a piece of their mind 😂 Seriously, this just makes them look even more pathetic if they actually had a sense of reality. I’ve been in a bad mood about if the last few days and have been struggling to appear happy for my family- even more so because I know the reality and am not looking at with “Murica, fuck yeah” goggles.",2022-02-26 13:12:34
t1s0wy,"Yeah and I’ve actually been to Ukraine, recognize streets showed on the news, and actually offered TO HELP FRIENDS WHO ARE THERE AS I WRITE THIS. 

Get it out your American brainwashed mind that someone is either completely with or against you and look at it in the reality of the situation. 

Call me a disgrace because I’ve actually been there. Because I’m speaking on reality. Tell me how you worked at a fucking desk and think you have any knowledge because you watched some fucking documentary and became the “talk of the town” because you went back to your small town/group of friends and they can be impressed. I’m living life in reality. 

I don’t want Ukraine to lose. But I also know very well how they are only in a “victim” position because of what’s happening now. 2 months ago they would’ve scammed and talked shit about YOU. The country has literally screwed over, cheated,lied, and sold out to literally anybody just to buy nicer clothes (I can elaborate on this if you’d like). They have the reputation to everyone in Europe and more of being scammers/etc. and they wouldn’t have hesitated to call you a “stupid American” in their language directly to your face until they wanted money. Now they’re fucked up and disappointed absolutely nobody came to help- to the point they had to ban men from leaving to fight. Seriously, think about how pathetic this is and after knowing this has been going on for YEARS. 

But I get it. Heart strings are being pulled because white people are in trouble…..This happens all the time in the world and nobody cares….

Again, I don’t want them to those because of course ALL people aren’t what I described but I can see the reality. And like anything I talk about- I’m the only person who had real ties/relations with this topic then end up communicating with people who get offended and think they’re some type of “justice fighter” in the world  because they’re looking at it with “ignorant hope goggles” 😂",2022-02-27 08:41:31

fo1e1f,Man you had to start a shit-storm didn’t you. 😂,2020-03-24 11:24:04
fo1e1f,Yeah but a global organisation couldn’t possibly plan for local pandemic response if the pandemic stretches across the entire globe. Smaller regional organisations would probably be better and knowledgeable in coordinating actions in a smaller area. Also this doesn’t mean the ECDC can’t coordinate with the WHO. ☺️,2020-03-24 11:12:23
fo1e1f,"Yeah, that’s probably a good start. After SARS, China had the experience to ramp up mask production, so in that regards they were better prepared for this.

Edit: Sorry I misunderstood what you said! I thought you meant the EU should produce more medical equipment 😅😅😅😅  

But I agree with you too. As an inter European organisation, if set up properly, the EU would probably be able to respond quicker to local outbreaks and divert supplies to the most needed areas. So instead of having a bunch of independent states operating or coordinating independently, there would be one organisation to take care of everything.",2020-03-24 09:08:27
fo1e1f,"Yeah that’s why I think there needs to be an independent inquiry as to why the EU was so unprepared for this.

There's the reality of costs and scale...
Romania
19 million over 238,000 square km so ~80 ppl per square km.

US
328 million over 9.28 million square km, so ~35 ppl per square km

And even beyond the scale, we know it's not an even distribution of people in the US. It's not the government funding the infrastructure, after all.

It's asking a LOT for a private company to lay infrastructure to rural areas where it would take decades of service to get back the costs (if it doesn't simply bankrupt them). This is a similar problem that utility companies have, and power companies in particular struggle (with the onset of household solar).

—

Here is a timeline list of controversies that the Polish governing party Law and Justice (PiS) has faced:

- 2015: Constitutional Crisis: PiS takes control of the Constitutional Tribunal and makes controversial changes to its functioning, leading to protests and concerns over the independence of the judiciary.

- 2016: Media Law Changes: PiS introduces laws that increase government control over public media, sparking fears of media censorship and undermining press freedom.

- 2017: Judicial Reforms: PiS passes laws that allow for the government to exert greater control over the appointment and dismissal of judges, leading to widespread protests and criticism from the European Union.

- 2018: Holocaust Law: PiS passes a law criminalizing accusations of Polish complicity in the Holocaust, which sparks international criticism and strains relations with Israel and the United States.

- 2019: LGBT-Free Zones: Several local authorities, mostly governed by PiS, declare themselves ""LGBT-free zones,"" leading to condemnation from human rights organizations and the European Union.

- 2020: Presidential Elections: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, PiS pushes forward with controversial changes to the electoral process, including a last-minute switch to postal voting, raising concerns about the fairness and transparency of the elections.

- 2021: Rule of Law Concerns: The European Union expresses concerns over the erosion of the rule of law in Poland, particularly regarding judicial independence, media freedom, and the functioning of democratic institutions.

- 2022: LGBTQ+ Rights: PiS proposes a constitutional amendment banning same-sex couples from adopting children, leading to further criticism from human rights organizations and the international community.

There have been allegations and controversies regarding certain members of the Law and Justice (PiS) party in Poland and their relationships with Russia. 

Here are a few notable instances:

- Jarosław Kaczyński: As the leader of PiS, Jarosław Kaczyński has been accused of having close ties with Russia.

- Mateusz Morawiecki: Mateusz Morawiecki, the former Prime Minister of Poland and member of PiS, has been involved in diplomatic relations with Russia as part of his official duties.

- Antoni Macierewicz: Antoni Macierewicz, a former Minister of Defense in Poland under the PiS government, has faced allegations of having pro-Russian sympathies.

- Zbigniew Ziobro: Zbigniew Ziobro, a prominent member of PiS and the Minister of Justice, has faced criticism for his alleged pro-Russian leanings.",2023-06-04 21:23:55

Most of the victims were teenagers attending a summer camp, they were there to have a good time, to have fun. Instead they got treated to hail off gunfire, indiscriminate murder. 69 summer campers never returned. Over a hundred came home with physical and mental wounds.

Bit of a double standard there no?

Nobody thinks that a binding promise was made to stay in the EU and therefore Brexit shouldn't have been allowed 😂 Just that a key reason for people staying in the UK disappeared and many people have changed their mind about independence due to it.

But you're right that the unionist argument about ""once in a generation"" is absurd. In both cases politicians don't have the right to make binding promises about the future. Why are unionists so anti democratic that they don't understand that?",2021-03-06 10:07:32

Probably a reference to Fuck the Tories™ and Boris as well somewhere too, but those were the first that stood out. Regardless, jokes aside, to your actual points:

>A well funded Scotland outside the UK AND the EU would be better than an underfunded shithole in either.

Irrelevant since its not going to be ""and"". The entire justification of a new independence referendum and backtracking by the SNP on the previous independence one is membership of the European Union. I know there are some Scottish Nationalists who are against both, but that doesn't seem to be the mainstream view of the SNP and the majority of independence supporters. Granted, if you have a poll to say otherwise, would love to see.

>If i had to choose between having a GDP 10% higher or having a large social democratic welfare state i'd choose the second one

I appreciate the sentiment, however, I believe the choice isn't as possible as you think. There is more evidence at the moment to show that leaving the UK will negatively effect the wealth of Scotland. Scotland joining the EU as an independent state wouldn't offer any advantages in EU exports, it would mean a huge cut in exports to the UK which is estimated to cause the Scottish GDP to be lower by 8.4%.

This gives a good explanation: [https://voxeu.org/article/gains-economic-integration-eu](https://voxeu.org/article/gains-economic-integration-eu) (not just for Scotland, it analyses the effects of trade within and between countries in the EU, Canada etc as well).

Likewise, having a large social democratic welfare state isn't something on the table for the immediate future at least. The EU has a debt limit of 60% of GDP and a deficit limit of 3% (I believe someone has already covered that), both of which Scotland would exceed by a large margin.

The EU is flexible and could let Scotland join with a debt and deficit that exceeded the targets, but only with a plan in place to reduce them, and with that plan already demonstrating results. In other words, Scotland could join the EU during its period of intense austerity, it wouldn't have to complete the process first.

The IFS have already provided their assessment of the SNP’s Sustainable Growth Commission’s highlighting that austerity will be the case as well: [https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/13072](https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/13072)

Now I know you can argue and say the Tories will carry out austerity anyway, however, due to the fiscal transfer the UK provides Scotland that amounts to £2,000 (2.322,91 Euros) per head per year. This is greater than the ones given by the EU, for example Latvia receives the largest net fiscal transfer per head from the EU, at 580 Euros: [https://ec.europa.eu/budget/graphs/revenue\_expediture.html](https://ec.europa.eu/budget/graphs/revenue_expediture.html) Meaning that you will likely have more cuts and less money. I also believe the fiscal transfer alone is 6.1% of GDP but not completely sure on that.

Nevertheless, do I think Scotland can't become independent? No, it can, just like how the UK left the EU. It will survive fine. However, will it be better off? No, there isn't anything to suggest that is the case.",2021-03-06 16:24:14

Fun facts about how we celebrate independence. Obviously usually there are many events that are now cancelled because of Corona, but aside from the business as usual as in partying with your  friends/family


1.	Drink some glögg, eat some pastries (puffy plum tarts, gingerbread cookies)
2.	It’s traditional to visit (war) graves. For example students do a torch cavalcade in various university towns. 
3.	Watch Unkown Soldier on tv
4.	Watch people celebrate on the Presidential Independence Day Reception. Yes, you celebrate by looking at how others celebrate on the TV with your friends and family. And judge away all the people attending the Castle Ball.
5.	Go to brunches, eat good food
6.	Put two candles on your window at 6 o´clock. It’s a tradition that traces back to the 19th century, apparently it become a symbol against Russian oppression and legend says it was used as a signal to young me traveling secretly to Sweden and Germany to become jägers that the house is ready to host them and hide them from the Russians.

Independence day is usually a lot more tranquil than i.e hockey celebrations.  It’s not a giant crazy party, but more focused on wars and hardships, remembering those who were here before you. However, it is becoming more and more a light and livelier celebration each year. 😊 Enjoy guys!",2020-12-06 12:22:29

Yeah, alright then *Sheldon Cooper*🤣, you totally sound like the guy to interrupt a conversation with the nasty ""well, ACTUALLY"" that I made a promise to myself I would limit my interactions with, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt - the reason for why the decimal system was introduced at first is down-played to oblivion, fingers or not, humans intuitevely visualise objects in sets of 10 - it's easier to think of 80, 90 or 100 bottles of milk than 84, 108 or 144. Besides, all a dozenal scheme gets you is a set of numbers that most of the 7 x **10**^9 people can't read and won't bother to learn, all for the sacred division by 3 (but then division by 5 doesn't work). Note that dozenal solves division by three, but many rational numbers (a/b, where a and b are integers) can not be expressed in an arbitrary base. Try expressing one-tenth in units of 1/12, 1/144, 1/1728, etc. You merely trade one problem for another, which the dozenals simply fail to grasp. And that's not even mentioning the fact that the whole metric system works on base 10 and altering it at this point would be orders of magnitude more challenging than converting to current SI, and even that, as we can see in some *countries*, is too big of a task to attempt.",2021-09-19 15:10:55

Do you even know the words you are saying? What possessed you to believe that the Democrats aren't the political opposition of the Republicans? Are you saying they have the same ideology?🤣 Im certain you didn't know what political opposition really meant.

Political opposition: In politics, the opposition comprises one or more political parties or other organized groups that are opposed, primarily ideologically, to the government (or, in American English, the administration), party or group in political control of a city, region, state, country or other political body. The degree of opposition varies according to political conditions.

i068kp,"Actually it's you who has the simplistic view I'm afraid.

Let's have a look, using the [wikipedia definition of fascism](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fascism) to create our list:

❌ far right-wing 

❌ authoritarian 

❌ ultranationalism 

❌ dictatorial power 

❌ strong regimentation of society and of the economy 

❌ forcible suppression of opposition 


This last one is usually what the right screech about when they try to liken ANTIFA or 'leftists' with fascism, but it's so tenuous and disingenuous that it doesn't stand up to the slightest scrutiny. 

It completely depends on how you feel about counter-protests and whether those counter-protests initiate any violence. 

It is also only one small facet of fascism, so even if you had evidence of a small group initiating violence, that wouldn't make them fascists. It would make them violent protesters.",2020-07-29 21:47:36

Firstly it's all true, which makes the other levels just all the sweeter.

But we're this Elon Musk or any of the other US tech gurus, there would be an army defending the brand downvoting the comment and demanding Reddit find the poster and have them shot.

It's just silly how tech became a religion and you need to follow your brand.

Tesla for instance is worth more than all of the other large vehicle companies COMBINED. While producing about as many cars as Dodge (a Fiat / Stellantis brand now)
Why? Because of tech religion PR and idiots on the stockmaeket throwing money at it.

By comparison they thew 10^12 $ at the tesla company. The largest hope for humanity and most expensive research project of all time ITER brought up outrage when it smashed 4*10^10 $ in its budget.

If all that shit is lurking just below, I'm not sure I'm all that compelled by how neat the hedges are or how civil the cues are or how well-appointed the pubs are... There's an appetite for violence without restraint that's spread throughout, however subterranian, to permit its leaders to channel it, physically, in its military, and cognitively, in the population that permits It to happen.

That's my opinion, you don't have to share it, but I'd ask that you consider that that kind of savagery originates somewhere, and is then held culturally in ways that are very complicated to track. PTSD, for example, is an easy one to identify, but it's not the whole story.

So when we talk about a whole culture being barbaric, it's that holding and dispensing of such violence that I refer to. 

Not people gutting each other in the streets; that's societal unrest, the social order has  been destroyed. But when a culture as high-minded, precise, orderly as the English, chooses to do THAT with all of their power? That's barbaric at a societal level.",2018-06-13 15:55:29
8qh1kg,"Churchill was a zionist. Even you can't pretend otherwise. [There’s a statue of him in Jerusalem celebrating this fact.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/sir-winston-churchill-zionist-hero-8277918.html)

Are you truly trying to defend the imperial drug trade that was [intended to subdue a sovereign state and get its citizens addicted to opioids](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-opium-wars-the-bloody-conflicts-destroyed-imperial-china-17212)?

I honestly don't actually blame you for not knowing a lot of this, it's not taught. But it's also fact that the Irish famine was, to a large degree, intentionally exacerbated to punish the local population for not submitti to British rule.

>	Back in Famine time, the same potato crop disease occurred most heavily outside Ireland in Scotland, yet there were relatively few casualties as the landowners and government ensured, for their own sakes as much as anything, that there was no mass death. 

>	That was not the case in Ireland, where a very different mentality prevailed. The damned Irish were going to get what they deserved because of their attachment to Catholicism and Irish ways when they were refusing to toe the British line. 

>	As Coogan painstakingly recounts, every possible effort by local organizations to feed the starving was thwarted and frustrated by a British government intent on teaching the Irish a lesson and forcing market forces on them.

In fact, in several instances [British civil servants were punished for giving food to starving Irish citizens.](https://www.irishcentral.com/news/proving-the-irish-famine-was-genocide-by-the-british-tim-pat-coogan-moves-famine-history-unto-a-new-plane-181984471-238161151)

Charles Trevelyan was one of the worst offenders. He was in charge of implementing a policy following the famine best described by him as “Protestant and Catholic will freely fall and the land will be for the survivors.” 

Another gem from this asshole: “The real evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the Famine but the moral evil of the selfish, perverse and turbulent character of the people.” 

What's left, the Boer concentration camps? oook, here we go! From the British Archives;

>It has been estimated that between 20,000 and 28,000 white civilians died of disease in these camps. There were also 14,154 recorded deaths of black people from disease in the camps (over one in ten of the black camp population) and such deaths were under recorded.

>While the policy may have succeeded in military terms [forcing the Boers, it is believed, to surrender - thereby ending the war], it was a political disaster, earning the British a level of unpopularity on an international scale comparable to that of the USA during the Vietnam war. One contemporary critic even used the term 'holocaust'. Public criticism was, however, centred on the white camps; those for Africans, where provision was usually even poorer, were hardly mentioned in the debate.

Even British politicians at the time were calling it ""barbaric.""

From Emily Hobson, a British woman who visited the camps herself; 

>I call this camp system a wholesale cruelty … To keep these Camps going is murder to the children...

117wyva,"Just really want to ask who owns majority of the real estate in this area? In my home country, the major issue with foreigners is gov't policy allowing foreigners to buy many properties w/o requiring them to significantly stay/live in those properties. Most of the time they buy properties there/abroad as investment and to store their money away from their own home countries. Sometimes, they rent out the properties driving the prices higher bcos they have money to further develop the spaces thus, also outcompeting aspiring local homeowners. Other times, they just kept them vacant and not contributing to local businesses w/c ultimately, create fancy ghost towns. As the internet services improve in the region, it will also attract more digital nomads so, I wonder how this will affect the local housing market going forward.


p.s. yes, the biggest reason for the crazy real estate prices in my home country is not the foreigners (so far) it's really the few oligarchy families who has monopoly of land ownership and also conveniently hold powerful positions in the govt.

Whereas now post invasion countries that were traditionally neutral during the Cold War on Russia’s border are trying to join NATO and other countries like Kazakstan are realigning with China and their soft and hard power has decreased to such an extent that they can no longer deter nations in their military pact CSTO from fighting each other or from foreign aggression.

It’s just losses all around which I guess explains why they don’t want to pull out even though they’re so far in the hole 🕳️, it’s the whole sunk cost fallacy in play.",2022-12-21 22:49:38

cd18ct,"It's even messier than that.

We often use imperial for measurements relating to people (height, weight, circumferences, lengths) and metric for similar-sized measurements for inanimate objects, but then completely fail at converting between the two.

If someone tells me their height in metres I just stare blankly at them while trying to work out how many thirty centimetre rulers that would be, so I can convert to feet. 😅

And then there's the fact that liquids are normally metric... unless they're milk, beer or cider. Or a soft drink from a pub that's been served in a pint glass. And petrol is a weird case, in that it's sold in litres but we do fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.",2019-07-14 12:56:12

cd18ct,"The boiling point of WATER is an arbitrary choice? The single most imporant molecule to all live forms? The thing we are searching for on every rocky/icy planet in our solar system? The thing that may very well define life BY its physical properties of which boiling is one of? So what that the scale goes to 100 and you dont get the comfort that you are at ""100"" (%? 😂) all the time, it is LOGICALLY a FAAAR better choice than the Fahrenheit scale could and will ever be. And for what reasons does the body tempretature have to be at 100 ? I could draw up my own temperature scale and use 50 as my rulerpoint for the human body tempreture but what and why would I do that? Oh right, there is no single GOOD reason to use a deviating (or just a good guess/ as best as they could measure it value) as  a set point for a scale as important as a temperature scale, as temperature is by far one of the most important industrial measurement next to pressure. Which implies that having a scale ONLY ""defined"" by an everchanging heat source is to some degree just stupid. And exactly the reason why 100F are defined nowadays by that 37.77..° and NOT by some random dudes bodyheat. Need to produce some thermostats with a Fahrenheit scale? Just go and stick one in your mouth, just as good as Fahrenheit first did back then, GENIUS! That last joke is literally the ONLY good reason why someone on a far far away island could ever use the Fahrenheit scale as a ""good"" scale, provided he has no way of ever exchanging information with sane humans.
Taking all this in to account, and not trying to be an idiot, your point of ""comfort"" is completely unvalid in a world and time like ours where precision is a key factor in industry and our day to day lifes. 
So senõr Idiot, if you cant come up with scientific facts that prove a valid point and the ACTUAL benefits to the Fahrenheit scale that outweigh everything science has taught us in the last 2 centuries, then you are part of the problem why you yankees 🤪 still use it.

Vaccine passports, higher taxes, more socialism, etc. not saying all lgbtq people are aligning with these bad leftist values but many are. I could easily see why someone from another country would portray them as authoritarian or commie based on the politicians and policies many of them support. 

Speaking as someone with first hand experience. I have a gay roomate and he is so utterly sympathetic towards China, communism and socialism just because it isn’t democracy or capitalism that it is truly mind boggling. It’s as if he thinks communists and far leftists are sympathetic towards 🏳️‍🌈people in any way. Traitors to their country are usually the first ones thrown in the gulag when a country is taken over bc they have no honor and they can’t be trusted. 

It is truly odd how far leftists are trying to dress up their communist and pre-communist(socialist) movements in gay pride and BLM flags to get people to support their own rights being destroyed and given to the government. 

I think the ones in the U.S. think that democracy and capitalism is the worst thing ever because it is the only thing they have ever experienced and they are VERY uneducated on history. So out of spite for the few failings of their own country they opt for the next biggest thing which is communism and socialism. Without realizing the politicians they support could care less about them, their rights and will throw them in the garbage or forget about them as soon as they get the votes they need kinda like Biden/Kamala have done. 

It’s all about power. And if that side has to dress up communism and authoritarianism up in Lgbtq rainbows to get what they want then they will do that. They just need the left in America to veer a tiny bit further left to make it to that socialism then communism mark. With social media propaganda, censorship, and funding they are getting much closer and influencing a ton of gullible minds to hate their own countries in replace for something much worse.",2021-08-02 20:24:39

LOL, it definitely is:

🤣🤣🤣🤣

Now THAT got me! Sure it is the Ukrainian side that is incompetent... Not the russian side that (without any proves that it was a truck that even exploded) let a truck carrying, as you said, massive quantities of explosives detonate the bridge (thing is, there are countermeasures to verify that, and would believe that russians would have those countermeasures there in order to guarantee their bridge being secure).

>rejoice in terrorism..

1. Damage was made BELOW the bridge.

2. Even if a truck was there, a suicide mission isn't terrorism, as the main purpose of that was to destroy a bridge guaranteeing supplies to russian forces, not spread terror.

3. Don't come here with your BS after Russia did in Bucha",2022-10-08 14:12:02

n.

1.	the process by which one attributes one’s own individual negative characteristics, affects, and impulses to another person or group. This is often a defense mechanism in which unpleasant or unacceptable impulses, stressors, ideas, affects, or responsibilities are attributed to others

“Everyone who calls me out for being a bigot *is themselves a bigot*.” Give me a break dude.

I also think however reading and learning about shit like this is Hella interesting and that you should never take a black and white approach / view to shit like this.

mzk8mk,"The people are and have been oppressed and misinformed by state propaganda for decades. Have been living through totalitarian dictatorships, famines, countless wars, extreme poverty, corruption and ""communism"". Have been stripped of any capital, that means money, real estate, stocks and everything else and did not have the chance of acquiring anything since like 1900. 

Someone who was born and raised in the west in the last say 30 years can never understand how or what the average Russian thinks or wants.

But it's certainly not war or hate. Unfortunately though the common Russian people are weak and politically as well as economically completely uneducated.
Most of the people with capabilities, money, education, liberal views or anything in that regard fled from the sinking ship in the course of the last 100 years. What is left is the rest, who couldn't or wouldn't leave.

For example, the french people know how to do a riot, how to protest and how to get politics and law to follow the will of the people.

For example, the american average citizen knows how to deal with $. How to buy stocks, property, how to get rich and acquire capital.

The average russian citizen has no fucking clue and it is a shame.

You had to say something against a politician or a law or problems in your country? Jail! Gulag! The secret police can hear you!

You have capital? Money? Real estate? Nope I don't think you do, see, it is communism time my friend! 

And that's how it's been for the past 100 years.
Average russian people are not evil or want war or destroy anyone. Unfortunately though they are too passive and afraid to speak up, since they do not think they can change things NOW if they couldn't for the past century. And that's what they live by and that's how they raise their children. Not to draw any attention, not to speak up, save up money to leave to the West.

So please, don't hate us. It's sad that the words ""Russia"" and ""Putin"" are one and the same for most people. Really, a shame. We are more than 120 Million individuals and we achieved a lot in science and history. We had amazing artists, engineers, scientists and authors. The first bridges that can open up for ships to pass through a canal were invented by engineers in Saint Petersburg. First creatures and first humans in space, first super sonic airplane, nuclear aircrafts and submarines. Heck, the periodic table.We fought the Nazis and opened Auschwitz. NASA still buys Russian manufactured Rocket Parts for many of their rockets.

But there definitely are those who prattle on about free speech while ignoring some of the real-world realities in the US. Like yes, I technically do have the right to walk up to a police officer and say ""fuck the pigs"" in the US. But there's a reasonably high chance that if I do that, he'll get pissed and find some other reason to book me.

That said, germany (where I live) does have a couple of free speech things that annoy me -- like you can be fined for flipping off the speed limit enforcement cameras because it's Beamtenbeleidigung (insulting a public official).

It's not something I make a habit of, but I'd still like to have the right to do it! 😂",2020-07-01 19:00:24

I was living in Budapest at the time, so I put some serious thought into going there after I left Hungary. But man, what a great 5 day trip. Good food, excellent nightlife, peaceful strolls, beautiful architecture and views, hooked up with two beautiful girls, made friends with some guys at a bar who took me out a few nights. Even the train ride there was epic. 

My best friend and I stayed in a really nice apartment. But the apartment was super humid for some reason. Our towels wouldn’t even dry. My buddy ended up getting a bad skin rash on his face. The doctor asked him a million questions trying to figure out what could have caused it, and eventually concluded that the rash was from eating a girl out in the humid apartment, which caused a bacterial skin infection. He thought that he got an STD 😂 

Also, some friends of mine came to visit me in Budapest. They wanted to go to Vienna for a side trip. I took them to Timisoara instead. They were walking around like, “Where the fuck did you take us?!” Ended up having a lot of fun there, too.

""Enough is enough. #mittaontäysi  
EDIT: Turns out that further explanation is needed, especially for those who are not in the Finnish bubble 😉 Cultural & event professionals of all realms gathered today to Finnish Parliament to a demonstration titled ""enough is enough"". It was about many things. Corona, obviously, has walked all over us, and to top it off our left-leaning government couple weeks back announced huge cuts to funding for the arts in the coming couple of years.  
Our declaration with four statements on how to move forward was received by the culture minister and then politicians from different parties opened their mouths and made sounds like ""we have heard you"". So we'll see what comes next then.  
The whole ordeal was organized by a stellar team of arts professionals, and boy it was organized well. The idea was for everyone to stand still, dressed in black and with 2 m safety distance to each other, and stare our Parliament House down. It worked magically well. After the speeches were held, everything became quiet and people just stood their ground. Everyone had agreed to stay until 2pm – I think the program was done around half past one.  
Then someone in the back started clapping.  
And then we clapped for good 20 minutes - half an hour. For me personally it was a standing ovation to the farce that has been in play in the house we were facing and somewhat cathartic. What happens next remains to be seen, but today was a good day.""",2021-06-03 20:12:27

1at586b,"I’m a native Russian speaker, I don’t need the western media telling that what I’m hearing in Russian is not what I heard and the images I’m seeing are not what I saw.

Edit: I actually went through the article holy crap 🤣🤣🤣

> The 2007 video entitled ""People is for pistols' legalization"", which RT interprets as a comparison of Caucasians with cockroaches and a call to kill them, is in fact an agitation for the legalisation of short-barreled firearms, another point in the movement People's manifesto. It says that slippers help against flies and cockroaches, and a pistol is needed against ""homosapiens arbitrarius"". The meaning of the statement is clear: weapons are required to protect against criminals. There are no words about Muslims, Caucasians or any other representatives of other ethnic or religious groups. Arms are suggested to be used only in response to initial aggression of some armed criminals.

> The fact that the video is still available online suggests that the Russian authorities did not see in it “calls for the murder of Muslims,” otherwise it would have been blocked and Navalny brought to justice. It is impossible to ""call for the murder of Muslims"" in Russia with impunity.

I love how people see racist dog whistles everywhere in the west, but a man who openly spoke about immigrants, has a woman in burqa in the video, and says immigrants need to be deported in a different video manages to get away because he didn’t openly state the word “Muslims”. Ffs. Mental gymnastics are crazy

Also, Kamik Galeev isn’t pro-Putin? I don’t know him well, but from what I’ve read he’s very critical of Putin",2024-02-17 19:57:43

America and Germany were the only nations fighting the war on two fronts. The Pacific theater weakened the ability of Japan and Germany to coordinate as allies. By being in the Pacific, America also prevented Japan from not only controlling oil and rubber supplies for themselves, but sending any materials to Germany to bolster their war effort.

The Simpsons has a great joke about this: 
Moe to British man: ""we saved your ass in WW2!!""
Brit to Moe: ""well, we saved your arse in WW3!""

sm63ve,Could we respect the fact that it took multiple countries to defeat Germany. What the fuck were the Germans eating to put up such a fight! 🤯,2022-02-07 09:36:12
sm63ve,"Very simple to explain.

Britain was an enemy to Nazi Germany from the beginning of the war until the end as well as fighting the majority of WW2 across two continents, their only objective was to fight Nazi Germany on all fronts with the eventual invasion of Europe to reclaim European countries.

Russia was an ally to Nazi Germany and literally threw unarmed bodies (millions) to defend itself and nothing else. With little skill, thought or consideration for its own people, or that of any other nation. They as a people had no understanding of what the Nazis were or what was going on around the world. Just all of a sudden theres germans here to slaughter us.

Americans joined the war for financial gain and sent men across when they realised they could win, not before. And literally their entire military was being used by the British army to fight the Germans. 

The answer - All the nation's contributed to the End of the Nazi regime. But only 1 nation fought the ultimate war against the Nazis, in all aspects with the sole intention of destroying the Nazis. No more. No less.

Propaganda is to have been taught otherwise.

The French wouldn't admit the British if their lives depended on it, which is proven when they surrendered and refused to allow us to use their Navy.. they would rather let Germans use it against us. 

Another example.. the US were left to their own devices in the Pacific and we know how that went. Barely inhabited islands taking years to invade with eventually having to drop WMD's 🤦🏻‍♂️",2022-02-07 09:30:10

dsuvkm,No way! I used to be travel editor there. Great little student paper 🐽,2019-11-07 16:34:09
dsuvkm,">You have to work to get student money?

If you're an EU citizen, yes. Danish people get the help without working (although many do). I forgot to say that you get paid for working, as well. So the government money is on top of what you earn working. I didn't think I had to say that... And wages start at 18€/$20 per hour for unskilled labour.

>Wouldn't it be better to let the students focus on their studies and maybe track the progress of the studies to see if they have actually earned the benefit? 

Well, that's why the minimum is 11 hours a week. That's about one and a half 8-hour shifts per week. Also, you aren't allowed to earn more than ~1800€/mo. (~80 hours worked) So basically you're allowed a full time job for half the month.

Living costs so I can put it all into perspective. I live in a decent sized apartment and share with one guy. I pay 450€/mo. rent, inclusive of all utilities and internet. There are cheaper places too, where the rent can be 250-300€. I spend another 450-500/mo. on food and entertainment. I go out often, I eat good food and like to drink nice alcohol. So I'm definitely not living frugally and my total expenses for the month come out to 1000€/mo. I make that working a part time warehouse job where I work 6 hour shifts (30 min break). So basically the money I get from the government goes into savings.

Wanna hear something else? After I graduate I'm gonna get ~1500€ from my union until I find a job in my field/degree. This is called A-kasse. I'm allowed to reject 3 job offers and they pay this for up to two years. So if I find a job in 3 months, I'll have 21 months of A-kasse left. So in theory I can quit my job whenever, go back on A-kasse until I find another one.

You can also get A-kasse by paying around 50€/mo. into a union. After a full year of working, you're entitled to a year of A-kasse. How much you get depends on how much you earned at your job, the ~1500€/mo. is the minimum for lowest paying jobs or those who just graduated university.

1. a movement for (originally) the re-establishment and (now) the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel. It was established as a political organization in 1897 under Theodor Herzl, and was later led by Chaim Weizmann.

So here's a definition of Zionism. Is it fair to say that if you think Israel should exist you're a zionist and if you don't think Israel should exist you're an anti-zionist?",2019-11-07 21:24:46

From [Qataris own more of London than the Queen](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/03/17/qataris-london-queen/) to

[Qatar provides nearly all the UK's LNG. It comes through the South Hook Terminal at Milford Haven, which is 67.5% owned by Qatar Petroleum. Then there are the strategic stakes in some of the country's biggest corporate names. The QIA has bought 22% of Sainsbury's and 20% of London Heathrow Airport. Since July last year, Qatar Airways is the biggest shareholder in British Airways owner IAG, with a 20% stake.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40192970)

Hence why they can 🇶🇦 get away with blatant **state sponsoring of terrorism **
[According to official US Committee on Foreign Affairs, Qatar has been known to be a permissive environment for terror financing, reportedly funding U.S. designated foreign terrorist organizations, such as Hamas, Al qaeda and ISIS, as well as several extremist groups operating in Syria. At least one high-ranking Qatari official provided support to the mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks against our country, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad.](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-115hhrg26427/html/CHRG-115hhrg26427.htm)",2022-11-23 14:31:23

z2pde5,"Forgive me, I don't think it's all that weird. Qatar 🇶🇦 strategically has  bought out most of the political elite in both US and major European states ( Note the silence of Biden 🇺🇸 administration to Macron 🇫🇷 almost defiant support of Qatar ).

That simply occurs because both of them plus states like England have had strategically assets owned by Qatar from The biggest club and billions in French military contracts to wide swathes of British property and Airways and London Airport.

I won't even mention the strategic base of US: Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest American military outpost in the Middle East.

There's zero chance that US or big players in Europe ( UK, France) ever do anything to antagonize the terrorist and dictatorial regime in Qatar 🇶🇦. The interdependence is too vast and too strategic for anyone to call Qatar out. 

Heck there was even an official congress briefing highlighting the double crossing by Qatar 🇶🇦 but to no avail.

z2pde5,"Thanks for highlighting it, I just find it intriguing how Macron for all his work to fight against radical islamist terrorism acts so docile to the biggest funder of state sponsor of terrorism ( Qatar 🇶🇦 literally funds every known terrorist entity from Muslim Brotherhood, taliban, Hamas to Al qaeda).

What's interesting is its not even really trade that Qatar focuses on, they strategically only focus on buying critical pieces in influential Europe and US without any focus on trade. ( I doubt they care all that much if their rental properties in London turn a profit).

I'd also humbly disagree that they have built any sort of soft power, you won't find Qatar 🇶🇦 even as a tourist destination for most footballers in Middle East. ( its Dubai instead) 
Neither do they produce anything which is consumed or shared by wide populace in all of Europe.
What they are developing in the investing power ( something a bridge between Soft and hard power). It's built on proxies and funding terrorism and Islamic extremism.",2022-11-23 15:12:16

m2mcc1,"I was in highschool when this happened. I remember a couple of our teachers couldn't make it to class that day, because they travelled through that station to get to our school. It was pure luck that the explosions happened before they reached the station.

Spain has been pretty divided on politics since I can remember, but right after the attack we all joined together and went out to the streets to denounce the terrorists, and show them we were not afraid. But it didn't last long. The lies from the government and other conspiracies split us right back. We should be remembering the victims instead of fighting about politics.

If only...

Solve the issue of religious extremism, of any stripe, and you solve the first part of the problem. 

Solve the root cause of people having to flee their countries (foreign policy of other nations/domestic policy there) and  try to assimilate in countries that reject, demean, etc. them and that’ll address another part.

hqakh0,"I don't think that (the first part) is necessarily true. I've heard from a Polish friend a couple of times that phrases like ""that wouldn't happen in Germany"" or ""Germany does that better"" are pretty common when something goes a bit wrong on Poland. But most of the time (I actually don't have an example right now. I think delays of trains was one of them? Or infrastructure?) but most of the time those things are just as ""bad"" here as they are in Poland.

From what I've heard, you guys have been making amazing strides forward both on a societal level and in terms of infrastructure. Like, he told me he had to regularly bribe homeless people to not break his car. Like, they come over when he parks and say ""Should we watch your car so nothing happens to it?"" and if you don't pay them they broke his car. That didn't happen for years now, he says. He showed me google maps locations where you see in the 2008 version of streetview a giant ran down concrete block that is now a fancy office building.

From what he tells me, Poland seems to improve a lot (he's from Lodz if that matters) and I'm sure just like how people would now draw the ""border"" between eastern and western Europe at the western border of Poland, they will in the not so distant future draw that ""border"" at the eastern border of Poland.

You guys are doing pretty well. If I'd change one thing it would be more support for countries like Poland and Czechia so that we get the weaker EU member states on the same level as the stronger member states for a stronger Union in total. Even if that would require a much higher financial burden on us.

Poland is a great country and I feel like you can be very proud of the progress you've made. You don't need to be annexed by Germany to achieve greatness. You're on your way to achieve that yourselves. 🥰",2020-07-13 08:53:53

6wbg4i,"There isn't, BBC BASIC II didn't have SLEEP/WAIT/SLUMBER. What you did is very much correct, and the only way we had back in the day do do manual delays.

I perused the [full manual of BBC BASIC II](http://bbc.nvg.org/doc/BBCUserGuide-1.00.pdf), and indeed there's no such thing as a WAIT/SLEEP command.

There was another much hackier way, whcih was to play a sound of the amount of time we wanted, but with a very low (or very high) pitch, that's not audible by the human ear, e.g. <20 Hz or >20 kHz and/or zero volume, for example:

    SOUND 1, 0, 0, 20 
    REM First parameter is the channel, no need to change this
    REM Second parameter is the volume, 0 is muted, -15 is max
    REM (I know...)
    REM Third parameter is the pitch. It doesn't matter for delays
    REM The last parameter (20) means one second,
    REM 1 means 0.05 seconds, etc.

 I never doubt your intention as it's the ideal short term solution but it will not just lead to a alienated country but also to a country that has no real power on it's own: you're making your country a playball in the big game while we have the chance to create a superpower on your own right now and in max 10-20 years the chance will be gone.

The real enemy of your immigrant problem is the modern capitalism made in USA™... Well that really takes too long. But we can't fight a standard the world agreed on so we have to be better at the game but none of us will stand a chance on their own...

b5ox1r,"So, basically, from what i've read, this will happen in the next few years (>2):

* every EU country will need to come up with its own legislation to comply, in the next 2 years. I expect many abuses of power to stifle online political opposition in some backwards EU countries, like it happened with the muddy GDPR legislation in mine: you take an EU law that's ripe for interpretation and abuse, and shape it so it helps your nefarious political ways.

* less competition for the tech giants (which happen to be non-EU, mostly from US). Let's say i want to build a imgur competitor. I don't have money to built ""competent"" filters that even Google can't make them work correctly, so i have to rely on human filters. But once my site grows large enough, my hired human powered censoring machines can't keep up with the upload rates, so i'm fucked.

* let's say i'm the owner of a small forum for model building, and one of the users posts an image of a Star Wars™ space ship as inspiration for his starship model. As an owner and moderator, should i delete the pic, not to risk a copyright strike? Or should i risk and wait and see if anyone bothers with a claim? Theoretically, the pic should be under fair usage, but if google's youtube has big problems with abuse from copyright holders, what chances do i have? 

It's such a piece of shit legislation and i'm absolutely disgusted by it. EU should be for the people, not for corporations. People first, consumers first, corporations second. Corporations are not people, they are money making, soulless machines that would do *literally* anything for profit, if they could.

When corruption and bureaucracy starts to affect the laws EU gives, then we have a problem. I'm still for EU, always will be, but ffs, EU needs some big internal reforms, or things will go worse. It's no wonder voters are searching for alternatives. ",2019-03-26 15:01:41

It is my view that the more neutral countries the better. While WW2 was a conflict for bare survival of the peoples of Europe, this conflict is not. Even nations with powerful friends were steamrolled quickly.

I totally understand why Finland would join NATO, being bordered by Russia. The Baltic countries as well (being small and defenseless).

Why Sweden? Sweden was never de facto threatened by Russia, attacking Sweden would be a costly choice for Russia, hell even Hitler avoided Sweden! Now, Sweden has signed it's mobilization papers if war does break out and has become a target for Russian nukes.

Sweden would've prospered by developing their own nuclear program and staying neutral. Yugoslavia would've survived doing that as well.",2024-02-26 23:45:03

1b0kue2,"I am staying on topic. You said Turkey is unreliable because they're playing both sides in Ukraine (That's literally what France did, but in Libya) and helps dictator(?) Azerbaijan sell their gas. France helped a dictator too? You're furious because your own logic can be applied to your own country. 

Then you said Turkey is not strong, which is genuinely funny.

Your last point was: Turkey doesn't have any allies. And you thought the root of that problem was Turkey, when I pointed out that it's not unknown that PKK has been supported by Europeans, and the US for decades. PKK is a direct national security problem of Turkey and them supporting PKK (because they help fight ISIS🥺) undermines Turkey's trust. Turkey's downing of the Russian Jet after it entered the Turkish Airspace ensued with the German and the US Patriot Missions fleeing, leaving Turkish airspace defenceless (Turkish air defence systems sucked ass at the time)

Turkey shouldn't be friendly towards Russia, there you i said it! But i'm almost certain that you wouldn't do the same to France's involvement in Libya.


You do not recognize or allow for criticism of France’s own misdeeds in Libya.

French interventionism and interference in domestic Libyan affairs go back decades—to the 1940s when France tried to take and keep control of the southern Libyan province of Fezzan, where it had economic and military interests. 

Kept at bay by the regime of Moammar Gadhafi for more than forty years, France, in 2011 under President Nicolas Sarkozy, seized the chance offered by the first revolts in Benghazi to recover its long-lost position in Libya by immediately siding with the rebels. 

Paris soon became the most intransigent power in international efforts to foster negotiations between the Gadhafi regime and the leadership of the revolutionaries. 

From the beginning of the conflict, France was obviously in favor of NATO’s intervention in Libya leading to regime change. The result of this policy is visible: What has ensued is almost ten years of conflict and social distress.

Having completely failed in its attempts to control and guide the Libyan revolution in the direction it desired, France de facto withdrew from the North African country by the end of 2012.

France then returned in late 2014 when, partially to gain credit with its most important defence-industry client, the United Arab Emirates, it threw its weight behind the Egyptian- and UAE-sponsored warlord Khalifa Haftar, a former Gadhafi-era general who defected in the late 1980s. 

Despite France’s official claims to the contrary, [French troops were present in Libya](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/21/libyan-civil-war-france-uae-khalifa-haftar/) training and assisting Haftar's forces. The [crash](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36843186) of a French military helicopter near Benghazi in 2016, which killed three members of France’s special-operations forces, provided solid evidence confirming what until then were only rumors of French involvement.

The crash exposed France’s hypocrisy: While Paris’s official policy supported the United Nations-led negotiations over Libya and the Government of National Accord (GNA) that resulted from them, France’s real policy on the ground was of total and full support for Haftar’s forces.

With similar ambiguity, France [tacitly endorsed all the military campaigns of Haftar's Libyan National Army,](https://www.politico.eu/article/frances-double-game-in-libya-nato-un-khalifa-haftar/) including the LNA’s attack against Tripoli and bombing of its civilian population and infrastructure, which included the targeting of [hospitals and health facilities.](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/4/7/un-condemns-rocket-attack-on-tripoli-hospital)

When forces loyal to the GNA found [missiles and other weaponry belonging to France](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/world/middleeast/us-missiles-libya-france.html) after the precipitous retreat of the LNA from the previously occupied city of Gharian, about sixty miles south of Tripoli, French officials were forced to make unconvincing excuses to explain the embarrassing situation.

Not only did France not cease its military support for Haftar, but it actually increased its diplomatic engagement with him. French President Emmanuel Macron [invited](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-france-split-on-libya-as-khalifa-haftar-strikes-tripoli/a-48449352) the Libyan general to summits, international conferences, and private meetings, where Macron made a point to welcome Haftar with all honors. Macron thus made sure that Haftar would be de facto legitimized, despite his poor [human-rights record](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/16/libya-apparent-war-crimes-tripoli) and recognized as an essential part of any solution to the Libyan crisis.

In 2020, French officials have focused their energies on scapegoating Turkey for the situation in Libya. In particular, their claim that Turkish intervention in the Libyan conflict makes it harder to realize a negotiated solution should be questioned. Without Turkish intervention, the Russian and Sudanese mercenaries that constitute a sizeable portion of the LNA would have overwhelmed the resistance of the Tripoli forces and invaded the city, causing innumerable casualties. There was no hope of negotiations at that point. So, the UN would not be able to solve the conflict peacefully(like you said, the UN was trying to solve it peacefully) if Turkey didn't intervene. Nobody in Libya will forget that France was idly standing by while Haftar approached.

My point is, if Turkey is unreliable for playing boths sides in a conflict then France is unreliable for playing both sides in Libya. 
Idc if it's whataboutism, i'm using your logic.

""PKK has legitimate reason to exist""
I do not care even IF they do, I'm not going to listen to what you have to say about the PKK because my grandparents and other older family members experienced the atrocities caused by the PKK first-hand (We used to live in Southeastern Turkey before we moved after the earthquake in February last year, I'm half Kurdish & half Turkish.) My grandpa's childhood friend from elemantary school who became a police officer was killed by the PKK, mind you he was a Kurd. Our family members told us about so many things about the things PKK did, which i'm not going to bother typing. This was in Southeastern Turkey, where the majority of the population was(/is) Kurdish. PKK's main enemy isn't even Turkey. PKK thinks Kurds who don't want independence are traitors and makes them suffer the most. That's why PKK fought against police officers, soldiers, government officials in Turkey that were ethnically Kurdish. PKK caused us Kurds more harm than good.

https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/s/Ki4UEUJScm


Turkish Imperialism? How is it even relevant? I strongly oppose Neo-Ottomanism just for the record. But in all seriousness PKK has nothing to do with Turkish Imperialism. Kurds were promised independence when the Ottoman Empire collapsed, which then Turkey captured back. We Kurds fought side by side the Turks against France, the UK, Armenia, Greece and Italy in the Turkish war of independence.

Do you also like bringing up imperialism while debating with Americans?",2024-03-08 18:52:47

t2te6z,"I've had training with the AT4 at several occasions. Not a single one of them has been without an old officer making his best effort to make sure we never (NEVER) attempt to fire one at a MBT. Fighting vehicles and lighter armoured vehicles are fair game, but the chances of knocking out a tank is too low to be worth it. You would not want to be near an agitated tank...

While I'm at it, it's usually recommended to fire 4-6 AT4s at once agains every target, since 50% shots are usually misses in a stressed out scenario and 2-3 hits are usually required to take out a fighting vehicle. So don't expect thousands of knocked out vehicles. A few hundred though! 💪",2022-02-27 21:16:41

But it doesn't matter, that's the bottom line. Take this statement for example.

And it was probably an average because it is cheaper in most places because the prices depends where you buy it in France. (I’m French btw)
Like even in Paris, from one neighborhood to other the price of the bread can vary by 10 to 30% (nowadays at least), and I’m always reminded of how Paris is really expensive compared to anywhere else in France when I got out of the town.

If you want an idea, I buy a baguette for 1€ most places in Paris, and when I’m in the south the price drops to 0.40/0.60€.

I’m also pretty sure that the reason why people ate so much bread in the 1900 was because it is cheap and filling.

I mean, on a good day I can have 2 baguettes with ham and/or cheese when I don’t feel like cooking. (Cliché do come from somewhere haha 😅)

Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and everyone else in North, South, or Central America. You all love to hate on ""Americans"" so much yet your all so damn ignorant. So full of hate. Smh, look in the mirror.

Also, if their pathetic false flag attacks by the FSB in Transnistria were not enough (One video of the RPG attack shows the FSB agents dropping the 3 RPG launchers on the floor before driving away, they're not the smartest or most subtle at planting [fake evidence](https://boingboing.net/2022/04/27/russian-fsb-agents-confuse-the-sims-with-sim-cards-in-alleged-nazi-evidence-plant.html)):

I vividly remember a meeting with a few young socdems, we drank a few beer and each shared their most “unleft”/controversial opinion. For some reason the chick who said “abortion should be stricter regulated” and the chick who said “police is insanely helpful and should actually get more rights” got less weird stares than me saying “nuclear is a green energy source and we should go back to it instead of burning coal and gas”

He's protected his position as well as he can but to make it clear you're going to hold power until you die just means someone decides you have to die. He's shaped the new Russia and if prudent will step aside to allow others to fight for that spot, which there are multiple figures more than happy to do.

They *are* ""more native"" to their lands than other scandinavians! They are only inside those borders *because* of colonization in the first place.

So, with that squared away - that in turn means, Russia thinks it’s fine to just call a vote and run it in a foreign land. Or else he’d have to ask Kyiv to organize it. Again, check ✅

Thus, my recommendation is the following;

Allow Japan to organize and run an election on the Kirili islands to be part of Japan.

Allow Finland to organize and run an election in Karelen.

Allow X, to organize an election in Y Russian territory, etc. Thats a fair play I think",2022-09-21 12:05:51

ozw5h6,"Learning french as a second language was quite easy as a Romanian  kid. I always knew Romanian and Italian read almost the same (ce ci ge gi che chi ghe ghi)
But as i learn more and more Italian and spanish, it never stops to amaze me how many words are similar and how their meanings vary little or lots or how some are archaic or obsolete in one but not in the other 🤗
Happened alot with french. I hear a new word or a very uncommon word that other kids my age dont usually know even if its their mother tongue, but i know cuz its commonly used in romania. And vive versa.
Also my family name has a diphtong and people here always had a hard time. But if i do the italian finger thingy and exagerate the accent a bit to make it sound italian, its ppl insta get it and its always fun 🤩",2021-08-08 02:44:37

ozw5h6,"Romanian is only 10% slavic and 10% other languages while still being 80% latin and it actually is the closest language to latin in grammar so you have slavic words that get murdered by latin grammar. Spanish is 83% latin, Italian is 90% so Romanian is the third closest language. I get that our pozition on the map is weird but you have internet today so why this ignorance? 😅",2021-08-08 05:36:07

tablzn,"Spotted in the twitter thread, a historical analysis of 19th Russia in the region

 Crimean War 1853-1856 - a 🧵: Tzar claims jurisdiction over Christians (Ukrainians) in the Holy Land & Crimea (Lugansk, Donetsk & Crimea). Austro-Hungary (Russian empire's ""allies""), Turkey, France & England unite against the Tsar. How did things go? 

""This unexpected weakness of Russia in military matters arises from four concurring causes, of which three are inherent in her system, and,
if nof absolutely incurable, are at best little likely to be cured. First,..."" 


""...the first place, the nature of the country and the want of roads. Her resources may be vast, but they are scattered and remote. Her forces may be immense, but they are necessarily in great measure distant from the scene of action..."" 

""Secondly. The Russian armies are often armies on paper only. Not only are their numbers far fewer than are stated in official returns & paid for out of the official purse, but they are noto-iously ill-provided w everything necessary to the effective action of a soldier..."" 


""..,The colonels of regiments & officers of the commissariat have a direct interest in having as large a number on the books and as small a number in the field as possible, inasmuch as they pocket the pay and rations of the difference between these figures...""

""... This will explain why the vast armies ... which were announced as on their march to the Danube nearly a year ago, never reached that river at all; why of the 150k or 200k men who, we are told, occupied the Principalities, more than 70,000 ever could be got together;...""


""... and why we only find 50,000 troops in the Crimea, though nine months since it was proclaimed that reinforcements to the number of 70,000 had been ordered thither. The fuct is, that thousande die or fall sick on the road; thousands more lag behind or desert...""


""...every pair of shoes or great coat intercepted from the wretched soldier is a bottle of champagne for the ensign or major; every ammunition waggon which is paid for by Government, but not provided, is a handsome addition to the salary of the captain or the contractor...""


""...This horrible and fatal system originates in ... Russian autocracy...Then the power of the Autocrat, absolute as it is and vigorously as it is exercised,

And I know what I see every day. As for blondes and red haired: Let's not forget, that a hundred years ago, there were 10 languages spoken on Hungarian soil and they were all European. There are whole villages with Danubian Swabs or Transsylvanian Saxons. And they are Germanic (nordic) tribes. And Romeo meets Juliet and the rest is none of our business... ;-)

Whatever... I just wanted to give opposition to the guy, who pretends, we are not European, because we are not blond and blue eyed. Europe is *not* being *nordic*. Nordic is being nordic.  And the nordic regions are that part of Europe, that lies north. How someone wants to set this as *typical* European is beyond my understanding.",2017-12-04 12:40:19

jhgffo,"Good post.
 
I agree that it is irresponsible to have sex at all if you are not prepared to deal with the consequenses, but to be crass about a tough topic and continue the dialectics... since we should not forcefully sterilize undesirable parents*, isn't abortion then the option that means the least suffering, and therefore the morally correct choice from a utilitarian point of view? The irresponsible person wont raise an unwelcome child and the child will not have to be born to an unloving parent, or parents.

Counter-argument: Adoption exists.

Counter-counter argument: There's not enough people willing to or able to adopt meaning a surplus of discarded children and there's lots of research in the topic, that shows that it isn't unproblematic - adoption is a risk factor for mental health issues and antisocial behaviours (just as growing up with a single parent de facto is).

*) Letting a government decide who is and is not wanted is a slippery slope to forced sterilization and euthanasia programs so the woman's right to choose seems like the best option to me. So, for now, my personal opinion remains that the free choice means the best outcome for the most which benefits everyone - the collective as well as individuals... because what is quantity of life really worth if there's no life quality, and if all the odds are in ones disadvantage?

Please note: I don't have the final answer to this or anything, so please don't think that I am disagreeing with you. I just wanted to keep spinning on your balanced and thought-provoking post. 👍",2020-10-25 13:48:45

Listen. This isn't any special case in history. Not the first war, not the first energy crisis, not the first recession, there is not even bad inflation (yet). This will blow over, there will be another crisis in the future. And another. And so on.
If Netherlands is doing that, well, good for you, but I hope that doesn't happen in Finland. It would just bring whole host on additional problems... Where that money is coming from? More loans? Is that one time thing or should state just pay some sum each month? For how long? How about people who were poor already, before all this? Why didn't they get additional funding?

If they force entrepreneurs to lower prices, what about their compensations? What about food prices, electricity prices? Force those too to lower their prices? For how long, and based on what exactly? How is that impacting the image of Finland to other companies not yet here?

They gave everything they had in an attempt to lower her credibility. Again, my point was that we were lucky to get a strong leader at a time when the whole country was completely ruined by the great recession, we could've easily slipped into corrupt populist darkness at that point. This was all back in the early 2010s so the whole gender-politics debate wasn't a whole thing as it is now. We simply cared about getting out of the mess that surrounded us.
In regards to the standard of living here in Lithuania, now 10 years later the situation is astoundingly better. Back then people used to migrate from Lithuania en masse, now people from other countries immigrate TO Lithuania looking for a better life, as well as those who come back to a whole different country after a long time abroad (myself included).

lbkm8l,"No, there's all sorts of weird shit going on concerning Russia in these conspiracy theories.

For example, all of the death camps were in USSR-controlled territory after the war (I don't even know if that is true, it's just what has been stated to me). 

A common theory in these communities is that the USSR was secretly controlled by Jews who fabricated death camps in order to control the global narrative post-war. 

Of course Stalin purged the USSR of Jewish influence in the state and industries the decade before that, so the idea that perhaps the second most anti-semitic state in that era was pushing a big Jewish conspiracy is bollocks. 

There's probably a Russian nesting doll of Judeo-Soviety conspiracy theories and the Great Terror was another Jewish Trick™ but I the person I was talking to on Telegram called me a ""zionist golem"" for critiquing him and deleted the chat.

l8f4ym,"As a contemporary architect, I appreciate their contribution but their buildings are sculptures and should be seen as such.

The fact aside that I would find it overwhelming to live in a city consisting of lots of those designs  (and ignoring the fact that most city quarters are underwhelming, too) it is hard enough to make people build in straight lines. Can you imagine what laying water pipes in a building like that must be like 😁

But whatever the technical and coordination issues, when I ask a client, should I make this a round corner. It looks cool but you'll lose 25% of the floor space and can't put any regular furniture there a and it'll cost 2000 € more they'll nope out.

In any case, Hundertwasser wasn't a feelgood guy. He wanted to provoke and shake things up. He was a guy who made naked painting happenings in the 60s. He said you need to give your new washing machine a hard kick to dent it, so it would become an individual item. He demanded of legislators to allocate a set percentage of ""tree renters"" in each building and give all regular renters in all buildings the right to paint the facade around their windows however they liked as far as their paintbrush would reach. He became an environmental activist towards the end of his life.

ifkirr,"I grew up in Canada, my family is Ukrainian, and I went to a Ukrainian Catholic elementary school. I remember listening to the news that day, my family jumping up and down with excitement at the breakfast table, my grandparents called us, they had already spoken to their brothers and sisters in Sambir and Lviv and they were all very, very happy and excited about their independence and hoped it would bring them fortune and opportunity. The whole day at school that day was a celebration, we made posters and decorations, we held a parade. The principal also brought in hundreds of balloons and we each wrote a wish for the future that we attached to the balloon and released them during the celebration. 

Less then six months later my grandparents went back to Ukraine, the first time since running for their lives away from their homeland during WWII. It was a changed country, nothing looked familiar, but they had a chance to visit with their families, their brothers and sisters that they hadn't seen since 1939, met nieces and nephews and their children. It was a sad trip, their families lived in poverty, some of their homes had no electricity, they sold what they could, but prices for basic goods skyrocketed when the borders opened. My grandparents came home with empty luggage, they may have even left their luggage behind, only bringing home their passports and medications in their pockets; they had left everything behind for their families to sell, including their video camera that they had bought to record their trip. They never went back, but were finally allowed to send gifts to their family, and they sent clothes and money back as often as they could. My grandparents were not well off, my grandfather was a janitor, my grandmother cleaned churches and temples, but they had more than their families in Ukraine.


29 years later, and the people of Ukraine are still hoping for opportunity and fortune to come from their independence.

11itvj2,"Thank you for all the info, very interesting 🤗

Though, I still do believe such revolutions are impossible 😅 I've encountered too many selfish people to believe that they would be capable to cooperate and self govern themselves. 

Moreover, when I was talking about ""laws"" I wasn't mainly thinking about the usual ones (don't steal, don't kill etc), but rather all those linked to public sanity, product safety etc.

In an Anarchic country, I can't see how the medicine or products to eat could be regulated to assure their safety. I simply cannot trust individual people.

Sure, it's also true that a lot of ""selfish"" people act like that because of money, so maybe if we would remove them they wouldn't have the thrive anymore? But still, to me it seems so innate the human desire to achieve power and an higher position than those around etc... (obviously not talking about all humans).",2023-03-06 08:05:48

It’s the same strip malls, grocery stores, fast food joints, and gas stations. The whole country is a parking lot. 

On top of this is a capitalist dystopia where the rich run everything and the lower classes are saddled with suboptimal paying jobs with stagnant wages along massive debt due to our lack of universal healthcare and grotesquely expensive colleges. I’m personally $60,000 in student debt.

My theory is that because in spring we got locked down so quickly, pretty harsh restrictions out of nowhere even tho the numbers were one of the best in Europe, people thought that it will get better.. but now they are closing schools, pubs etc. again so people are probably tired of it. I am not trying to justify it btw, it's ignorant. On top of that our government is so fucked up right now, did basically nothing the whole time just confused general public (hell even Belgium is getting themselves some functioning government for this crisis!) one day saying this, the next day something completely different.. and the naturally skeptical nature of Czechs is just a cherry on top. The good thing is those numbers are mainly in the younger parts of population.

If they want to sell tax free in the uk, they will need an hq here too.

What do you think all the eu based companies that wish to continue selling in the uk tariff free will do? That's right sausage, they set up a UK hq.

You are using project fear to silence genuine concerns.

>short term uncertainty will cause short term issues with the economy

Oh, you're right, we should stick to a system that half the country hates because no one can imagine living more than a year into the future, we should give up our freedoms and liberty, because enforcing those rights might be tricky.

1btrgde,"Here's a wild thought, Money isn't real! It's a form of control and we all think that our lives require it (to some degree we do, because taxes!) and the more we get, the more we want and if we can't have it we'll invadr another country to get more stuff to sell to other foreign powers or wait for the US to declare war on someone and head in to the fire first. 

The thing is prior to the monetary system being created we used to barter for stuff, we grew a lot of our own food, or raised animals to put meat in our bellies, we crushed our own fruit to make our beverages or we bought people to do it for us.

Now to get ""money"" all the government has to do is file a request with the monarchy, if the monarchy approves they send a stamped royal letter to the Bank of England who negotiates what they want in return which is always based on debt, then if the government accepts the proposal (which they do 95% of the time), the BoE sends a production quota to the mint, the mint does its part of the job, then the funds get added to a handwritten ledger and a computer system somewhere in the greater London area, then the funds are divided up as needed, but where did that money come from in the first place? The BoE has no assets. The currency isn't backed by any tangible existing item like the dollar used to be backed by gold. Now, just like Britain, it's backed by bugger all, and if your already in debt to the BoE (for 2.7 trillion as of Q3 2023), where do the government get the money to pay the interest off on the loan the BoE just gave them? 🤔 

They increases the interest rate and stagnate your tax code so if you do happen to get a decent pay bump you'll end up paying a ton more tax than the previous year usually outpacing the interest rate so your technically making a net loss for the same work you did last year, Welcome to UK 🇬🇧",2024-04-02 09:47:26

3. Lower income taxes (in fact lower them all). Once we stop wasting money, we can actually lower taxes for people so they have more money in their pockets to spend. 

4. Lower corporation tax. Probably an unpopular opinion but look at any country in the world where they support lower taxes (especially for businesses). The companies make more profits and create a more competitive market place which equates to higher wages. I find it quite bizarre how we want to push big businesses away from the U.K. with higher taxes. The U.K is becoming more and more unattractive for businesses and investors. If you lower corporation tax you’d also encourage more people to start businesses. 

5. Eliminate illegal immigration and put a cap on legal migration. I don’t know why this one is always controversial. More people into our small island puts more strain on public services and lowers wages for U.K. born citizens. The evidence is already there but if you need to look at other countries look at any European country that previously opened their borders to any refugee or immigrant. Their economies went down the toilet over time and their public services with it. Now many of these countries are doing massive u-turns and refusing any refugees and making migration more difficult. Germany, Italy, Sweden, Poland, Hungary, U.K. So many examples to name a few. 

Now is there anything the U.K. citizens can do anything about this right now? Fuck no. Who is there to vote for? The conservatives who everyone claims are right leaning, are the most left leaning “right wing” party that exists. Then you have the far left Labour Party who’ll probably make things way worse and a bunch of crap below them. 

Hopefully a party pops up soon that has the citizens best interests at heart. I won’t hold my breath for the short term though 😅",2024-04-02 19:40:51

11p7vey,"""Zurek"" is a very nice (rye-flour I think?) soup with egg and sausage in it. Zurek w Chlebie take it to a whole 'nother level by serving it in a hollowed out loaf of bread sometimes with a dipping sauce which is very tasty and filling.

""Barszcz z Uszkami"" (meaning beetroot soup with little ears) is very tasty soup especially on a cold day and it has little dumplings in it. 

There are many others like Rosol (chicken and noodle soup) which is a favourite of mine. In my opinion Poland is the world leader of soups. 👍",2023-03-12 18:08:12

- My point was that we have been attacked on US soil, against US citizens, as an act of war. And when that has happened, we defend ourselves.

And I can’t believe that people in world don’t think Pearl Harbor wasn’t an act of war. Their military, crippled ours, totally unprovoked. 🤷‍♂️",2020-05-24 13:58:28

Totally. It’s devastating. The buildings, art, heritage lost is SO FAR beyond what happened to the US. EVER.

Our country is new, and I’ve seen the cathedrals and building in Germany and through Europe and marveled that they are older than our entire counties entire existence... they somehow made it through the wars.

I was just saying, the US hasn’t always been starting wars. We’ve been attacked here on our soil, or provoked, or asked to join in wars.

(We’ve gotten a bad rap for starting wars since Iraq and it’s not unfounded, I get it. But history shows resistance to get involved in world wars. That’s all I was saying.)

Can we stop fighting? Please? :) I wasn’t trying to start a war here.

Take a look at this, the US is responsible for *twice* as much emissions since its founding than China, 25% of *all* CO2 emissions by mankind 

If we create a consumer world for us we cant expect that the rest of the planet doesn’t care about it and keeps rural … its our fault that the rest of the world wants the same standards as us and it’s their good right, if we don’t agree to develop back, they will have to come to us and Exxon Mobile knew already in the 50s that CO2 was destroying the planet but they kept silent to keep profits rolling in, this development is our fault.

7l7wa3,"Are you kidding? America is proving day after day that it IS the best. 

The best place for millionaires and billionaires to get showered with tax cuts. 
The best place to solidify your wealth just like the great bloodlines of old that gave us all those great kings!
The best place for income inequality. 
The best place for white Christian/Jewish men. 
The best place for mass government surveillance. 
The best place to have your company wreck safety nets and then get bailed out by the tax payer. (Where else can your sociopathic CEO get such a golden deal???)
The best place for monopolies and oligopolies. 
The best place for propaganda. 
The best place for Russians to rebrand themselves in a nice, little US Election marketing stunt. 
The best place for division. 
The best place for complacency.

s3ww35,">When Americans were predicting that Sanders may win

That literally became a meme. I mean, you can pretend it didn't happen, but this entire site was constantly trying to cope with Sanders losing again and again.

https://youtu.be/NHS-K7OuLAc

You had people celebrating him winning a few select states while he was wiped out everywhere else.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BernieSanders/comments/fasru0/bernie2020_berniebeatstrump/

I don't see how one can pretend this didn't happen. And it didn't go down quietly either. There was constant angry posts that alleged cheating. And how somehow all the moderates uniting under Biden was an illicit thing, while constantly clamouribg for all progressives to unite behind Sanders.

>Nobody outside of incredibly optimistic Labour members predicted that Corbyn would win in 2017 or 2019.

n6tizn,"Hmmm... i can accept being wrong about the covid ban affecting the passport strength. But it still stands that the list does not reflect reality now due to the covid bans. For example, if you wanted to compare passports now, you won't quite see where for example, Germans are allowed vs where Ghanaians are allowed. This is because visa restricted countries and covid-ban countries are both coloured red on the website without any note to say ""no visa restrictions, only covid ban"". So, for instance, if Ghanaians and Germans would typically be allowed to travel to Nigeria without visa requirements, but a covid ban exists for Ghana, then you would think that the German passport has greater mobility than Ghana for Nigeria - again, because the website doesn't make this distinction clear... hopefully this makes some sense 😊",2021-05-07 10:48:34

dge6rf,"> Idk lines shortages and lack of freedom and constant threat that you could get kicked out of a job/university?

Have u seen pictures of federal American workers waiting for food when the government shut down. Europe is no different, my family and everyone's family I know are more or less 1 pay check away from bread lines. Also try criticising your workplace and see how fast you will go out. Look up wages adjusted for inflation too they haven't risen since the 70s. So what u describe sounds more like the west today.

>Please explain me that paradise that we were too stupid to see around us? your steady diet of theoretical works on socialism will work this time™ right comrade?

You still haven't named a country that is more efficient than the USSR from the 20s to 50s when stalin was in power.
Just name ONE country that went from a feudal country that was war torn and ridden with poverty that had millions of orphaned children to a space exploring superpower that abolished homelessness and unemployment WHILE going through 2 massive famines (the last one being in 1947, the USSR ended famines, which is a feat considering that the Russian Empire was chronically plagued with famines) AND a world war that ravaged half the country's industry. Name ONE country that did this, or did something equally as good or better. Name a SINGLE COUNTRY that did this. just ONE.

Also capitalism has the illusion that it """"""""works"""""""" in the west because of imperialism. Capitalism doesn't work for the exploited nations and it is designed that way.

k8k4jq,Someone remembers our motto 😮⭐🌄,2020-12-07 21:29:17
k8k4jq,"Thank you for asking. It's a tad long...

A. I hate big government encroaching on it's citizens rights and freedoms. (Speech restictions, internet restricitions)

B.I have a fundemental belief that legislative, judicial and executive powers of governmnet should stay at a country level. I think, when it is given to a super state or a union of states, the people's voice is never reflected the way it is in UK parliament (or insert country's house of legislature). In the UK Parliament every member is a Brit no matter which region/county/city. Only Brits decide what happens to our country, black white, brown labour or Tory, the person is my country(wo)man. Not some other National. If I was born in any other country I'd want the same, I wouldn't want the British MEP's deciding what I can do in France (for instance).

C. I don't like that there is a European military (again executive power being given away). When does the EC say that our politicians (though they are idiots, they are our idiots that we put in place, idiots we can vote out if we feel like) no longer have a say in what our boy's in BDU's can and can't do? Where will we be forced to engage against our will?

D. I hate that the European Commision (the Executive branch of the EU) are 100% unelected by the people. They are appointed by the MEP's and by member states leaders. This is too much power away from the populus. And these are the people that propose new laws within the EU. Where as in the UK the executive branch is also voted in, they are MP's to beging with i.e. they have been voted in already. Unlike the EC member who are wholly unelected. Similarly I am against the monarchy in the UK holding executive power. The Queen has no place in a democracy, but alas the Brits are not like the French (off with their heads! Viva la Britania!).

E. I'm pro for free movement of goods and people. I agree with Adam Smith and David Ricardo we need more free trade for a prosperous nation. But I would rather be a hungry free-man than a fat slave. And hopefully have better trade deals across the world. Giving us acess to cheaper goods from places like China and counties in Africa and the Latin Americas by having much lower tarrifs on their exports. 

The above reasons are why I voted out and why I'm glad we are (hopefully) leaving. I hope that's answered your question. Lemme know if you wanna know more😊

Edit spelling",2020-12-08 03:24:07

k8k4jq,"🤣 chalk it up to whatever you like, it’s an issue I’ve had to study in higher education. NATO, as founded by America, isn’t going to support a supranational take over. That’s just impractical and silly, nor is what NATO was founded upon (it’s literally against socialist IGOs). It would also take the military power of those most sceptical at the moment (France, Italy) to join in to be at all successful, and there’s not even much German enthusiasm for the United States of Europe. It seems you are the one who is living a silly pipedream! 

As for my biases, do you mean my biases to the facts?! It’s extremely clear that what you said above is factually untrue as of right now, and when I pointed this out you said I was getting lost in the “exactitude of words” (extremely important in legislation and legislative bodies, btw?!).

Grow up. The EU isn’t a state, it isn’t overwhelmingly undemocratic, and it’s not going to become United in the sense that you’re using the word anytime soon without some serious pro Eu parties coming to power. 

Your blatant ignorance to the relevance of eurosceptic parties in Europe currently is astounding. Italy? Greece? France? All with eurosceptic voices prominently featured in their governments. Grow up and get a grip on reality please. And definitely don’t make silly claims and then admit that the wording is wrong. It’s not welcome anywhere because it isn’t helpful.",2020-12-08 14:03:10

If they're fluent, they must've spent a lot of time in contact with the language, most probably with Dutch people and media, maybe even spent some time in the Netherlands. Such experiences most probably influence their world view, e.g. if they've experienced how the government works in the Netherlands, they may have much higher expectations from their own (in comparison an average Belarusian citizen). Same probably applies to most who speak good English, or any other foreign language.

It's still a useful to hear their opinions, and surely good that such people are there and (hopefully) spread this attitude. But I wouldn't assume all Belarusians are like them.",2021-05-24 20:01:31

7h180i,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

106gf7p,"Short answer: Hypothetically, yes... but kinda not really if we're speaking legally due to the extremely legal nature of the word ""unconstitutional"".

Long answer: Realistically, no... but with lots of nuances that make ""no"" sound like ""yes"" unless we are absolutely laser-focused on separating the legality of political science and the reality of public sentiment. Even then, anyone could be easily painted as being a disingenuous weasel. Despite everything I read and discuss with everyone I can, I'm just a keyboard warrior with a ridiculous username, a brain cell, and a distinct lack of legal education. Basically... **I AM NOT A LAWYER** and can only sound intelligent until an actual lawyer confirms or rejects anything I try to explain.

. . . . . . . . . .

**CONSTITUTIONAL OR UNCONSTITUTIONAL**

First, the easier detail. Legally speaking, only the Supreme Court can declare anything to be unconstitutional. The rest of us can argue all we want and call everything unconstitutional, but as a legal designation, that word can only be activated by the Supreme Court.

**SANCTIONED OR UNSANCTIONED**

Now, the trickier detail. Regarding ""unsanctioned"": [Merriam-Webster defines **unsanctioned** as ""lacking effective or authoritative approval or consent""](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unsanctioned) (let's assume there's no potential nitpicking here), so this is where it gets tricky. Since the United States Constitution specifically grants Congress the power of declaring war, the United States is, legally speaking, only at war if Congress declares war, so all American wars are automatically sanctioned. However, legality and reality may differ. Since the United States Constitution also specifically grants the President the role as the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces, the President's military commands must be obeyed. In fact, [all American personnel (enlisted and commissioned) swear to uphold the Constitution](https://history.army.mil/faq/oaths.html), which means all presidential commands are essentially constitutional **unless** the Supreme Court declares anything to be unconstitutional. Congress does not need to declare war for a president to move American troops into any area, whether it is at peace or at war.

That said, Congress can vote to pass legislation asking the President to pull troops out of an area or even threaten to impeach the President (especially if the Supreme Court finds a war to be unconstitutional, except Congress would have declared that war anyways, so the Supreme Court can only contest that a military action is unconstitutional, except the President is the commander-in-chief), and the people have the powers to protest against any and all military actions and to vote for Senators and Representatives to vote that way, but the President can choose to ignore all of this. However, in the absence of a declared war...

**THE WAR POWERS RESOLUTION - UNDECLARED WAR?**

> [The War Powers Resolution ""requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and forbids armed forces from remaining for more than 60 days, with a further 30-day withdrawal period, without congressional authorization for use of military force (AUMF) or a declaration of war by the United States. The resolution was passed by two-thirds each of the House and Senate, overriding the veto of President Richard Nixon.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution)

> [It has been alleged that the War Powers Resolution has been violated in the past – for example, by George W. Bush invading Iraq in 2003 or by President Bill Clinton in 1999, during NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Congress has disapproved all such incidents, but none has resulted in any successful legal actions being taken against the president for alleged violations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution)

**BEFORE THE WAR POWERS RESOLUTION**

Despite all this, there was nothing legally wrong with [President Theodore Roosevelt (fifth cousin of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt of WWII) sending the Great White Fleet (1907-1909 on a journey around the globe to achieve some goals, such as making friendly courtesy visits to numerous countries while displaying new U.S. naval power to the world and to deter a threatened war with Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Fleet).

> [Prior to the ships’ departure, Congress raised concerns about funding. According to the Naval Historical Center, Maine Senator Eugene Hale made his intention known to withhold funding for the effort. The President's response was that if Congress was unwilling to fund the trip, he already had the funds to send the Fleet out into the Pacific. But if Congress wanted the fleet to return home, they would have to fund the other half of the trip. As noted by Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris, the President would not be deterred. He stated ""I am Commander-in-Chief, and my decision is absolute in the matter.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Fleet)

**HOW TO FORCE A WAR**

But, and now to finally start answering your question... What if war broke out because of this?

Well, the Spanish-American War happened partly because the [USS Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Maine_(1889\)) was sent to Cuba to protect American interests and exploded in Havana Harbor, which exacerbated Spanish-American relations. As sinister as ""protect American interests"" sounds, the United States government has always been extremely aggressive about protecting American citizens (ex. [Barbary Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_Wars)\), so most Americans would scoff at the idea of not sending military assistance.

In fact, when Iran took American diplomatic personnel as hostages, many Americans (including Vietnam veterans and anti-war protesters) openly advocated for war or at least a military rescue operation. At the least, Iran had perpetrated a specific wrong. This is another situation in which a war could have happened, and there wasn't even any need to send military forces into anyone's paths since Iran forced the hostage crisis.

**FINALLY, A GODDAMN CONCLUSION**

But to focus on your specific scenario, a President (as the commander-in-chief) can knowingly (responsibly or irresponsibly, with or without approval from military advisors, with or without Congressional approval) send military personnel into a risky situation and tempt a military conflict. However, that is not legally considered a war, so there is no unsanctioned war. Congress can disapprove of it by voting against the President's actions, but that's not against the war since the war can only exist if Congress approves of it by declaring war... which automatically sanctions the war. Once this war is sanctioned by Congress, the Supreme Court can (hypothetically) rule it to be unconstitutional (which can also be challenged to make it constitutional, since the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war), but the President has the constitutional powers of commander-in-chief anyways.

As such, legally speaking, we can have an unconstitutional war, but the chances of the Supreme Court ruling any war as unconstitutional is extremely unlikely. That would be controversial and almost immediately challenged since Congress is probably sanctioning the war by declaring it, which probably means the (extremely fickle) general public has demanded war.

Based on my non-lawyer interpretation of that legal designation, an ""unsanctioned and thus unconstitutional war"" cannot happen because no war (later ruled as unconstitutional or not) can be unsanctioned, but it is possible to have an ""unsanctioned and thus unconstitutional military action"" because a President can constitutionally say, ""I am Commander-in-Chief, and my decision is absolute in the matter."" The military must obey all presidential commands unless it conflicts with human rights, but then we would have to deal with WWII, the Nuremberg Trials, and the inevitable conclusion of [""Hitler and the Nazis""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law). But the main point is that the President can force the military into a disgusting situation.

**YOU FUCKING DISINGENUOUS WEASEL**

This is where anyone can argue that I'm a disingenuous weasel if they don't want to respect my attempt to only speak legally due to the extremely legal nature of the word ""unconstitutional"".

**WINNERS GO HOME AND FUCK THE PROM QUEEN**

[Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery starred in a 1996 movie named **The Rock**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rock_(film\)) that has a scene that somewhat touches on the difficulty of obeying orders. In short, a team is infiltrating Alcatraz through a shower room accessible only through the sewers, and they must decide if their opposition is considered a domestic enemy. The American Civil War and the January 6 Incident are two other great examples of the potential of a domestic enemy. I can say all I want that January 6 was a traitorous invasion by domestic enemies and political terrorists, but that's my personal designation, not a legal definition as determined by the United States Government.

  And didnt they stop the implementation of General Plan East where 80% to 85% of all Polish were to be removed/exterminated and the Polish people/nation/language was to completely destroyed..

The country with thé most locked up people in the world, where slavery is legal in prisons.

The country that locks up teenagers for 6 years for making a joke in a video game. In Europe, we have something called ""Freedom of Expression"". It basically means that you can say whatever you want without being put in prison. 

Teenager said an offensive joke in Europe? Not going to prison (for-profit slavery camp) for 6 years. Children also don't get expelled from schools for not singing the national anthem like some brainwashed cult 🤭

Have a non-politically correct opinion? People may disagree. People might hate you for it. But you have the right to say it. In America, having the wrong opinion or saying a joke that offended too many people could land you in prison for a looong time because they don't have the freedom of expression (at least not one that applies to regular people).

b713kg,"I can only speak for Sweden. You can choose to work (multiple different choices rather than just picking cotton) for about 6x the wage of US prisons. You can study. You can borrow books from the library. You can go to the gym. Many prisons have music studios where you can take courses on how to play an instrument, painting courses etc. etc. Plenty of more things to do than in American prisons.

There's a short documentary about an American prison boss who visits a Swedish prison and thinks it's wrong that they have it so good, and that you're meant to suffer in prison for what you (possibly) did. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfEsz812Q1I

We also don't put people in prison for no reason. America is statistically thé least free country in the world if you count proportionally how many free people they have vs non-free. Teenagers get put in prison for 6 years in the US for making a joke in a video game. In Sweden, we have an amendment called ""the expression freedom"" which essentially means that you can say anything you want without going to prison for it. People may not like what you have to say. They may argue with you. But you aint going to prison. 

In the US, if you tell an offensive joke or hold the ""wrong"" opinion, you can get a lengthy prison (granted you aren't rich). That's why the US has lowest % of free population out of any country in the entire world, thus making them thé least free country in the world.

lj6atv,"Oh man this picture takes me back! I had one of the spontaneously fun nights of my life in Alicante. **Story time!**

My mother and I went to Spain for six weeks as a celebration of my graduating high school 🎓, to learn some Spanish, and so my mom could teach university courses there for an exchange program, but for American students at the Spanish university in Valencia. We stayed in the dorms, but we arrived 2-3 days before, which felt like a mistake; I didn't even want to go on the trip because bratty varsity football me couldn't imagine leaving his friends for six weeks. So the first few nights my mom and I just wandered around Valencia and ate alone at the dormitory cafeteria. I was 18 and seemed like I just signed up for half a summer hanging out with mom in a foreign country (I love my mom and love hanging out with her, we had a great time, but for a newly minted teenaged adult in a country with a low drinking age this seemed like hell).

Well, once the college kids started arriving shit started popping off like no other! The first night they arrived I was so desperate for interaction with young people I pretty much just walked up to the first group that seemed like knuckleheads and introduced myself and asked what they had going on. They said they heard about this discoteca in the middle of nowhere called Bananas, and I should come... Well I didn't get back home until 7am that morning while my mom was making coffee, and had suddenly made a bunch of new friends who just happened to all be my mom's students. 

That weekend, a bunch of these new friends were going to Alicante for this beach festival, and it was the only weekend my mom and I didn't have plans. This was 2002, and the USD/Euro exchange rate was baller for an American kid with a bunch of graduation money to burn. So I bought a roundtrip train ticket after pleading with my mom, and tore a page out of the guide book for Alicante and headed to the train station at like 8pm. When I arrived it was dark af and the train station was damn near empty. I put my bag in a paid train locker and tried to read my torn out page to find where the party was at and hopefully bump into my friends. Leaving the train station I thought I made a huge mistake, as it was dark outside, and quiet too. The page had a map on one side, and a paragraph about this beach festival I was going to. I had no hotel reservations, and no idea where to go.

I walked for a few blocks in the dark before hearing fireworks the next street over. I turned a corner and right in front of me was this strip it beautiful sidewalk in OP's picture, with a cliff-side castle all lit up, overlooking the beach.

As soon as I got onto the side walk a group of 2-3 dozen young ran screaming past me like they were being chased, nearly knocking me over! I didn't know what they were running from, until I saw fireworks on either side of the sidewalk, firing along a line about 6-7ft above the ground, moving in the direction the kids were running. The fireworks got closer and closer and closer to me and then past me. I want to say I bravely stood there as they exploded past where I stood, but European fire safety standards must be more lax than in the States because that shit felt like it was hella close!

That must have kicked off the fireworks show, because as soon as that happened fireworks started blowing up left and right above the beach right in front of me! The stretch of beach (or a pier?) that jutted out into the water seemed like a good place to watch from afar, but again those lax safety standards meant I watched as the falling embers of those fireworks rained down on segments of the crowd... Spain was wild boy!

Once the fireworks were done, I turned to the first young people I saw and in my broken Spanish asked were the clubs/bars were. They pointed me in the direction of a strip of bars/clubs, where I figured I'd run into my friends at some point. As I turned to walk away, I decided to buy a beer at a tent first, and jumped in line behind two (seemingly) middle school aged boys... They asked ""dos cervesas por favor"" to my shock, in high pitched prepubescent voices. They were served and I was up, mouth hung agape.

I made my way to the strip, and I listened to the music blaring out of each of the bars before deciding which to go into. When I heard one bar blaring Tupac and had a mural on the wall of a bunch of hip hop stars I knew I found my spot.

2-3 hours later I had made an English-speaking girl who actually was living in Valencia, but was not associated with my group. We danced and drank until I smelled the familiar smell of weed in the air and my Spidey sense went a-tinglin'. I'm a huge pot head and part of the reason I was hesitant to go on the trip was that I didn't know how I'd find bud. I'd managed to score hash the the Euros seem to love but that shit was harshing my throat. I approached the dude burning and asked if he knew where I could get some. He said he had some for sale, and I said I'd buy it. He said how much, and I said ""todos."" All of it. I ran to the atm and pulled out a few hundred Euros, he met me in the bathroom and started pulling out sacks if weed from all kinds of hidden places in his clothes. He sold me like two ounces of schwag but it was herb and I was now a very popular guy around town, burning enormous joints walking through Alicante at like 4-5 in the morning. Around this time I hear s rowdy ass crowd of unmistakably American voices, and a crowd of my new college friends turned a corner. I introduced my new friends to my college friends, and we sat on the beach smoking weed and drinking beer until the sun came up. We went to their hotel room to crash for an hour or two before heading to the train station. 

Once at the train station, standing in line I fell asleep standing up, and was an absolute wreck. Slept the entire ride to Valencia, and when i shows up back on campus I slept until dinner. 

I ended up pre rolling the entire 2 ounces, and selling them to the kids for 5 Euro each. I would party with them until the wee hours if the morning, and then they'd have to go to my mom's class and I'd go to my dorm room and sleep.

I told him not sorry, but I (or more likely, male members of my family) WOULD have to kill him, for both reasons: IF he came within sight of me (or vice versa), and at all, for the threat itself. Cultural obligations! 💣 But, years have gone by, and the trail's gone cold. I mean seriously, how would they actually find him? So, the events of 1956 still stir emotions 😌.

They've been spoon fed the high-fructose corn syrup that 'Murica is the 'Greatest Country on Earth'™ since birth and many of them refuse to accept that there is another way.  

They will cut of their nose to spite their face - see poor people voting against universal healthcare because 'Socialism bad!!!'. even though Americans actually pay more than DOUBLE the cost of healthcare of other first world nations for the WORST results among first world countries.

The populace is broke. 30% of Americans have less than $100 in the bank. the can't afford to fight for anything. especially when, as I said earlier, in 48 states, your employer can fire you for no reason.

Elections are held on working days, so only people who can afford time off work can vote.  Voter suppression via denying people with criminal records the right to vote (65% of the black population) is rampant.  As is gerrymandering election districts.


I could go on all day about Americas faults.  like Ghandi said 'I like your Christ but hate your Christians.  I don't mind some Americans, but I despise America.  From the very beginning it has been about getting to the top by taking advantage of others.

It never has been the panacea that people have made it out to be. it sees itself as 'The leader of the Free World™'.  It's not different from China.  Just another bully.

Since my Mother's family were refugees from Greece (WWII) I have very little connection to Greece but Bulgaria will always be my birthplace. I have lived in Germany for 10 years now and it is my adopted home so out of respect I consider myself German as well (naturalized).

If you (a Scot) move to Canada (for example), you will at some point consider yourself Canadian (which doesn't change the fact you're Scottish).

I seems legit as its geographically define which is THE most important point. But for politician reasons i can understand the boarders definition is dynamic. But its very problematic as it for example can create geopolitical problems in the future for example.

Your naiveness would be amazing if unfortunately others didn’t share your views. The whole point of a defensive alliance is the willingness to fight each other enemies….it’s kinda the whole point to join one….

If you think the US isn’t gonna arm the crap out of Taiwan and other neighboring countries; around China you’re delusional. Especially when there’s no way countries like Japan or Australia; are gonna let China control what is essentially 92% of the world’s advanced semiconductor production capacity. Along with a $40billion dollar investment from $TSMC to build a fab in Arizona; to take pressure off Taiwan’s advanced chip production fabs.

You claim it’s the United States seeking to destroy China due to the weakening it’s economic position; which is odd; considering how they are two completely different models (manufacturing vs services) both can exist completely fine. It’s Taiwan (for semiconductors) China’s technology theft, & building islands to claim territory; that the US has a problem with. 🤔",2023-06-08 08:14:10

1440sgu,"I'm not asking them to be altruistic 🤨

I'm asking them to either have the kind of communication people claim they have or stop saying ""they told us so"" when their government really didn't. ""Spend more"" doesn't count, as said spending is not the same as the capability of Europe to defend itself, Europe spends enough for that, it's just structured poorly.

Europe should have a reorganisation and military build up regardless of what America says of course, that's self-evident and I'm not going to dispute that or deny our responsibility as Europeans for our own security.

Again the only thing I've tackled is Americans apparently being surprised that their dogshit PR doesn't get the results they supposedly want. Hell, Denmark regularly opposes EU military integration on the grounds that this would conflict with NATO. All the US has to say is ""actually we're fine with this, a European military would be a great compliment to NATO."" They don't. It would almost seem that implicitly they are supporting Denmark's case. So if the end result then is ""we shouldn't increase our military might because the US might see that as competition"" then for that the US is on some level responsible.

We can again argue that Europe shouldn't care what the US things and should go ahead anyway, but a lot of Europeans do care or worry about what America thinks, and this is what comes across about what America thinks, which America could _easily_ address if that is not the case.

So again, either America _wants_ a Europe that is divided and weak, _or_ it's so utterly incompetent in PR that they manage to communicate the exact opposite of what they want to Europeans.",2023-06-08 14:58:02

Europe: You what mate?

The fact he actually says that we should apologize for what we ""done in the last 3000 years"" is the cherry on the top.

How many nations/people existed in Europe in 1000 BCE that exists today? None.

Damn, not even Rome (if we go with the mythical history) was even founded yet. Most nations of Europe appeared in the last 1000 years.

He wants to go as far as 3000 years ago? Then all of humanity should apologize 😂. The idiot spoke as someone as ignorant as the average Chega voter here in Portugal.

Sure, Europe should apologize for the arab nations being the last ones to rid of slavery in the 1960's.

I have dealt and still deal with pretty horrible depression, and I can relate to that. You just have to search for the good because the bad makes for a snappy title.

In fact, a lot of this stuff got probably cut or forgotten anyway. Someone like Baldur, the innocent son of the chief deity sacrificed for the good of others is almost certainly some form of Christian insert. Other stuff got changed as well.

E.g. I read in the Icelandic National Museum that the tombs of the people back then showed that women generally were held in as high regard as men, which doesn't show as much in the stories and customs preserved by the monks.

Now, if some monk writes down stories of crossdressing gods etc. and that's just what was left after some christian reductionism, I would almost bet there were more stories like this.",2021-06-19 15:52:14

btaaf2,Outstanding 😂 best part is all the triggered right wing crowd.,2019-05-26 22:53:35
btaaf2,"The “point” the video is trying to make is trash. Here’s the truth, there isn’t a Nazi/Neo-Nazi alive that is going to argue you if you call them a Nazi. They don’t care. They know what they are and they are proud of it. The people who get mad, get mad because they aren’t Nazis. Liberals nowadays tend to give everyone in the Conservative category the label of Nazi based on their own subjective observations about that person. “Oh, you aren’t ok with illegal immigration? You hate brown people you Nazi.” It couldn’t possibly be they are against all illegal immigration despite which race commits the crime. They couldn’t possibly be for reforming immigration laws to allow people to come here and not sit on a list for 10 years. 

Calling every conservative is Nazi is like conservatives who call all liberals Communists. It’s intellectually dishonest, superficial(taking a single statement without getting to know why they feel that way), and a super easy and convenient way to make sure you can escape the debate/conversation when your opinion is challenged. 

Oh and to be clear, the type of people who do this exist all over the political spectrum and I find it equally aggravating no matter where it comes from. The reason I put so much focus on liberals is because the post was left wing propaganda. 

Also, since I’ve already come this far...Although Nazis had/have a fucked up moral code...we cannot forget what it was. A political party. The nationalist socialist party. And yes liberals, many conservatives are nationalists. But guess what, hella liberals are socialist. 

For disarming citizens: Nazis and Liberals
For forced speech and taking away free speech: Nazis and Liberals. 
For government economic redistribution: Nazis and Liberals. 

You see where I’m going here? A valid comparison can be made from either side when lumping all conservatives together and comparing them to Nazis. Just like a valid argument can be made when lumping all liberals together and comparing them to Nazis. You know what that means? Neither side has any right to make the argument. We should argue individuals and opinions....not the straw man versions of the political parties based on our own bias.

Edit: 21 downvotes and not a single attempt at a rebuttal. 😂😂 Thanks for proving my point. Enjoy your “yes men” echo chambers.",2019-05-26 22:22:01

Also people tend to forget all the good things about the EU, like the Schengen agreement and all the privileges that come with it. You take them for granted and only see the bad things about the EU. Also people in Austria tend to think that we as such a tiny country pay a disproportionally big amount of money for other countries. 
The nationlist party FPÖ loves to exploit this of course. This I thik adds to the mix.

It's 2022 and Europes' ***""economic master 🅱️lan""*** has been in motion for more than a decade, with the only results being complete collapse in quality of life and no real exit from the economic crisis in sight.

Greeks are mostly thankful for all the positives that came with the EU, but the elephant in the room cannot be ignored.

For the past 13 years the EU has been synonymous with the introduction of unrealistic taxation, high price of living and poverty wages.

10rm8h6,"Democracy™: where Germanic white people live. The more Germanic the country, the more Democracy™ there is.",2023-02-02 13:51:14
10rm8h6,"Adding up scores like this based on the characteristics of how “well” a government works seems to me to have to be biased in one way or another, which it is. Denmark for example has literally 0 representation of racial minorities in both the media and especially in parliament (folketinget) while the US has much more representation.

Denmark for that reason alone can NOT be a fully functional democracy, as the entire population isn’t represented.

I get the way they add up scores looking at the different institutions, but understanding how well all institutions work seems to lead to some bias in my opinion, especially when something this integral doesn’t have a huge impact on the score. They lack transparency when it comes to their sources as well, big shocker.

All in all, I’d love it if we could rank countries in a way like this, but lists like this just make us **feel** smarter. In sociology, it is actually frowned upon to call some countries more “developed” than others, as it can lead to a narrow understanding. If you truly want to learn about a country, it takes months upon months of studying it, at which point, you can compare that country to your native country to see how they do things *differently*, not necessarily better or worse. There are many different things I could note in my own case, one difference between Turkey/Russia/China and Europe/The US I’ve noticed is that the former are told from a young age they exist to serve their country, always being propped up with nationalism, while the latter is told their country is there to serve **them**. This reflects in the political understanding of people on a deep level, even though Turkey is a democracy for example. 
I can’t even exactly tell you 100% what this has led to in Turkey, as this is a very deep topic, but people seem to dislike our groups more than in the west, and being Turkish in every sense of the word is something you should be proud of. Because of that, Syrians are considered a *danger* to the nation to a larger degree than in the west. Kurds have forcefully been Turkified as well, and racial slurs seem to be pretty commonplace. Also, Turks seem to be very proud of any foreign representation, all of what I mentioned is normal, of course, but it seems more amplified in Turkey than in other nations because of the aforementioned facts. In a nation such as Denmark, while there is a lot of racism, the fundamental role of the government is to *help* all its **citizens** be equal in every sense of the word. The Turkish narrative is more so to **further the Turkish identity** because of Kemalism. This leads to a fundamental difference in the worldview of people, even if the average Turk obviously isn’t evil and wouldn’t wish harm upon others.
Ranking it as worse without any further explanation just gives you a more narrow worldview. Instead, you should spend months or years studying such nations to understand how it plays out and what its flaws are **specifically** instead of just saying it is “more corrupted” or whatever the fuck. It may even be less corrupted, just look at the Soviet Union, even though a lot of idiots on Reddit said the USSR’s downfall was due to corruption once🤦‍♂️",2023-02-02 13:09:39

I was interning with a prominent Georgian NGO during their previous presidential election back in 2017 and NDI was overseeing the Georgian NGO’s election monitoring work. Well, I struck up a conversation with the NDI’s top supervisor for that project. She was commenting on corruption in Ukraine and Georgia, and I asked her how what she was describing is any different than lobbying is in the USA. I asked her how political favors, dark money spending, and other forms of financial compensation/donations are any different from what she was describing as a major impediment to democratic development in Ukraine and Georgia. She said “It’s just different.” I said “yeah, sure, the USA just legalized corruption via Citizens United, but the end result is still the same. What you’re describing as corruption and buying politicians in Ukraine, Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, is a the multi-billion dollar lobbying industry in the USA.” She just repeated “It’s different.” I asked and again she said “It just is.” I was stupefied.

Likewise, the head of the NGO I was interning at, along with its vice director and top legal analyst had no clue how American presidential elections work (specifically they didn’t even know that the Electoral College exists) nor about the difference between the Senate and House of Representatives, yet they’re insisting that Georgian elections ought to resemble American elections and how amazing Congress is for its ability to function. I, as an undergraduate, knew more about comparative politics than the heads of this NGO, an NGO which collaborates with Transparency International, Freedom House, and others…

I realize that one mustn’t know about the politics of foreign countries to formulate a coherent opinion and critique of one’s own country’s domestic politics, however, knowing the basics of the happenings in other countries allows you to know where within the global political spectrum and trend your own country sits. 

Lastly, I find it laughable that Hungary is still considered a “Flawed Democracy” and honestly, after the events of 06 Jan and the GOP’s multiple attempts to overturn multiple elections, I’m surprised that the USA remains in that category as well (at the very least at the top of it). Organizations such as these will almost always list Western countries and their allies as democratic and their peripheral countries as “hybrid.” In my opinion, this is the replacement lingo for “First World,” “Second World” and “Third World” countries.",2023-02-03 02:53:15

dmtdy9,"To any Czech redditors reading: Regarding the Czech pro porn industry, what with soooooo many Czech men & women going into it etc... How exactly do you go about actually getting into the porn industry in Czechia??, Where do you go?, What do you?, Who do you contact?, What does it involve?... Also is it easier for women or men in Czechia to get in the industry??, Like i assume a women doesnt need much or anything to get into and make it in pro porn, but for a Czech man is it like American porn, does he have to have a big cock to even be considered? or does the Czech industry value other traits as more important(ie good looks, a great buff body, lots of stamina & endurance for the extremely long & difficult shoots, can cum on demand, be ok with loads of strangers in the room as your having sex etc).. as an example would an small dick yet attractive, fit, buff guy with lots of stamina who could cum on demand, or a beefy, thicc fat, chubby small dick guy(like say myself with my 7.92-8.8cm, short & thick, veiny, fat uncut chode cock) would i be allowed in, and accepted and welcome in the Czech pro porn industry??... Just curious, is there a high bar or low bar of entry into porn for men in Czechia?, Just what's the situation like?..


Also its interesting that porn is such a huge and common thing in the Czech Republic, i mean(and correct me if im wrong) i thought Czechia was nowadays a rather rich & prosperous country with a highly educated, highly skilled populous and a country with a good peforming economy etc etc... So with all that in mind Czechia isnt the usual poor country where people go into porn out of economic nessessity, so just why are so, soooo many Czechs going into and doing pro porn??..


PS. Czechia, UK, Germany & Russia make the best porn in Europe imo. These are Europe's best in this field. And infact of those countries imo when Czech and British pornstars come together~, when they team up it makes for some amazing porn ive discovered over the years. Its a winning combination, it really is🇨🇿💏🇬🇧.",2019-10-26 07:50:18
dmtdy9,"Some of my thoughts on this:


First off i feel like what with amatuer porn really taking off in the last few years these numbers are increasingly meaningless and irrelevent as professional porn slowly dies off and has an ever shrinking percentage of the porn pie etc what with everyone now pocessing their own ability to make their own very decent to even high quality amatuer porn. We're all and pocess the ability to be our own pornstars these days(myself included, i mean amatuer porn gives a great avenue for men like myself who fall outside the mainstream. I mean im a fat, portly & chubby guy and fully erect i have a 3-3.5inch/7.92-8.8cm micropenis phimosis short & thick chode cock etc.. You think pro porn would cater to and accept me, fat chance, i highly doubt it. Pro porn ignores men like me. So amatuer porn still allows me to be a sexual being), you dont need to belong to a studio or sign any pro contracts etc. I mean i founded and for 5 years use to run two very large n popular tumblrs(one dedicated to porn, mostly gay porn, and the other dedicated to uncut penises(of all sizes), more specifically fully erect uncut penises with long, tight, snouty and or phimosis foreskins, i had over 4500+ followers on this one alone) and by and large both tumblrs was mostly made up of amatuer content. The pro stuff on my tumblrs was still there, still very significant, but it wasnt as prominent as the amatuer content believe it or not. So yeah for me anyway amatuer porn has long since surpassed pro porn. Its just soooo much hotter, its real, the peformers are actually into it, are doing it for the pleasure and enjoyment of the act itself, unlike in so much pro porn where the pro ""stars"" just look bored, are going through the motions, clearly not into it or into their scene partner, there's no love for the craft etc.. And as a viewer if the stars of the scene are not into it then how am i going to be either??.. So much proffessional porn leaves alot to be desired these days. Also amatuer porn provides so much more variety and niches that simply are not catered too by pro porn, the mainstream is not the be all and end all these days. But moving on with my thoughts further... 


🇱🇻: Like wtf going on in Lativa!?, That is a big surprise as i think ive never seen any Latvian pornstars, where are they?, And why compared to the other Baltics is Latvia so big on pornstars?, What's going on in Latvia?.


🇷🇺: Tbh i thought Russia would be higher in number considering how prominent their porn is online. They do have some very big hitters when it comes to porn though. So the average number of 5 doesnt tell the hole story. Generally speaking Russian porn is pretty good imo. I love how wild, crazy and intense Russian porn is and can get. Its awesome!.


🇬🇧: Interestingly and rather ironically... For a country that's internationally known for its unnattractivness and mocked for how ugly its people are etc [The UK by far actually has the best, most attractive & hottest(mostly body wise, there's lotsa thicc girls & PAWGs here, we're the European leaders in that field of porn tbh. The hottest girls in porn right now are British imo](https://www.xvideos.com/pornstars-index/united_kingdom)NSFW obviously) female pornstars imo. The men on the other hand are rather unattractive & often fugly af, which does detract alot from the product imo. But still despite the ugly men we make some damn good straight porn i'll say. Its defo up there as some of the best Europe has to offer. Gay porn is a different story though, Central/Eastern Europe is the undisputed kingpin. UK pro gay porn is really meh. Not very good at all.


🇨🇿🇭🇺: How did porn become so big in Czechia & Hungary, presumably it never use to be the case, so what changed and what happened in these two countries to make them the massive porn producers we see today??, Also what kind of ppl go into porn and why do so many people go into porn in Czechia and Hungary??, Lastly are they looked down upon.



🇨🇿🇭🇺2: But now its most likely gay porn alone that is giving these two countries such massive, holy shit numbers. I mean personally ive posted various czech porn content to various nsfw subs over the years(and infact of my favourite male porn stars of recent times is Czech. His name is [Boris Lang, nsfw, one of my all time highest posts(over 700 karma) is of him](https://www.reddit.com/r/broslikeus/comments/cg0m8d/from_central_europe_24yo_chiseled_czech_muscle/). He is simply stunning. I first came😏 across him a year or two ago and ive been a huge fan ever since. Imo n idk about you but i think he is the best peformer/most beautiful/hottest guy in gay & bi porn right now. Also its not just physical attributes. I just love the enthusiasm and passion, the intensity he brings to his scenes(whether topping or bottoming). He never phones it in like so many of these guys. You can tell he loves all things sex, he loves his work and that captivates me. Lastly his huge appeal to me is because of things like his small stature(he's only like 5'6 tall) and im the same height, and also his dick size(which by porn standards is very small. Imo it looks no bigger than 5 inches maybe 5.5-5.8 at most... And im a top with a short & fat, stubby micro boner 7.92-8.8cm/3-3.5 incher cock etc so his smaller appendage really connects with me, its so rarely seen in porn). I think the fact that he's such a powerful sexual being and mostly does topping as well.. well i just find it all so refreshing & heartening to see, even more so when you consider that often short, small dick/unhung guys in porn 99% of the time are pigeonholed as a subbmissive bottom, but he bucks that trend, i digress)...And the crazy thing is he's just one of many. Like so many Czechs & Hungarians... Delish hotties galore. Its like they have a production line pumping out all these hot dudes everywhere. Honestly its no exagerration to say that the Czech Republic & Hungary does produce some the best (gay) porn in the entire world. A world powerhouse in that field tbh, not just Europe. I mean porn(both gay & straight porn) has(and has for most non-Czechs/non-Hungarians people out there) defo put the Czech Republic & Hungary on the map in the modern world in a way that nothing else has. Seeing as the country plays a major role on the small screen(by that i mean screens of the worlds phones/laptops/PC Desktops etc)... As many of the Czech & Hungarian nation's most iconic cities have had a starring role in many porno movies/scenes, many major n hugely popular porn studios have also, and many of said studios are based there as well(again particulary gay porn, especially what with the likes of CzechHunter, WilliamHiggins, Bel Ami Online. Who are the biggest and most popular studio in the entire world iirc). But they're all merely one of many studios. Prague along with likes of Budapest(and also to a lesser extent Bratislava & Ljubljana) etc is Europe's and indeed (what with the internet) one of the world's main porn capitals and powerhouse's. Europe's porn heartlands are in the Czech Republic & Hungary etc and Prague & Budapest is a massive part of that nowadays. The Czech & Hungarian porn industry has again as said(much like Hollywood with its big screen movies filiming in central Europe recently) put the place on the map in a huge way, that cannot be denied. But having said all that one of the negatives of Czech & Hungarian gay porn(much like American gay porn too) is the fact that a large percentage of the 'gay guys/pornstars' are actually straight guys who are only doing gay porn cuz it pays much better. Its a common thing called Gay For Pay. It can result often in some really bad porn as its obvious the peformers would rather be anywhere else, no chemistry in the scene and they are not interested. Often these guys dont even get hard. And the camera keeps cutting etc.. to hide this. Its rubbish to watch. Really does detract from what should be hot but isnt. But still fortunately they produce sooooo much porn that one can easily avoid the crap stuff like that.


🇷🇴: This is not surprising that Romania is up there in numbers. I mean its not so much pro porn, but amatuer cam-show porn where Romania is a major European player. One sees many of them on there. Its a safe, fun, easy, quick way to make some $$$ i guess, so why not do it. Im not a fan of cam stuff, so i cant say much here. But Romanians really are pretty hot tbh.


🇩🇪: From my online travels i honestly have no negative word to say about German porn. I like it. You Germans really make some top notch porn imo. As a chubby portly guy myself i love how there's seemingly so many chubby men & smaller cocks starring in German porn, i really connect with both those things as chubby small dick man, and German porn is great for those into all kinds of fetish stuff as well. Its strange cuz one never intially thinks of Germans as these hot, yummy sexual beings, stereotypes n all(shows how silly they are).. but the internet says otherwise~. Some real hot men and women there for sure. Also [infact one of my most popular nsfw posts on reddits porn subs is from Germany](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallCockWorship/comments/9xf23p/if_you_go_down_to_the_woods_today_your_sure_of_a/), so danke schon for all the karma points Germany, you guys and girls rock ;D. Also QueenParis and GermanGooGirls are the most high profile German female pornstars that ive heard of. I think QueenParis esp she's fantastic. Love her work. MyDirtyHobby especially is a great place to find quality Deutchland porn.


🇪🇸: Now this is a surprise. Ive never really thought of Spain as producing many if any pornstars, where are they??, Most of them end up in America right?, ive seen a fair few over there, But how did Spain become such a hotbed(no pun) for producing pro pornstars??, What kind of people go into the profession in Spain?, How did become so a relatively big thing in Spain..

1b0ev9b,"**From The Telegraph:**

Brussels police officers were sprayed with manure by angry farmers who used their tractors to storm cordons in a protest over the European Union’s green deal.

Demonstrators hauled barbed-wire fences to the side of the road to create room for the agricultural vehicles to barge through the barricades.

Footage of one of the incidents showed a handful of police officers, wearing full riot gear, failing to stop the farmers as they approached a meeting of EU agricultural ministers nearby.

Baton-wielding police were doused in manure from one truck which blockaded a road in the city.

The police were left with no option but to retreat.

Local media also reported seeing farmers hurling oranges and fire crackers at the police barricades.

Water cannons were deployed to douse the flames from mounds of burning tyres and hay bales strewn across the Rue de la Loi, a four-lane highway that runs parallel to the European Council’s headquarters.

# Protests cross the continent

“There is indeed an ongoing intervention on rue de la Loi, at Rue du Taciturne, where farmers have set fire to tires. Two sprinklers are on site to try to extinguish the fireplace,” Brussels police said in a statement.

The authorities counted more than 300 tractors pouring into the Belgian capital’s European quarter early on Monday while the ministers held their talks.

Farmer protests have erupted across the continent, including in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy and Spain, over the impact of EU environmental laws, as well as tariff-free imports from Ukraine.

Many farmers argue their traditional, rural ways of life are being destroyed by liberal and metropolitan politicians living in the cities.

Officers closed access to Schuman Square, which is at the heart of Brussels’ European district, after farmers used a cycle lane to get around the barricades set up to keep them away.

A nearby metro station was also closed.

The country is still stagnant though. 

We need a more progressive President to fully push us forward.

Are you being serious in this regard?

> What exactly are you talking about?

The oligarchy.

>I think you're suggesting that a president should be ""strong"" and pass radical reforms with the republican house and a Senate that is 50-50,  where you need 60 votes to pass something.

I think they should be more consistent and vocal about calling out those who halt any form of progression. I also think he should be more strong in removing corrupt individuals from office. He's just playing off of memes atm.

People consider themselves a lot of things... That doesn't mean they're right. 

>Because of the circumstances of that claim, you not only -- in my eyes -- seem to believe that the representation of the nation (Congress) should be the only source of political power and any threat to it can only come from traitors to the nation, but you also seem to believe that there should be a single national identity (and those who do not adhere to it are traitors to the nation). 

Lmao, this is all complete nonsense. Did you create an entire backstory for me off of  a single comment?

>You appear to be the kind of person who thinks if you are not accepting of various cultures moving into the nation, then you are not a true patriot.

I mean... Many of those various cultures literally built this nation into what it is. 

I'm for treating people like people. I'm for freedom of speech and expression. I'm for not restricting the abilities of others.

# Romania

## Liberals  
 
 Won the elections by bashing the socialists on absolutely everything they did. Called them thieves. Said that they were destroying the country. Promissed to never have an alliance with them.

 Called out the culture of having as many mayors, and the whole country is set up to have a plethora of mayors and worthless birocracy, so that the ruling barons can put their children in meaningless jobs for free money.
 
 The second they won the elections, they accepted a whole bunch of candidates from said socialist party. I think that almost 20% of the current liberals are ""ex"" socialist members. 

 Liberals promised technocrats in positions of power. Instead, they hired their nieces and nephews as leaders in all sorts of institution, with absolutely no knowledge on the matter. People who aren't just useless, but rather impede the normal process of things and make all the other employees life miserable. 

Because the liberals didn't have parilment majority, they had to take on another party and form an alliance. This party is actual technocrats and people that could do some real good, but I think they have like 5% of the votes, maybe more, but under 10%. 

The liberals blame their allies for everything, pay news and media to do the same. The prime minister even fired several ministers from that party, because they were getting too nosy. 

In the midst of the worst pandemic of our lifetimes, they're conspiering to obtain a huge wod of cash from the EU to dispense to their minions (the mayors). USR, the allied party wouldn't really let them on with the charade, another USR minster gets fired. Governament disolves in the middle of the 4th wave.

Remember all those pictures with covid deaths, where most of europe is green, the east is red, romania was __BLACK__? Well, we didn't have a governament those days. At all.

The president gave Ciolos, new leader of USR a joke job. To form the new governament. When in reality, there was not a single chance in hell he could have. Just toying with him like it was a mother fucking game.

Meanwhile our hospitals are burning, people dying, the economy is in the shitter. 

Our prime minister is a fucking moron. But he's also a puppet for the president, and does his job of being a puppet so well, that the president backs him up, just so that the puppet can take all the heat, when in reality it's all the president's fault. 

I repeat, the liberal's whole campaign, for the last 4 years, has been ""The socialists are insane, corrupt murderers"". So guess what, once the governament fell, they allied. Formed majority. You know why and how? Loads of EU cash to steal, incoming. 

## The socialists

The socialists are right scumbags they are. Destroying the legal system, to get their leader out of jail. Releasing murderers and rapists in the process. Bunch a girls get murdered. The police got a call form one of the soon to be murdered girl and laugh in her face. Next day she was found burnt alive. 

Socialists did some okay stuff, cuz they're populists. Raised salaries of doctors enough so that not each and every last one of them would leave the country. Raised the pension to where people could conceivably ALMOST survive on it. So a lot of the plebeans give them a pass. Meanwhile, these motherfuckers are stealing hospitals form people. Literally, stealing, hospitals.

So then a bunch of hospitals start catching fire.

> ""There's no way we could prevent this."" Said the only nation where this regularly happens.

How it works is that the bids for everything are held in such a way that no one can show up. Then held a couple of times more. Price increases, only one firm shows up. Some guy's nephew or some such. He wins by default. Does the shoddies job you've ever seen. Gets paid 3 times what you'd pay in Germany. Hospital catches fire. Governament reacts with surprisedpikachu dot jay-peg. 

Bunch of socialists get caught receiving the most stupid of bribes you've ever seen. Several tons of tin. Shit like that. These guys just want bribes. Doesn't even matter if it's usable. It has to be in the form of a bribe ffs. 

Ah more hospital shenanigins. They have a huge space and budget for a mega hospital. Top of the line. Modern. But the project already fell through after spending millions of euro on feasibility tests. After the probject is already shitcanned, there's a TV spot on some governament bitch saying how work has been started and you can see digging in the background. Meanwhile, after that shoot, crafts and services come. All the actors eat, and everyone packs up and leaves cuz there's never gonna be a hospital there.

Pandemic hits, and the above area I just mentioned becomes a ""modular hospital"" with millions of euros from the EU. Ofc, it's just a facade. It wasn't meant to be real. But then the pandemic is way worse than people expected and it actually gets used. Then it bursts into flames. 

## The people

Fucking sheeple. Our media is completely bought. It's Russia, it's parilment, it's corrupt officials, it's rich barrons. So there's no worthwhile information anywhere on TV. Not a single channel. Romanian facebook ain't better. The organization that is supposed to fine missinformation and the such is run by some oligarch's mistress or some shit. It doens't do shit. 

Because of all the propaganda that these mouth breathers are eating by the shovel, no one is getting vaccinated. Because of that they get sick and go to the hospital and fucking burn alive. 

## The church

Our church is legitimately a mafia. There has been a huge expose by a private independant news organization that exposed how the grand whatever. I'm not religious. I'll call him ""THE POPE"" for simplicity. The Pope has a criminal organization that extracts hundreds of millions from the governament.

Meanwhile they spread covid missinformation. Don't let priests preach anything that would even suggest to people to get vaccinated. Use one spoon to spread infection. Literally killing hundreds of thousands.

## Hospitals

Wanted to have a separate point, but I managed to talk the subject to death already. They on faya 🔥

## Water

Old infrastructure is collapsing. Cities starting to not have acces to hot water, and heat in general. The oposing party blaming the current party for not fixing it overnight. The current party blaming the old one for not fixing for the last decade. 

Both parties only really trying to get funds so that they can make said funds disappear.

And who really thought that photographers or artists wouldn't edit their photos?  Of course they will, that's the part of this kind of art ! 

I just wanna let you know that this is composite picture, the cabin, snow, view etc are shooted at one time and they are really real and the milky way is shooted in other time and in other place (but it's also real, not fake). 

In Lapland you can see stars clearly and even milky way, but this artist (RoniShots aka Roni Nieminen) has wanted to use his artistical freedom to make this beautiful piece of art. So the place and view really exist, and I can say it's really beautiful place and worth of seeing (it's like sight) :) 

And by the way, would be nice (and very high recommended) if people who share others pictures would credit the original maker. 

So there's that.

r1sl5o,"I agree with you. I guess what I would say in my defense is that I said ""for the most part."" 😂

But you're right, the electoral college also took the ultimate vote out of the hands of the people, which was seen as a way of preventing populist demagogues from gaining power and destroying the system from the inside (obviously it is NOT doing that anymore - if it ever did - and that's due to a whole host of issues).

The Senate was originally designed to do this as well. Senators were originally elected by State Legislatures, but that was changed by the 17th amendment to stop state officials from buying and selling senate seats (obviously this still happens in certain circumstances as well - see Rod Blagojevich).

That doesn't change the fact, however, that the electoral college kind of...smoothed the power curve between the big states and smaller states. The main problem, as I see it with the electoral college, is that we stopped growing the House of Representatives, which has tipped the scales disproportionately toward the small states.

I personally think many of our problems could be solved by watering down the House with more members. The big states would gain back proportional amounts of power both in the electoral college and in the House (and therefore the budget). I'd also be in favor of increasing the number of senate seats to 3 per state so there's an election every two years instead of the lopsided 2 elections per 6 years we have now. This might serve to increase voter participation in the system.",2021-11-25 16:08:06

Aside from that, court orders were entirely enforceable pre-brexit, so that’s just a failure of the fucking tories. Aside from that, your one-off anecdote falls apart when considering that non-uk citizens are already charged larger deposits / required to pay advances / place holdings in frozen accounts as a precaution, and that was also the case before brexit. You’re essentially describing a market that avoids any international tenancy while simultaneously being massively dependent on an international workforce.",2021-05-15 13:34:45
ncda4s,"> And I will remind you, I am not from britain or europe. As an Australian, I think you all need to grow thicker skin and do what is right for your native populations

You don't need to remind me, I know that you're Australian. And therefore I don't think you're quite as impartial as you present yourself here. Your perception is most likely skewed towards the British side given the language barrier and the cultural connection. I'm not trying to insult you but I don't see you as a true neutral in this discussion. Let me remind you that I'm neither British, German or French. I am what they would probably refer to as an Eastern European ... I care little about hurt egos of British redditors.

> I haven't noticed a trend of British people crying about brexit. If I had, I would be on whatever the british subreddit is, asking what it is about brexit that makes them cry, but I am here.

> I've seen a lot of Europeans that ridicule and hate on the UK for leaving (not necessarily in this thread, just in general) and I don't understand why.

There is that ""neutral"" perspective of yours. I don't know what to tell you except that I have noticed what you apparently didn't. Maybe we're not looking and noticing the same things?

By **Just Asking Questions™** you're perpetuating the idea that Brits are victims of the mean Europeans. A victim complex if there ever was one.

Others can ask questions too. Let me just say, as a neutral, I get the perception that Australians really hate foreigners and aboriginals and I don't understand why. Now discuss. And let me just remind you, I'm a neutral.

See how that works? I get to set tone of the discussion by making an unsubstantiated claim and then let you try and tell me otherwise. I can always claim neutrality and say ""its just my perception"". That is not fair statement nor a genuine discussion.

In any case, I told you my answer in the first reply. I don't believe there is any more ""hate"" or ""ridicule"" coming towards Brits than there was before. Seeing as this is Reddit and English being the lingua franca I just notice more Brits crying about ""mean Europeans"" than actual ""mean Europans"". Keep in mind this is still a minority, before I get accused of saying all Brits are like that.

Again, don't expect Eastern Europeans to feel sympathy for hurt British egos. We are more often than not the butt of jokes. We are racist, xenophobic, lazy, job-stealing, backwards chauvinists to a lot of ""Westerners"" including the British. This hurt pride coming from the Brits here is just ridiculous. European Union and Europe is not just British, German and French.",2021-05-15 12:04:57

We actually created all the civilisations! Mezopotamia-> MEZŐ-potamia (mező means field in the ancienttongue aka hungarian)!

>While employing simple quantitative criteria may seem straightforward, it can also be perceived as potentially problematic. According to some scholars the quantitative approach to defining microstates suffers from such problems as ""inconsistency, arbitrariness, vagueness and inability to meaningfully isolate qualitatively distinct political units""[2]  
>  
>###Qualitative definitions   
>  
>In response to the problems associated with the quantitative definitions of microstates, some academics have suggested finding states with unique features linked to their geographic or demographic smallness.[2][10][13] Newer approaches have proposed looking at the behaviour or capacity to operate in the international arena in order to determine which states should deserve the microstate label.[13][14] Yet, it has been argued that such approaches could lead to either confusing microstates with weak states[7][10] (or failed states) or relying too much on subjective perceptions.[2]  
>  
>###Microstates as modern protected states  
>  
>In order to address both the problems with quantitative approaches and with definitions based on qualitative features, it has been argued that a useful and meaningful way to isolate microstates from other types of states, would be to see them as ""modern protected states"".[2] According to the definition proposed by Dumienski (2014): ""microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.""[2] Adopting this approach permits limiting the number of microstates and separating them from both small states and autonomies or dependencies.[2] Examples of microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco, Niue, Andorra, the Cook Islands or Palau.  
>###Historical anomalies and aspirant states  
>  
>A small number of tiny sovereign political units are founded on historical anomalies or eccentric interpretations of law. These types of states, often labelled as ""microstates,"" are usually located on small (usually disputed) territorial enclaves, generate limited economic activity founded on tourism and philatelic and numismatic sales, and are tolerated or ignored by the nations from which they claim to have seceded.  
>  
>One example is the Republic of Indian Stream, now the town of Pittsburg, New Hampshire—a geographic anomaly left unresolved by the Treaty of Paris that ended the U.S. Revolutionary War, and claimed by both the U.S. and Canada. Between 1832 and 1835, the area's residents refused to acknowledge either claimant.  
>  
>Another example is the Cospaia Republic, which became independent through a treaty error and survived from 1440 to 1826. Its independence made it important in the introduction of tobacco cultivation to Italy.  
>  
>Another is Couto Misto, disputed by Spain and Portugal, that operated as a sovereign state in its own right until the 1864 Treaty of Lisbon that partitioned the territory, with the largest part becoming part of Spain.",2020-01-25 03:22:06

m5g7es,"First Balkan War: Montenegro declared war on Ottoman empire to test if Austro-Hungary would attack in wich case Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria would jump in to help. Since AH didn't attack rest of the allies declared war on OE. Montenegro sends it's forces south and east, Serbia  goes south, Greece- north and Bulgaria south and East.

Serbia takes over Macedonia and North Albania (wich they were forced to give up by AH and Germany (same as Greece)), Bulgaria gets Aegean sea and has been fighting OE around City of Edirne (Adrianople). Serbia sends General Stepa Stepanović with 2nd Serbian Army strengthened by Cannons and Howitzers(wich BG didn't have at the time). BG and S took over Edirne and on London convention OE looses most of the TODAYS territories in Balkans.

Bulgaria was greedy and wanted territories fought for by Serbia and Greece that they didn't get in the end. S and G gave up Albanian territories and Albania was formed.
_______________________________________________________

2nd Balkan War: Bulgaria, without declaration of war, Attacks Serbia and Greece advancing in Macedonia and along the whole S-BG border. S and G push BG back in M and a part of S army moves north. Romania jumps in to take over disputed territory around Dobrich. Turkey declares war on Bulgaria and takes back the City of Edirne. Romania came on 10ish km of Sofia and Greece was rushing towards it..
_______________________________________________________

Aftermath: Serbia got to around 90k km², Greece around  110 km² Romania got the south Dobrich region. And Turkey got Edirne.. AGAIN!

You quote the Mayo Clinic; and they refer to the AAP for the ""health benefits"".

Ah yes: the American Academy of Pediatrics LOL 😀

According to the AAP — they are *not* pro-circumcision. Their wording was very careful — they don't *recommend* it, but they do *justify access* to it. And later in the report they state:  *“...health benefits are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision.”*

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/585

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/e756

And yet Dr. Andrew L. Freedman, one of the senior members of the ""task force"" on circumcision for the AAP has now clearly stated:

*""To many, especially in the lay press, this was interpreted as moving the needle from a neutral stance, as the 1999 guidelines were viewed, to being pro circumcision.""* [ie: the lay press were wrong].

Freedman has now come out and admitted, that the AAP ""report"" was nothing more than a sap to ""multiculturalism"" and that they took numerous non-medical issues into consideration, whilst at the same time stating that were doing the opposite: *""although we claim authority in the medical realm, we have no standing to judge on these other elements.""* And yet — that's *exactly* what they did!

So the AAP has now admitted, that their ""medical"" report was really about just allowing religious people to continue their sexual abuse and mutilation of infant boys.

[AAP Link here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/04/04/peds.2016-0594.extract?maxtoshow=&hits=2&RESULTFORMAT=&andorexacttitle=and&andorexacttitleabs=and&fulltext=circumcision&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&usestrictdates=yes&resourcetype=HWCIT&ct=)

The American Academy of Pediatrics is a *trade* organisation, and exists for the promotion of its members - paediatric doctors. It is not, and never will be, a *patient* advocacy group.

The AAP members make millions of dollars from circumcision infant baby boys, and millions more from selling the amputated foreskins for medical research and cosmetics:

http://www.foreskin.org/f4sale.htm

And even more money fixing ""botched"" circumcisions — which can be 20% of their income! See below.

*“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”*

― Upton Sinclair, I, Candidate for Governor: And How I Got Licked

Many other sane pediatric association from around the world has declared the AAP's stance to be against all sane, rational analysis.

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896.full.pdf+html

The British Medical Journal also published an extensive critique:

http://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2013/03/19/journal-of-medical-ethics-special-issue-on-circumcision/?q=w_jme_blog_sidetab

Also the Journal of Medical Ethics:

http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2013/03/18/medethics-2013-101346.abstract

The Danish Society of Family Physicians has even declared male ""circumcision"" to be genital mutilation. Other countries in Europe will soon follow:

*“The National Board of Health has sent Guidelines Regarding Circumcision of Boys into hearing. DSAM (Danish Society of Family Physicians) has debated the issue and agreed that circumcision may only be performed when medical indication is present. Circumcision in the absence of a medical indication is mutilation.”*

Plus, the circumcision policy committee of the APP had many members with a conflict of interest, not least because of their religious belief in the requirement by their God to have their sons' penises mutilated as a sign of their devotion and love.

These people are terrified that the general public is going to get wise to this child-abuse and ban it.

Dr. Andrew Freedman was one of the members of the committee, and was asked:

*""Do you have a son and, if so, did you have him circumcised?""*

""Yes, I do. I circumcised him myself on my parents’ kitchen table on the eighth day of his life. But I did it for religious, not medical reasons. I did it because I had 3,000 years of ancestors looking over my shoulder.""

http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/new-york-minute/fleshing-out-change-circumcision

So he didn't have 100 million years of human evolution and Charles Darwin looking over his shoulder then? *Every* male mammal in the animal kingdom is born with a foreskin, so it evolved for *reasons*.

Not only that, Dr. Andrew Freedman makes 20% of his income from treating circumcisions that have gone wrong! (But note that *every* circumcision is a botch job). So he makes $500 a pop for circumcising boys, and then more $$$$ for fixing the problems!

*""As a practicing pediatric urologist, 20% of the patients I will see today are here because of something related to their circumcision.""*

http://www.amednews.com/article/20120903/health/309039955/4/

Here is the AAP policy statement. Can you please point me to the section where there task force members state their ""conflicts of interest""? (Hint: you won't find it because it doesn't exist):

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/08/22/peds.2012-1989.full.pdf+html

Note that as three of the task force members were women; and the rest men all born before 1980, there is a very high degree of certainty that none of them possess a male foreskin.

In addition, at least four of them subscribe to a set of theological beliefs that require them to mutilate the genitals of their infant sons. And one of whom (as detailed previously) did so on his kitchen table. Not only is this in violation of the AAP’s code of bioethics prohibiting physicians from conducting surgery on family members (let alone in non-sterile environments), it also provides additional evidence of a pro-circumcision bias among the hand-picked task force members.

These people will mutilate your penis just because they think it pleases their sky-god. Forget about ""medical benefits"".

And recently, Steven Svoboda, a Harvard educated lawyer who runs ""Attorneys for the rights of the child"", debated two of the AAPs ""Taskforce on Circumcision"" members: Michael Brady, M.D. and Douglas Diekema, M.D.:

*""Asked if people present could explain the functions of the foreskin Brady said, “I don't think anybody knows the functions of the foreskin,” then reiterated, in nearly identical words, “Nobody knows the functions of the foreskin.” I noted that there was not a word about the functions of the foreskin in the 2012 AAP report, and asked, shouldn't we know something about the functions of the healthy body part that is being removed?""*

Tellingly, the AAP pamphlet ""Care of the Uncircumcised Penis"", used to contain this information:

*""The glans at birth is delicate and easily irritated by urine and feces. The foreskin shields the glans; with circumcision, this protection is lost. In such cases, the glans and especially the urinary opening may become irritated or infected, causing ulcers, meatitis, and meatal stenosis. Such problems virtually never occur in uncircumcised penises. The foreskin protects the glans throughout life"".*

But this was deleted in the 1996 reprint, and despite numerous letters to the editors, no explanation was ever given as to why it was removed. Of course the reason is obvious: they want to deny that the male foreskin has any function at all, so they can continue to mutilate infant boys.

http://www.circumcision.org/pamphlet.htm

The foreskin is not ""just a little bit of skin."" The foreskin is a complex, double-layered fold of flesh, laden in thousands of nerves and blood vessels. Keep in mind that as a child grows into a man, his foreskin grows too; it isn't so little by the time the child is an adult. And adult foreskin can be from 12 to 15 square inches in size.

The foreskin is not a birth defect.

Neither is it a congenital deformity or genetic anomaly akin to a 6th finger or a cleft.

Neither is it a medical condition like a ruptured appendix or diseased gall bladder.

Neither is it a dead part of the body, like the umbilical cord, hair, or fingernails.

The foreskin is not ""extra skin."" The foreskin is normal, natural, healthy, functioning tissue, with which all boys are born; it is as intrinsic to male genitalia as labia are to female genitalia.

Unless there is a medical or clinical indication, the circumcision of a healthy, non-consenting individual is a deliberate wound; it is the destruction of normal, healthy tissue, the permanent disfigurement of normal, healthy organs, and by very definition, infant genital mutilation, and a violation of the most basic of human rights.

Genital mutilation, whether it be wrapped in culture, religion or “research” is still genital mutilation, and it needs to stop NOW.",2019-07-24 01:20:47

A city where you can bike, walk and have public transport on top offers more options than one that only leaves room for cars.


> BEST AT CARRYING STUFF,

Look at the cars around you. How many during morning commute are carrying stuff? How many are holding 4 passengers?

What good is it that they are ""best"" at it when they don't do it? At that point you may as well use a different mode of transport which doesn't eat tons of space

> HAVING PRIVACY,

Ah, yes, you mentioned needing privacy for riding with family or friends.

Again, look at the cars around. How many (yours included) hold family or friends?

Cars are used to often with many of the features you tout so high of unused. For those trips we shouldn't be using cars.

> FREEDOM

You said you sit stuck behind other cars and that there isn't enough parking space. Standing still and being trapped in a car isn't freedom in the city. It's Stockholm syndrome

He also was not really safe there, as we saw with the Kremlin's assassinations of Skripal in the UK and that other guy who was gunned down in Germany.

He knew he was going to be arrested and likely killed if he returned to Russia, but doing so gave him his best chance to effect some kind of political change. It also meant that there would be no questions about who would be responsible for his death. Absolutely everyone knows his murder was on the Kremlin's orders.

He did but not from China but from social media tech giants like Reddit, Instagram, Facts and YouTube.

Also the “Russia Collusion” of the 2016 election is a proven hoax.

>Didnt US and China permanently fight over Taiwan for the last years ? Didnt US put a technology embargo on China ?

I have no idea what you are trying to say here.

>What you say has absolutely no sense when compared to reality. Trump did receive help from Putin

The one who has absolutely no sense of reality is you since Putin didn’t help Trump in any way.

>and do speeches against supporting Ukrainia (How convenient 🙂), 

The US economy is in a recession. Constant money laundering on Ukraine worsens that recession. Americans shouldn’t have to pay for foreigners’ wars.

Trump is also an anti-war advocate and wants to end the nonstop bloodshed in the war in Ukraine. An entire generation of Ukrainian men has perished because of this war.

>while American administration didnt become more friendly with chinese one under Biden.

Xi just recently visited California and was welcomed lavishly like a Roman emperor as if he was the president of USA and not Biden. Biden’s son received millions of dollars from China and since 10% of that went to Biden, Biden received millions of dollars from China too.",2024-02-16 13:25:44

114c30z,Kosovo es Srbija🇷🇸,2023-02-17 13:59:21
114c30z,"Just plain facts 

Bill Clinton invented some kind of struggle for the democracies of the Albanian national minority in Serbia in order to cover up the Lewinsky Affair, divert attention 

In 1999, before Bill Clinton's aggression against Serbia (the American people did not know it), he declared the biggest lie ever in the history of mankind--- Bill Clinton literally lied that the Serbs killed 100,000 Albanians🙄

There was no such lie with Goebbels either In order for the American people to understand what a lie it is - at that moment in Kosovo, a total of 467 people of all nations had died in inter-ethnic conflicts. He turned 467 victims of all nations (that's the UN report for Kosovo since then) into 100,000 dead Albanians in order to send over 1,000 planes to little Serbia 

Bill Clinton kidnapped the old Serbian land 

Consider the following example of the American people - hypothetically, in 200 years, one part of America will be majority Mexicans and they will rebel and want their country outside of America. Of course, America would not allow that 

In 1400, only 5% of Albanians lived in Kosovo on the holy Serbian land. Then, with the help of other invaders (Turkey, Mussolini in WW2, etc.), they expelled most of the Serbs 

Even in 1890, Serbs were the majority. Only from around 1920 did Albanians become the majority, especially when in 1945-1960 Albanians from Albania entered Kosovo and formed the majority. 

Albanians from Kosovo carried out terrorist actions against Serbia, but Bill Clinton overnight turned the terrorist organization UCCK (KLA) into ""Freedom Fighters"". 

It is very strange how the Albanians could behave like that, ask to secede from the state of Serbia as a national minority and be helped by the West, but when it comes to Russians in Donbas or Serbs in Croatia, then the West has double standards? 

Do the American people know that Clinton's people, Wesley Clark, NATO generals who participated in the bombing of Serbia invested huge sums of money in Kosovo? Do the American people know that Bill Clinton is a war criminal who attacked a sovereign state? 

If America supports the sovereignty of Ukraine, why did it violate the sovereignty of Serbia????",2023-02-18 19:57:02

114c30z,"> Yes, if NATO troops had invaded Serbia to ""liberate"" Kosovo and then claimed it was the will of the Kosovans, I would indeed not have been able to trust that.

Did Russia invade Georgia to “liberate” South Ossetia and Abkhazia? I thought they were already de facto independent from their breakaway wars with Georgia in the 90s?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Abkhazia_(1992–1993)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991–1992_South_Ossetia_War

You sound confused.

> Yes, if NATO troops had been on the ground in Kosovo and NATO officials had ran day-to-day governance, that would indeed have prevented Kosovo from forming a functional independent state.

I think some would argue that without foreign help with governance then Kosovo wouldn’t have been able to form a functioning state. The OSCE Mission’s interim government basically laid the foundations for the Kosovo state. How much do you know about the history of Kosovo?

> And if the Kosovan state budget almost completely consisted of NATO ""donations"" rather than local income or taxes, I would indeed not have felt Kosovo was a viable independent state.

How much money do you think was given to Kosovo after Yugoslavia broke up? How much money do you think they still get? How much do you think Serbia gives them yearly in aid? I’d confidently say it’s more than Russia spends on Abkazhia or South Ossetia lol.

> All combined, yeah, I would have agreed Kosovo was little more than a NATO puppet.

114c30z,">The most part of organ trafficking accusations were debunked, and nothing was proven by the investigations. 

Really?? I see that the investigations are still ongoing and nothing is debunked or disproven. 

This is an older article, but the things did not change a lot since then according to wikipedia
https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/news/kla-guerrillas-harvested-murdered-serbs-organs-say-eu-investigators/ 

So it's my understanding Kosovars, according to you, are not ready to admit their part of guilt (besides the organ harvesting)?


> I hope Moldova reunites with Romania soon. 🇷🇴

I hope not because that would probably mean a new separatist war or Moldova losing 2/3 of its territory (Gagauzia and Transnistria). Sorry but i wanna die in my bed not on the battlefield.",2023-02-17 10:05:44

St Patricks day.. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fT1jPfD67n4


No but wow, i never knew Ireland's population was so small, i'd always thought it was more like 10-30 million, i mean the way Ireland is talked about and how it has such a big presence and soft power on the world stage one always gets the impression that Ireland has a waaaay bigger populace than it actually does. But just how and why does Ireland have so much soft power??.. 


Anyhoo i had some Guinness flavoured crisps yesterday, they were on offer, very nice they were too, not bad at all. So that was my way of joining in the St Patrick's Day celebrations. Also off topic but one of the hottest, sexiest pairs of feet i've ever seen were on a Irish guy.. seriously his soles & toes were to die for. Beautiful feets!👣🇮🇪😍. So hot. And with that anecdote, that's all my experience of all things Irish(along with drinking Guisness and Bailey's etc). Not much i know, but thats it. For whatever reason sadly we dont learn anything about Ireland at school in England, i remember how it was hardly mentioned, Ireland judt doesnt feature here on the cirriculum. I digress...

But very lovely people, hard working and you can buy the best fish over there. They are fishermen and the fleet goes up to the north sea close to the UK for fishing. Major fishing hub. 

The Urker people wear a typical golden  [earring](https://www.google.com/search?q=urker+oorbel&client=ms-android-samsung&prmd=ismvn&sxsrf=ALeKk03BMqvoDYtoZUQi4oV5zRLeNjFhpg:1593332100159&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid9trOiKTqAhVPDOwKHfk9C6wQ_AUoAXoECAwQAQ#imgrc=e_JVE5L5obQcrM), which used to be that if they would fall overboard of their fishing boats the people on the shore finding their body could sell the ring and use the money for a proper funeral.

On the other hand, I know of a story of a guy who wanted a bigger yard so just bought the house next to his, dug a hole and shoved it in there. Which is  illegal here in the NL. They only found out years later when excavating for something else.

Also. When going out to bars in Lemmer (town close by), if the Urkers would come you would be guaranteed to have fights all night lol.

But then again, my parents befriended quite a few Urkers and they sometimes give them huge smoked salmons or other fish product randomly as a gift. An Urker always pays his debt, and takes care of his close ones.

You are correct, we didn't care to do anything about it in the previous 27 years, but that's because the Belarusians themselves didn't seem to care, at least never to the current extent. Bringing Freedom™ to those who do not want it is not our domain. But now that they are begging for our help and attention while being pulled from the streets and straight into rape vans as payback for daring to want to be free, we could not remain silent. I know it's hard to believe in this jaded realpolitik world, but it's still a touchy and emotional subject to some, there were a lot of Lithuanians who went to Ukraine to fight, you know.

Also, there's the factor of Lukanshenka reneging on his role as the supposed protector of Belarusian sovereignty and promising to finally merge into the Union State, in no uncertain terms. Prior to this ridiculously rigged election, there was a period rapprochement, Lithuania was shipping Norwegian oil day and night to Belarus by rail because Luka had had a falling out with Putin and had allowed their oil contracts to expire, US had announced that they would be sending an ambassador to Belarus again, and previous EU sanctions were lifted, so there was some naivete about changes possibly occurring in the regime, and a willingness to spur them on and to play along.

But seriously i'd have to say if you wanna find out more about The Vikings there's a great 3-part BBC series from 2012(its simply called Vikings) by Scottish historian & archeologist Neil Oliver, its the best series on the vikings ive seen imo. It goes into alot of depth and detail, the wider context, plus it explores pre-Viking Scandanavian culture and peoples as well, not just the usual blood and guts, war, raping n pilaging affair etc, its partly about why the Vikings did what they did and how & why they became what they became, their legacy etc. You should defo give it a watch if you wanna find out more about the Vikings. I highly reconmend it. Its easily the best programme on the vikings that ive seen imo. Also recently here in the uk i've been watching a new series here in the uk called Viking Dead(its a follow up to the previous series: Medival Dead) etc. Its a show exploring in depth the Viking era through the history of Viking archeology. Its a good watch too.",2018-11-22 12:31:33

154m800,"I'm not even muslim and I'm not defending anything which was done to the man mentioned in the post, also I agree that no one should be suffering in any country just because of their sexuality. I just want to clear a few misunderstandings ❤️:


~Even if the enforcement of the law is pretty much fucked up, Turkey isn't ruled under Sharia, so being homosexual isn't directly a crime. The east of the country is a bit more bigoted, but the rest, especially the coasts, main centers of tourism (İzmir, İstanbul, Antalya etc.) are chill about LGBTQ. 

I accept that in pride month the police forces are so harsh over the protestors, (the guy mentioned in the post also was misunderstood as one of the protestors), and opening LGBTQ flags all around is a bit problematic in the perspective of goverment too. 

Briefly, being individually homosexual isn't something you should be so scared of in Turkey, I have a lot of friends who are openly homosexual and they never witnessed any problems by their environment. The only point where you can encounter legal problems because of your sexuality is stuff like attending large protests etc. 

And this part is a bit sad but, Turkish police is usually softer towards tourists since they are more persistent about defending their rights. (An example, 2021(?), the police didn't stand back from using pepper sprays and plastic guns over the crowd, but since this woman is a foreigner they aren't taking action: https://youtube.com/shorts/qcueaS_tFgI?feature=share9 )

~Sentence of death is illegal in Turkey since 2005, and even before it was illegal, it was so rarely used that it has never been used since 1984.

Tbh if I was you, I wouldn't visit Turkey either out of all countries. But if you have to one day, know that you are safe as long as you don't take action in protests etc. 

Have a nice day ❤️",2023-07-20 19:08:14

154m800,"Something haven't the same punishment doesn't mean it's equally as bad. There's guys in Texas who got caught with some pot brownies serving a longer sentence than child molestors. Doesn't mean weed is worse than pedophilia. 

Islamic scholars for centuries have classified 2 different acts of punishment. Qisas and Hudud. 

Qisas is considered the worst act as it is when you commit a vile crime deserving of capital punishment on someone. 


Qisas included crimes like Rape, Adultry(specifically cheating) and murder. Those found guilty of those actions and a few others that don't come to mind right now will be faced with Qisas. Again Qisas is generally classified as the worst punishment possible as you aren't just infringing on God you're infringing on another human being. With these acts if ample evidence is there then the punishment can be carried out. 

Hudud includes crimes that just have their punishment in the Quran. They aren't viewed as a crime against God and mandkind, just as a crime against God. That can be anything from theft to premarital sex. However unlike Qisas with the slightest doubts the punishment should not be carried out. I mean even in the case of homosexuality or premarital sex you have to essentially admit to publically committing the crime before you get charged for the punishment and if the other party doesn't admit it then the other party doesn't get punished. 

After all this if you someone how still believe that homosexuality is viewed to be as bad as murder than feel free man 🤷‍♂️ idk what to tell you.",2023-07-22 00:53:16

A - Being pro-Western is not equivalent to being good.

B - policies on organized crime ? Just curious do you know any politicians who make the stance ""Crime is good we should increase it""  on election time ?

>(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Zoran_%C4%90in%C4%91i%C4%87). At least in English Wikipedia there is nothing about his supposed crimes.

That's the article on his assassination and not on him.

But more to the point, nothing I said is in dispute. The guys who assassinated him (Zemunski klan) were ran and it's members were  people from JSO.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zemun_Clan

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Unit_(Serbia)

While JSO was trying to assassinate Vuk Draskovic (another opposition leader) 2 times, they made a deal with Djindjic :) That nobody knows what it included :) This is not in dispute either

>On 4 October, opposition leader Zoran Đinđić met with Milorad Ulemek. Ulemek struck a bargain with Đinđić that he and his unit would stand down as long as the police were not attacked.[18] The unit was most likely given the order to storm the protesters, who rallied in downtown Belgrade on 5 October. But soon after the unit's characteristic armored Hummers appeared in front of the protesters, the vehicles simply returned to base.

One year later, JSO commits a mutiny while Djindjic was the prime minister.

>. In 2001, JSO engaged in a mutiny, blocking the Belgrade-Niš highway.[20] The official reason for the mutiny, was an order given to the unit to arrest the Banović brothers, wanted by the ICTY. After a few days of harsh negotiations, the JSO's mutiny ended.

And nothing happened. Djindjic decided to just forgive them 🤷‍♀️ Not even disband the unit, no punishments at all. Military unit rebelled, and nothing happened.

And this is the kind of things JSO (which Djindjic protected 2 times from being disbanded or punished) did.

>. During 2001, the clan kidnapped several influential businessmen and demanded millions as ransom money. Among those men were Milija Babović and Miroslav Mišković, widely considered to be the most powerful business people in Serbia at the time. In both cases, Ulemek offered his help to the police, in his official capacity. He abused that position and provided insider information to the clan: for example, when he found out that Babović's family quickly and easily collected the ransom money, he advised the clan members to demand more. Eventually, all the hostages were released, however, some were severely beaten and tortured in the process

He was involved or at least pretty friendly and protected known organized criminals.

What he says in his campaign election speeches is irrelevant.",2020-10-05 13:40:19

In March I went there for our annual conference and on my second week there I decided to take a holiday and just chill in the Netherlands. Where to go? Didn't want to do Amsterdam because just didn't want to be around all the other tourist. So I went on google maps and did a little research and found The Hague. My plan was to stay there a few days and then go to Rotterdam for a few days as well. Because I do everything last minute 😩 I booked my Airbnb the night before the end of my business trip in North Holland, and I was super hungover because my Dutch colleagues are party fucking animals, and didn't find anything cool in The Hague however i found a cool little spot in Rotterdam and decided to just go there first. 

OMG was i shocked. This is the best city in all of Europe IMO. The people, the atmosphere, the vibe, the culture, and the streets are all amazing. I hate big cities and after being there I'd now consider living in a big city. I ended up not going anywhere else in NL because I knew I was in the best place.

g5tc10,"Why are you being so rude? I've always found stuff like ""How are you"" and the expected reply ""I'm fine"" rather strange, as well as other things like ""We should get together sometime"" isn't an actual suggestion. North American English colloquialisms are unique in its contradictory meanings. If you think about it, why would you ask someone ""how they are"" when you're not actually interested in the answer? It would make more sense to say a greeting that doesn't falsely imply they want more conversation.

The regional style of language use is not a grammar thing. You're confusing two different concepts. Grammar is the technical structure; the way the grammar is used would be the colloquialisms. How English is spoken can vary depending on where you are in the world, so what you're saying makes no sense. The only thing I can agree with your tasteless reply is that English is a difficult language if you didn't grow up with it. Hell, I know people who only speak English and they don't speak it that well anyways 🙄

g5tc10,After thinking some more about it: I believe I mostly heard the non sarcastic version from Americans. So apologies to the Brits 🙈,2020-04-22 07:47:45
g5tc10,"Yeah. It's all about levels of closeness. If I say this to you and I don't know you well then I probably don't mean it. If I did, I'd take active steps in following up, but if we aren't close then I'm probably being polite in the context of the conversation.

If you're my closer friend then the commitment level is different and the follow on / planning aspects will be different. Firmer timelines. Focused conversation. Ie ""Do you want to grab beers on Friday?"" ""Cool Denizens work?"" ""Sure 7?"" ""Lets do it."" In this context, I know my friend drinks beers, she knows what brewery I like, I know when she gets off work and can join. We have already established somethings based on prior light social exchanges, so the planning is easy and so is the sincerity level of the invitation. 

Also the example given is ""We must have dinner sometime."" I would never say this to a close friend. Must is super formal language and cliche. If we are friends must is too formal, implies we aren't close. The sometimes leaves it open ended. Ie I don't actually intend on taking action here unless you care to force the issue / this might be okay to do but I don't care that much yet or know if I actually I want to spend time with you.

If we aren't close, but I actually want to hang out with you then I'm after your consent. ""What do you think about having dinner on Friday? What are your plans?"" Never ""we must."" Probably not ""should"" either. Those are formal and forceful for social situations where I don't know if you'd be receptive to hanging out as we haven't established a base yet. What do you like? Will you enjoy the experience? Are Europeans really telling American cashiers everything about themselves? :)

I've heard it described as the ""Coconut v Peach"" cultural difference. I lived with Germans at one point, very direct, but as roommates they were open and friendly, but if I met with their German colleagues or friends, hardly any of them would be polite social to me so I assumed they disliked me and I was shocked as fuck when they'd get drunk and become super chatty and friendly with me.

France is a natural ally of Russia's, just as Germany is a natural rival. That's why they've fought together in two world wars and why the French in general have a slightly romantic view of Russia (and of Communism, which is somewhat related), to this day.

If France would be neighboring Russia it would change its tune mighty quickly.

France is the primary threat to Eastern Europe, for example. They'd throw us all under the bus if they could, just to get some economic concessions or whatever from Russia.

I'm not saying that France likes Putin's regime or whatever, France is just looking out for #1 (itself). And for France, having a strong Russia is a decent counter balance to other parties such as Germany.

Now, with the EU, the equation has change slightly, but should the EU falter, France will just naturally revert to overarching geostrategic tendencies.

Edit: French folks, just because you don't like it, doesn't mean I'm right. Especially this part:

> **France is the primary threat to Eastern Europe, for example. They'd throw us all under the bus if they could, just to get some economic concessions or whatever from Russia.**

Most people in Eastern Europe are quite convinced of this, since you did the exact same thing before WW2. We're trying to rely on the Americans, but they're not as reliable as they used to be, we just hope we won't be dog food again 😞",2021-05-24 07:53:00

Pro Russia was a bit much, but France will definitely work together with Russia when it fits French interest, with 0 regard for the morality of the situation.

Just as Germany does, exactly.

For Eastern Europe French interests are extremely low, which means that in case of any relevant conflict, France will for sure abandon Eastern Europe to Russia. Can't really blame them, but can't really like them for that either 😁",2021-05-24 17:59:04
njr5j4,"> France could've veto'd Eastern expansion if it truly wanted. They did not.

France does have economic interests in the region, that eased things. The biggest Romanian bank is part of... drum roll... Société Generale. The biggest Romanian car manufacturer is owned by... Renault. We have Auchan, Carrefour (I think they're the largest supermarket chain in Romania), Leroy Merlin, etc.

I imagine there was a ton of pressure from other EU members, such as the UK, probably Germany, and a lot of horse trading, pork-barrelling. It seems to have worked 🙂

> Just because the UK is more agressive doesn't mean France is buddy buddy with Russia. Lame attempt. France for example was the first to condemn and go against Assad in Syria of all European powers. Directly against Russian interests. So, again, youre wrong.

Well, I think that without public help you get back all the money you inverted in less than 10 years. This is s very good statistic.

But on the other side the electricity laws here in Spain are a mess and change every four years or so and that creates instability that scares investors in renewables. Recently the government cut 2.700 million € of help to renewable companies wich obviously scares them and the power bill is raising every year for the consumer. According to Red Electrica Española (the public regulator of the electrical market) the % of the energy produced with renewabled every year is falling since 2013.

On other terms, Spain is super behind in the CO2 objectives for 2020 and will not be able to reach the target emissions. Rumours are saying that to accomplish this target they are gomna raise the power bill 10% for Spaniards so that with more expensive electricity people consume less. 

To summarise, the electricity laws in Spain are tailored to big multinational companies that love 💰 and windmills and solar panels give less profits. The dangers of generating electricity are being passed to the citizens through the power bill and there is a lot of unrest.",2017-06-17 11:27:12

Some Romanian sources claim that Romania also triggered Article 4.

* Sources says that Japan, Australia and New Zealand politicians repudiated the invasion of Ukraine. We will update the post later with links. 

### **Background:**

*Note: If you need a complete explanation about the events that led to the current invasion by Russia, check the [post in r/OutOfTheLoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sqhno0/megathread_whats_going_on_with_ukraine_and_russia/).

In early 2014, unmarked Russian troops invaded Crimea, which was officially annexed by Russia after holding a referendum that is considered invalid by the global community due to voter intimidation, irregularities during the voting process, vote manipulation and other issues. To this day, the annexation of Crimea has not been recognized internationally. Following the annexation, Western powers have implemented sanctions against various sectors of the Russian economy, which were met by Russian counter-sanctions against western goods. More or less simultaneously, pro-Russian separatists, which are assumed to be backed by Russia, started an uprising in the [Donbass region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas). Ever since, the separatists (the self-proclaimed Luhanks's People Republic and Donetsk People's Republic) have been engaged in a civil war with the regular Ukrainian forces, aided by a steady supply of Russian equipment, mercenaries and official Russian troops. 

During the conflict, [Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17) was shot down by a Russian BUK M1 missile over the conflict area which resulted in the death of 298 civilians. In 2014 and 2015, there were diplomatic attempts to curb the violence in the region through the ceasefire agreements in the protocol of [Minsk and Minsk II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_agreements), negotiated by Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France in the so-called “Normandy Format”. 

In early 2021, Russia amassed roughly 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, which were withdrawn after a while and ongoing diplomatic criticism by other countries. Since the end of 2021, Russia has started deploying troops to the Ukrainian border again. At the time, there was roughly 115,000 Russian soldiers at the Ukrainian border plus another 30,000 Russian soldiers conducting joint military exercises with Belarusian troops near the northern Ukrainian border. 

Western military experts estimate that Russia would need roughly 150,000 Troops to overwhelm the Ukrainian army and successfully annex most of Ukraine, including Kiev. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/what-would-be-russia-military-options-in-ukraine-invasion), [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/world/europe/russia-military-ukraine-border.html))

### **Rule changes effective immediately:**

Since we expect a Russian disinformation campaign to go along with this invasion, we have decided to implement a set of rules to combat the spread of misinformation as part of a hybrid warfare campaign. 

* No unverified reports of any kind in the comments. We will remove videos of any kind unless they are verified by reputable outlets. This also affects videos published by Ukrainian and Russian government sources.

* Absolutely no justification of this invasion.

* No gore

* No calls for violence against *anyone*

* No hatred against any group, **including the populations of the combatants**

### About the Megathreads

The discussion will remain contained to the Megathreads on this issue. We will replace and update them frequently. Individual posts on /r/europe will be allowed for the following cases: 

* Major declarations by either conflict party 

* Substantial military or diplomatic action by third countries

* Major human rights violations

* Occupation of major Ukrainian cities (>1m pop)

We will allow absolutely no picture-only posts on this issue.

t00aon,"Hi lads. I posted this yesterday but my post got deleted. Sharing this here with you.

I am Russian and I just wanted to warn you to never ask Russian opinion on fucking r/Russia. You will most probably get bot or paid troll reply.

How did I figure this out? Well I am not Sherlock but as you know, public on the internet and especially in the parts of internet that requires to be able to speak other languages are overwhelmingly liberal. If you look at actual Russian subreddit it kinda paints a picture of regular antiwar Russian dudes who also don't like western/NATO expansion. It seems probably very believable to you but if you would be able to go to Russian forums and look how liberal public in Russia react to this bullshit - they fucking hate Putin. ill give one example, but you can of course check myself.

[Here](https://pikabu.ru/story/sanktsii_kotoryikh_vse_zhdali_8861622#comments) is the top post today at the resource that somehow resembles Reddit but is Russian - Pikabu. It is about new sanctions from the US. Top comments? Here the post and top comments (don't trust me, translate yourself):

>Санкции, которых все ждали

Sanctions that everybody awaited/wanted

>США объявили о санкциях против детей российских чиновников  
>  
>Под «санкции против элит», введенные властями США в связи с признанием ЛНР и ДНР попали дети Бортникова, Фрадкова и Кириенко, которые занимают руководящие посты в ВТБ, Промсвязьбанке и VK

US announces sanctions against children of Russian officials Under the ""sanctions against the elites"" imposed by the US authorities in connection with the recognition of the LPR and the DPR, the children of Bortnikov, Fradkov and Kiriyenko, who occupy senior positions in VTB, Promsvyazbank and VK, fell under the ""sanctions against the elites""

Sweet part - comments:

>Я не понял, США, получается, за нас?🤔

I didn't get it - USA on our side

>Ещё Симонян, Захарова и самый замечательный патриот Соловьев! Это праздник какой-то

Simonian, Zakharova and out patriot Soloviov! This is great!

>""санкции сам на пользу"" - эти слова только сейчас обретают смысл. Отличный способ подрезать крылья проворовавшихся и заебавшим всех эффективным управленцам и их отпрыскам.

""Sanctions are for our best"" - this words just appear to make sence. Great way to fuck thieves and ""effective managers"" and their fucking kids.

List goes on and I wrote this post a bit earlier, so now top comments are a little different, but there is nobody who likes Putin, they hate everybody in the government and their kids living outside of Russia

Russian liberals hate Putin, we hate his war, hate his constantly involved in corruption officials, we hate his KGB background and we hate that apparently now there are no fucking actual people on the internet - only bots and trolls from his trollfarms. I have to live outside Russia because people like me are not welcomed in Russia. Don't trust anyone who says he is Russian on the internet (especially me).

Edit: forgot to mention that Russian part of the internet is basically now covered in people who see ""hohols"" (derogatory for Ukrainian) anywhere whenever anybody mentions that he does not agree with Putin. For us, it is common and most of us already learned to avoid these bots. I guess, US figured out the power of trollfarms last election and I think there is very little awareness here in EU about that.

The Far Right™ as we currently understand it exhibits a few identifiable traits: They are parochial, hierarchic, violent, and reactionary (as opposed to conservative. They do not simply resist change. Rather they attempt to return society to a perceived simpler time. They are often, though not always, religious, xenophobic, nationalist (or regionalist), and rural or suburban.

Their parochial nature means that they tend to view statements by their in-group over others, regardless of logical or scientific merit. Combined with their tendency to respect and reinforce heirarchies, that means they are often gullible when presented with statements by their social and economic ""betters"" if those ""betters"" are within the perceived in-group. This however, does not make them stupid. There have been several studies that have failed to correlate IQ or rational thinking with political alignment. 

I agree that the modern right wing is largely a reaction to the inequalities inherent to capitalism. It is important to note that all political alignments scapegoat *something or someone* for this inequality (the left blames class divides and the center blames human tendencies towards tribalism) the modern right points towards social and cultural factors as the causes of strife.

sk5cvt,"French is a mixture of all of the above, a somewhat famous example:

""*Nom de Dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperies de connards d'enculé de ta mère*""

\-Merovingian, Matrix

Roughly translates to (pardon my French)

""In God's name of whore of a brothel of shit of ""bitcheries"" of idiots of anal motherfuckers

Which doesn't make sense in either languages, it's just a bunch of swear words in a row, the beauty of it is it sounds like you're ""wiping your arse with silk""...his words, not mine

Cut down into their respective swear category:

* Nom de Dieu/In God's name: Religious
* Putain/whore: Prostitution
* Bordel de merde/Shit brothel: Prostitution and feces; this is a rough translation, both ""bordel"" and ""merde"" are translated into their literal sense but not their prefered translation since ""bordel"" can refer to any messy place, like a poorly organized room
* Saloperies: Prostitution(?); so here's an odd one, I had to take some liberties here because this word has no direct translation, it uses the same root as ""salope""/whore so I improvised but ""saloperie"" itself can describe anything bad, from terrible people to the goddamn table you just stub your toe on, it's just as versatile as ""fuck"" in English
* Connards d'enculé de ta mère: Sexual; This one is a combo, not only are you insulting people's intelligence with ""connards"", you're also implying they were born from their mom's arse as opposed to more conventional ways, google likes to translate ""enculé"" directly to motherfucker when only the anal fuckery is mentioned, it seems most people assume it is implied, granted this is the case here

My point here is swearing in French usually ends up with someone's mom getting fucked, whether as a professional or not is not specified so ""sexual"" should be the main theme

As a side note: the most common insult ""Enculé de ta mère"" devolved to a much simpler ""Ta mère"" which means...""your mom"", yes, French went there too

Bonus round: when talking about politics it's not unusual to hear a ""Pourriture"" to describe members of the opposing party, which is mold, putrefaction, or rot, so we can add disease to the list

I know it's impossible to make an accurate map of something like this since countries with vastly different languages within their borders (like Belgium or Switzerland) will swear differently depending on what language one might speak the most but it's funny nonetheless to realize how passionate everyone is about their hate of those pesky Dinkleflanders™",2022-02-04 09:04:27

Still afaik we Frenchmen have the widest palette of swearings ever. I've tried to swear in English but it’s often the same word, less fun, and I can’t find an equivalent.

But I have to be honest, our favorite swearing is not ""putain"" (= whore) but ""ta mère"" (= your mother). Because when someone talks about your mom it’s often to say ""your mother the whore"" or ""go fuck your own mother"" or ""your mother's ugly-ass"". Say only ""ta mère"" with no proper sentence and French people are going to wish you death.

Great, you have a massive majority based on lies and deceit. This will results in even the people who voted for this to be angry at the result. No matter what the result is, people will feel like they didn't get what they want because the promises and goals were very different at the start of the election campaign and even more so at the start of the brexit referendum. Let's just say I'm sitting here with my popcorn in hand waiting for the show to start.

> Well right now yes but pre COVID we were less of a shit show than all other Major European Nations....so I can live with that 👍

I'm happy for you. I would like to do well in the present and future but if you like to look at the past then go ahead if that makes you happy. If you can, I would recommend looking at britain from pre ww2 and then you would really be happy.

> We'll make your mind up, you were saying we were already in a terrible position, now you have turned into a fortune teller when confronted with actual data. Shock.

Could you point to my original comment where I said that the UK was in a economical shit show? I never mentioned this but I can see how you got this impression. However, I later gave you numerous examples of why I think the UK is covered in shit right now but you didn't mention those specific examples?

eg9vuo,I think your country had with your last general election the chance to vote labour... To have a chance on a second referandum. But the British People choose Boris Johnson... I can't believe that in a such critical situation the pro European People in the UK stayed a second time at home instead to vote a  pro European Party. That why I said you voted twice... Now you have to go! The thought from a United Europe is not to tread the single members... It was build to preserve peace and liberty between the countries after so many wars in Europe during the last 200 years... AND IT WORKS.❤️,2019-12-28 10:07:29

That doesn’t *quite* apply to the U.S. De facto, the Wehrmacht was all they cared about, and the Wehrmacht obeyed its own leaders.

 Submarines that relied less on the torpedos and more on their deck guns earlier in the war had much more success (see: USS Tang under the command of ""Mush"" Mortin). The refusal to trust the submariners that were reporting how bad the torpedoes were for as long as they did still upsets me. And the fact that they didn't learn their lesson (RIP 🦂) still boils my blood.

Also in large part due to tactics. We were trying to use submarines as just another fleet ship in fleet battles for so long. Once we start copying the Germans wolf packs, and especially when we started letting subs go on solo missions (Infamously Barb under Fluckey) we saw gains as well. 

Something good that came out of Pearl Harbor was that it forced the Pacific submarines to try tactics they wouldn't have otherwise, in no small part I think due to the ""ungentlemanly"" nature of a lot of submarine tactics. Its really surprising how much people hated submarines and submariners, considering them essentially pirates for so long. I guess they kind of are and we are just more used to it now, of have accepted the benefits of such.

Basically when Germany is playing or in the finals it’s very good for the sewage system because it was built with a larger population in mind, so it’s too big to effectively move the sewage through the pipes, so it becomes stagnant and smells horrible. Hence the smell in Berlin. 

When the Germans are in the finals they drink a massive amount of beer, and tend to hold it in during the match, all peeing during halftime. 

This effectively flushes the pipes due to amount of national soccer fans. ⚽️🍺🚽",2021-07-07 14:49:13

The whole reason he’s been operating there is because he could. Why did he not traffic women from Finland or any other country? The whole system is corrupt. Basically, there’s poverty, corruption and a low level of education that makes it a heaven for traffickers. 

I’m a hundred percent it was the interpol or another foreign authority who made that happen as well as the publicity of this case. That’s the way to get Romanian authorities to act. Looking at differently is wearing rose tinted glasses. I wish I had nice words about that place, I’m sorry.

>	 Viele Firmen aus Ostdeutschland mussten schließen, während aus Ostdeutschland und Westdeutschland ein Land wurde.

~~Frankly, I would have put an es between während and aus, which would fill in for a subject in a passive sentence, but I’m not a native speaker and maybe it just sounds better without.~~ (I was a very tired non native speaker 🥲) But if the subject must not necessarily come in the first position, why is putting an es there even a thing?

sykxms,"I doubt Putin et al will have failed to predict this. The Kremlin is probably calculating that any such measures will be temporary (note the German government has ""put it on hold"", not cancelled it).  
  
The Kremlin need only wait for the dust to settle and voila - they've gained permanent control of more of the Donbas, possibly with a view to gaining total control over the territory in time; *and* the likes of NS 2 will quietly restart (maybe with a different name?).   
  
Forgive my cynicism, but I think the Kremlin has realised the reluctance of its western rivals to engage directly in military conflict, coupled with a willingness on Russia's part to exert hard power, puts them in a controlling position. I will say it's still nice to see *some* kind of response from Germany, and I trust the rest of Europe will follow suit. I just doubt it'll result in much long-term disadvantage for Putin et al.

If I remember correctly- 60% of German energy supplies come from Russia - without NS2 even flowing… There are a number of energy pipelines from Russia into Europe. In fact - I think that there is something like 100,000 barrels of oil a day of energy equivalent resources entering the USA from Russia. No doubt, the tip of the iceberg! Sanctions need to be utterly crippling across the board for Russia to drive regime change - otherwise they are meaningless.  For sanctions to bite - it takes time, it’s not immediate to cascade through society. Rip access to SWIFT and all international banking processes. Hurt his inner circle, castrate his influence and be 100% prepared for kinetic war.

He and his party have over 2/3 of the mandate in the parlament and the opposition have no chance to stop any constitution modification, this is truly one of the worst case that could have happened to save the hungarians' democracy, but it happened.

If the economy doesn't crush the nation, and the people don't stop trusting these corrupt people, we have no prospect of a true change of government.
Please European Union the European Nations, save our democracy, you are our last chance to save this nation from falling down a rabbit hole from which we cannot get out.

ldrbbi,"If anyone is interested in a really good, recent in-depth documentary series on the Romans etc.. Well there's a really good BBC4 made 4-part one by Ancient Roman/Classics historian Mary Beard, it's called: Meet The Romans. It's more so about the ordinary, everyday people and their stories, it's also about Roman society/culture/history in general but as seen from the bottom up in Ancient Rome not the usual story of Emperor's and generals like those in this pic etc.. Imo Mary Beard is so passionate and enthusiastic about Ancient Rome, she really brings it all to life, brings these people and their stories back to vivid life and detail. She's great at relating this history to us as a modern audience too imo. So yeah I'd defo recommend that anyone reading this should give it a watch.


PS. She also did a good BBC documentary on the Roman Emperor Caligula as well(it's called: Caligula with Mary Beard), that's well worth a watch too.


PS2. Oh and here's something else interesting... [An Ancient Roman speaking English as he shows us how to make Ancient Roman meatballs](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mPsgE12Lpzo)... Oh and here's how to make another two favourites of Ancient Rome, [Ancient Roman roast chicken](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fwa6n-0a490) and an [Ancient Roman beef stew](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pUbvzqLj4Es).. Looks pretty tasty I'll say!😎. But that channel is a great resource if you wanna find out more about and actually see what food the ancient Romans were eating, it brings the whole thing to life. It's amazing how different ancient Roman cuisine is to modern Italian cuisine, really it has little to no resemblance or similarities to modern day Italian food. It's like two entirely different cuisines all together.


PS3. BBC's/HBO's Rome docu-drama is also very good. To date it's still the best drama made on ancient Rome imo, it cost something like $1 million+ an episode such was the high quality and production values they were going for. It's a shame it was cancelled relatively early(due to costs) on as it was very good.",2021-02-06 20:15:14
