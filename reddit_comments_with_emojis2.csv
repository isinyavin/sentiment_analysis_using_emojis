Additionally you’ll reduce your risk of dying young and will have a much better quality of life too! You’ve done the hard bit by finding a way of using more energy than you’re eating so keep it up and you’ll be a lean, mean, fighting machine in no time! 😃👍🏻",2020-01-07 20:04:51

What you have achieved is absolutely amazing. Puberty happens at a later stage for boys then for girl's when it comes to being overweight. The fact that you can achieve that to me proves you can do anything. Don't ever underestimate your ability to achieve anything you set your mind to. Super proud mate, you're younger then me from the look of it and you are going places! I am to but what you have achieved is worthy of applause my friend. Now don't stop there, keep striving for greater and you will head there. I hope the rest of your week is as pleasant as you have made mine. The future is in your hands and everything you believe is possible. Take care.",2020-04-22 08:34:25

Take math for example. You may not use calc or trig directly, but on a meta level you learn how to effectively step through complex problems. Math is the best way of learning that skill, by far. It’s easily applicable to every other aspect of life you have. 

Knowing literature is part of knowing communication skills. If you can parse through a very foreign sounding version of your own language and know the history of it, you become that much better at forming thoughts and creative ways of expression on your own. Again, something very useful in life going forward. 

Also. You’re studying to be an electrician? Ummmmmmmm electricians literally use trig, calc and algebra 🤣 

This is why I called you tryhard. You didn’t put any sort of critical, abstract thought in your analysis. Just said some random shit trying to be edgy or whatever.",2020-03-05 04:32:20

I agree with you to an extent, but there reaches a limit where you’ve learned how to problem solve, and everything after said limit is an unnecessary waste of time because they don’t want to change the curriculum. 

>Knowing literature is part of knowing communication skills. If you can parse through a very foreign sounding version of your own language and know the history of it, you become that much better at forming thoughts and creative ways of expression on your own. Again, something very useful in life going forward.

Yes, I’d again agree. However, again, there reaches a limit to where it becomes redundant and just a way to kill time while calling it an “education”. 

For both of these though, this is not the “best way”. The best way would be to teach problem solving and communication skills to translate into real life application. For example, teaching communication in job interviews, formal emails, and how to talk to children is a much more beneficial style of communication than writing about some irrelevant allusion in a novel, at least towards your later years. 

>Also. You’re studying to be an electrician? Ummmmmmmm electricians literally use trig, calc and algebra 🤣

Yeah, so there’s this thing called self awareness. It’s this little thing that you have when you understand that what benefits you may not benefit the majority. While I personally enjoy Trig (Calc’s a little frustrating), those are very specific skills that do not help the large majority of the population, and therefor should be electives instead of core classes. 

> This is why I called you tryhard. You didn’t put any sort of critical, abstract thought in your analysis. Just said some random shit trying to be edgy or whatever.

No, I didn’t. Just because I don’t agree that we should be second-hand teaching life skills through concepts that not everybody understands or cares about does not mean that I have no point. The broader idea is that core subjects should be made up of things that benefit the most people (personal finance, childcare, healthy physical and emotional habits, first aid and basic medical training, etc.), while classes like Maths, English, and Sciences should be electives for those who *do* actually care about them.",2020-03-05 04:53:04

i8b24e,"Almost same thing happened to me twice.

The first one was 6th Grade, I was a dumb and naive kid back then and have a massive crush on a girl for two years (Let's call her A). One day, she randomly texted me and told me that she ""LIKED"" me. I felt that I was the fucking happiest kid on earth and immediately replied with (forgive what I'm about to do) ""😍 Really me too!"" and then she send this crying emoji and laughing and texted me ""LOL jk hahahaha april fools sucker"" I immediately look at the calendar and saw the date April 1st. April fucking 1st, I forgot that date where people do crazy shit to people and that day, I never talk to her again. (it's been 4 years already and I'm not talking to her)

Second happened recently, 8th Grade. Lunch just started and my friend came over and randomly ask, ""do you have a crush"". I responded with ""Yea, of course"". He immediately ask me who it is and we're going to call her L. Class just finished and it was time to go home, but I felt people were keeping distance from me and I keep wondering why then I immediately saw L and her friend and said to me face to face ""Sorry, I don't like your type"" then exited the room. People looked at me with mixed expressions and when I got home, I felt really fuckin depressed.",2020-08-12 14:40:54
i8b24e,"""Lmao sorry"" is a pain I'm all to familar with. When my dog died, my bully at the time got my nimber through my friends phone and texted me ""hey i heard your dog died 😂"" and when I said it did he said ""lmao sorry"". And I've been rejected that way a few times as well.",2020-08-12 13:17:24

The winner either picks the loser's crush or someone that is considered an outcast/gross. Got asked out a couple times, I was in the outcast spectrum but like anyways one time a boy who I kinda liked had to ask me out and he basically kept whispering ""please say no, please say no"" really made me feel ✨Great✨.

i8b24e,"Being a female myself I think I can say this without getting verbally slapped in the face, but when girls do shitty crap like this to guys it is horrible, and then those same exact girls probably complain about getting lead on and played, but if a guy was sad about it he’d most likely be told to “man up.”
Honestly, I feel bad for y’all genuinely decent and warm-hearted guys that get treated like utter shit, I have kinda dealt with girl issues myself concerning this kinda
“Oh I like you.” 
“It’s for a tik tok.” Shittyness, I date girls and people at my school for a while used it as a source of entertainment to just send me a message which was a lot like this post, one of the girls I did actually like, but you’ve just gotta push on and find the right people that you love for the right reasons and life gets that bit better, love y’all and have a good night/good morning 💕",2020-08-23 19:37:29

The people that tell you that you’re not good enough or that you should or should not feel a certain way are the people whose opinions you shouldn’t care about or listen to.  

I know it can be difficult, especially when those things come from family members or authority figures, but eventually you will be surrounded only by the people who love and support you.

I think it’s just something you’ll need to expect, especially come to things like buying alcohol when you are of age.

I saw some other comments that said he left and got a gun, but he’d already had it in his backpack for “self-defense.” Not defending this kid because what he did was very wrong and is traumatic to the people at the school, but that’s just what the news said. 🤷🏽‍♀️",2021-10-07 03:32:12

And he was like “eww no the joke was ‘a great burglar’”. I didn’t even know what what I said meant. 😭,2020-07-09 04:35:18

Some guards can use fire extinguishers to handle smaller fires, but if they feel that the potential danger is too high, they are under no obligation to risk their safety or the safety of others. And even in that case, their job is still to tell their command center first so that someone else knows what's happening and can act on it.

* Billing families of executed prisoners for the cost of the bullet (/u/8-D) [Source]

* execution vans (/u/fudge_friend) For anyone who also didn't know what it was:

The prisoner is strapped to a stretcher and executed inside the van. The van allows death sentences to be carried out without moving the prisoner to an execution ground. The vans also require less manpower per execution, requiring four persons to assist with the injection and are mobile. [...] There is concern that mobile execution units have made organ harvesting much easier and more profitable, as lethal injection does not damage the body.""

Please remember this isn't xenophobia or racism or a direct issue with the Chinese people but an issue with their autocratic leader and his government. As well as western companies support of that and their attacks on their own customers I.e. ***us.***

Please add your own examples ...if you've fact checked it and fact check these too. Facts still matter!

And If you want to know why all this matters you can Google China's involvement in ethnic cleansing, execution vans, concentration camps, child prostitution, organ harvesting, western IP theft, citizen brain washing and much more.

And remember this is an issue with the Chinese government and not the wonderful people and history of China and it's contribution to the world. This isnt xenophobia. This is about it's autocrat dictator god emperor for life Ji Xingping and his evil corrupt rule.

dfvs6y,"That is what they want you to think. “This is just the way things are, and I can’t really change anything.”

In reality, people can change anything. We made this world. Sure, you can’t majorly influence it alone; but you’re not alone. You’re one of seven billion nodes, and whether your switch is flipped to “apathy” or “fight for what is right” means everything. 

Your stance effects others, you pass on your apathy or your empathy every day.

We'd be hanging out at lunch in a circle, chatting, and I'd realize that I couldn't remember half their names despite hanging out at school for the past few months. Then, I'd self-consciously avoid revealing this fact while desperately hoping the name or names would be used by others.

like this person maybe couldn't get pregnant for two years and then said ""fuck it time to go back to school"", didn't think they'd be able to, continued not using contraception because either what's the point OR it's fine, we'll figure it out as we go along... and then BAM you're halfway through a degree giving birth 🤷🏼‍♀️ lol

I knew a girl who went to my school who was on baby #4 by 11 or 12th grade from a dude that constantly cheated on her. That type of thing is normal here even with sex ed and planned parenthood.

no one would show up to eat until the food was cold & nasty, they'd all refuse to eat it, then they'd complain about how hungry they are 3 hours later and irritate the fucking piss out of me. the kids would stop growing and the pediatrician would call CPS on me for neglect.",2021-02-26 02:03:16

fj115m,"First of all, appreciate that moment. You have a moment you’ll be thinking about for a very long time. Few moments are like that, and that’s cool no matter what happens next.

Second, keep doing what you’re doing cause it’s working!

Finally, when the moment is right ask her out to something you want to do and you think she would have fun with, too. That way you’ll enjoy yourself which helps makes other people relax and enjoy themselves. Also if all goes to shit then at least you did something you’ve wanted to do  so not a total loss. Lastly on this one, the moment will come where you’re chatting and you bring up something you’ve been wanting to do and she seems interested (maybe by asking about it or saying that sounds cool), so all you have to do is ask if she wants to join you.

I learned way too late that I made things a lot harder than they were and if I would have just appreciated the moment, kept doing what was working, and shared the things I enjoyed with others than things would have worked out. I hope you make different mistakes from me. 🙂

fggne5,"Please, stay with her. When they give her the first medication to sedate her/put her unconscious, please don’t leave. I worked as a vet assistant for a while, and it always broke my heart when the owner wouldn’t stay for the final injection and for us to confirm that they had, indeed, passed away. I can’t tell you how many pets I’ve hugged and held because I didn’t want them to be alone in their last moments. (I understand that it can be hard, and I also understand that the pet is not conscious). 

I’m so sorry that you’re having to say goodbye to your girl :(

Edit: read some comments and saw that you won’t be able to be with her because of school. Just ask that whoever takes her stays with her ❤️",2020-03-11 01:13:59

h9ir2e,"answering some questions that a lot of people have been asking:
- honestly don’t know how long this took (a really long time is my best estimate); painting process was as follows. as a rising ninth grader i looked up starry night and the great wave and was like damn wouldn’t that be cool on my bedroom wall, so i painted my wall blue, dicked around for a few months, sketched it in chalk, dicked around for a few more months, then painted the majority of it last august and this spring. i’m a rising junior now btw

- i used cheap liquitex acrylic paint and a clearance bulk pack of brushes from michaels

- i’m 5’1 i used a ladder

- this is my most recent and best painting hence why i posted it, i’m not proud of my other shit lol. i also don’t have many pieces in general this is like my fourth acrylic piece lol 

- i posted this on r/art so i could get enough karma to post on here, genuinely didn’t expect both to blow up. thank you so much for the kind words and awards

- i’m 15 i don’t have a website and i’ve never done prints. i’m honestly speechless at the fact people wanna pay money for this ;-; that’s so cool guys. just google starry night and great wave and you’ll find thousands just like the painting

- yes you can have a cookie 🍪",2020-06-15 20:52:23

mza4ai,"You've got 2k+ comments of praise and if you don't see this kid that's fine, but I'm proud of you. I'm in my late twenties and dealt with it as a kid and later in sports aka ""hazing"", but it only has made me an angry person. Even a couple of years ago when I was harassed by a lady at work it took other co-workers to step in. She told me once (after the millionth time of her being awful to me) ""what would you do if I kicked you in the nuts"" I said some awful things to her (won't say what I said...) and realized it's a problem to let ppl mistreat you. No matter your age or size you **need** to stand your ground and that's exactly what you did. 

You're gonna look back at yourself in your older years with pride and fondness knowing you did the right thing. I also appreciate your father for being supportive. I am so proud of you 🙂.",2021-04-27 07:37:59

I stopped touching my face during the day and washed my face in the morning and night. Dries me out but have a scentless lotion to moisturize with if needed.

l7c51j,"You try simple hygiene before considering pharmacological treatments and you keep doing it while you’re on acne drugs, not after once the drug has failed 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️

You can’t make blanket statements like that. There’s a reason Accutane is reserved for the most severe types of acne, and you are right that like many drugs it has some major side effects.

However this is a decision that should be taken after a discussion with your doctor, not some random person on the internet.

Acne, especially cystic acne, has severe psychological effects, and has a huge impact on your ability to socialize and your self confidence. It’s one of the leading causes of mental distress in teenagers. There are many types of acne, and each type has its own set of guidelines on the best course of treatment. These guidelines are made after a careful analysis the risks and benefits using all available data by experts. Accutane is never a first-line treatment, at least not where I live.

Every single prescription drug has had at least one person die because of it. Stating rare side effects as if they are going to happen to anyone taking the drug is ridiculous. Some of the things you have stated are not only unproven, but even disproven. There’s a reason drugs require a prescription. 

With appropriate care and follow-up, and when prescribed responsibly, Accutane is a good option when topical and antibiotic treaments, combined with good hygiene, fail to suppress severe cystic acne. It’s severe side effects are always weighed against the severity of the acne and its impact on the patient’s wellness before initiation of the treatment.

Please stop giving medical advice online, you clearly aren’t a medical professional. If you get caught you could get sued for giving medical advice without a licence.",2021-01-29 06:24:13

elqvhw,My parents about my music taste😂,2020-01-08 16:42:44
elqvhw,"Dude you don’t even know... The entire maternal side of my family only cares about two things: if you’re a good farmer or if you’re good at sports/theatre (none of which apply to me) and that’s what they judge each other based on...

They constantly just sit around and trash talk other people that aren’t in the room with them & it’s fucking disgusting. They don’t just trash talk, it’s more like a full on roast. They target a specific person & just act like it’s one of those consentual roasts where ur entire family is just there to roast you on tv, only it’s not consentual and the person doesn’t even realize it’s happening.

My siblings started picking up on this toxic behavior & they trash talk me when they think I’m not listening. I’m afraid of someday having my future kids spend time around my family and having them pick up on this behavior as well. Worst part is,  my current bf is trilingual, so if he ends up being the father of my future kids, they could easily trash talk people in another language so they can’t understand, just like those Mexicans in high school that always got scolded for whispering to each other in spanish (don’t act like you don’t know what I’m talking about). They could even trash talk me & I wouldn’t know unless my bf was in the room translating what they are saying.

Also holy shit, I met my cousin’s new gf this Christmas and I’ve never met someone more aggressively judgemental in my life... TL:DR for down below: My cousin’s new crazy psycho girlfriend’s first interaction with me at Christmas made her come off as a crazy psycho bookworm ready to judge the fuck out of me if I didn’t show at least some interest in books. I panicked to make a good first impression and burned myself out trying to come up with an excuse for why I never read any of the Harry Potter books which she seemed strongly offended by.

At Christmas, my cousin’s new gf literally just plops herself down in the chair across the table from me & immedietely is like “so...what kind of books do you read?”. Being the shy gamer girl non bookworm that I was, I was like “Uhh...I like...reading...books that get movies made off of them? Because I uh...I like to see the difference! 😅”. This was honestly my best shot because most books that I have read were made into movies within the last 5 years or so, but then she asks “So like Harry Potter?”. “Shit. She got me, I thought”. Then I nervously say to this intimidating alpha female “Oh I uh...I’ve seen all the movies, but never...read the...books...”. “Why not!?” she said in a mildly raged/disappointed tone. “Well I just, I never really had access to them when I was young...” I said. “YOUR PARENTS WOULDN’T LET YOU READ THEM!?” she said shocked. What I meant by “didn’t have access to them” was that I didn’t find the books lying around in my house, I was never offered the book by anyone, nobody ever came to me and said “oh you should read this book, I’ll get it for you”. I would’ve had to actively seek out the books on my own which just wasn’t a thing a gen z zoomer like me would be interested in.

This crazy bookworm lady just put so much pressure on me and made me feel bad for not being what she expected me to be like. Somebody really should’ve informed her I have autism... I honestly should’ve just told her in a condescending tone: “Listen honey...I come from a completely different generation from you...we don’t read books anymore. We play videogames and use social media. There’s not rly room in our lives for...books”. Ugh I should’ve baited her into saying sth I could reply to with “Ok Boomer”. That would’ve rly made my day honestly XD",2020-01-09 03:51:12

eyauas,Thank you for reminding me about one time when me and a friend of mine literally went mattress surfing on old twin mattresses we found up against a dumpster and rode them about a mile down the river 😂😂😂,2020-02-04 00:18:24
eyauas,Lmao 😂,2020-02-03 23:43:34

eyauas,i have a job tho i’m just poor white trash who can barely put food in my own mouth 🤔🤔 wbu? do you work your ass off every day so your money can get stolen for the light bill and drugs?,2020-02-04 00:22:47
eyauas,"i do put it towards food you dipshit that’s why i steal every once in a while because not everyone can run to mommy and ask for this cool new hat. like i said me and my family are broke white trash everybody’s on drugs nobody works hardly and i’ve had a really fucked up life. sure i wish i was rich and could pay for everything i own and could get myself out of this hellhole of a place but yeah not how it goes in this world. foodstamps and welfare only go so fucking far. don’t lecture me you yuppie rich kid riding the gravy train

edit: yeah, i’m gonna cough up a few hundred bucks to pay the bills because otherwise i’d be sleeping in the cold. i’ll support my family’s fucked up habits, for one, because they are my guardians and give me this shelter, and also out of pure necessity.

i also have my own fucked up habits to support as you can imagine lol

it runs in the blood 🤷‍♂️ you wouldn’t understand",2020-02-04 00:28:53
eyauas,"how u gon criticize someone else’s lifestyle when u can’t even use the right your/you’re 😂😂

relax softie who cares if he steals a couple of food items when he’s living in poverty. yous acting like this mans is singlehandedly destroying the whole food industry 😂 he’s not a bad person just cause of some petty theft, he’s still trynna take care of his fam even tho they’re the ones that put him in a tough lifestyle so respect him for that",2020-02-24 13:36:17
eyauas,"Lol ok so I deserve to die. That’s cool. Fuck you. Just you try and shoot me. See what happens, boy.

EDIT: I don’t go around robbing folks. I occasionally engage in petty theft from billion dollar corporations. I have morals, principles, respect for people. If you believe I deserve the fucking *death penalty* for that, then I don’t know what to tell you except that you’re by far a worse man than I am. I’m no victim. Just doing what I can to survive. And I by no means can strike out on my own right now. So, yeah, I’m gonna block you now and if you have any more death threats to make just know that I do have firearms and my address isn’t that hard to find out 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️",2020-02-04 13:46:44
eyauas,"i posted a more detailed explanation down below. basically that’s all there is to do around here 🤷‍♂️ i’d love to have an in-depth, sit-down conversation with you irl over a little pot lmao and explain to you all the little nuances and history of this trailer trash lifestyle but hey there’s no way and y’all can’t possibly understand from a half baked internet convo

> if you lived like i did in a dirty old beat up trailer home with violence and crime and fucked up shit and abuse going on all the time with tweakers moving in and out and not being able to get any fucking sleep yeah you’d be walking around drinking on a beer puffing on a cigarette stoned as a motherfucker too buddy

>day in and day out, no hope, no change, just poverty, hellraising and violence roy",2020-02-04 00:56:15

db9ly6,"""M-m... M""

No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.

""M-m-mine...""

However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.

""M-m-m-minecraft...""

Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.

""Minecraft...""

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

0.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad Instagram normie Emojis bad Keanu breathtaking Wholesome 100 [Everyone liked that] Area 51 PETA bad 69 nice 420""

""AaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyyyYYYYYYYYYYYyaYayaYaASyAAaYaaYayaAAAaaUGgGHHhHHhhHHhhHHh😩😩👅👄👀🥵🥵mmmmMMMMmMmMMMMMMMMM😭🤯😱😂🤣😍🤪💦hhhhhhHhFFFfffF""

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore.  Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

▪the unadvertised purpose to increase patriotism and social harmony in New generations by highlighting national accomplishments, glossing over its mistakes, and emphasising community identity. 

▪the sometimes unintended consequence of fueling white nationalism by only highlighting accomplishments made by ethnic Europeans, and suggesting other's accomplishments were derivative of such. 

Of course, this is an American curriculum, I'm sure the white nationalism part is decidedly different in regions that weren't colonized and ethnically cleansed by European nations for generations.",2020-11-18 16:56:45

hfuo8q,"Thanks and I get tinnitus sometimes and yeah I mean it does suck I just have worse problems to focus on 😂😂 Thanks for the support. Also I’ve never met anyone with the same issues, everyone else compares it to swimmers ear even though I know it has nothing to do with that. (I have gotten swimmer’s ear once and it was hell, I had to get special drops cause the over the counter hurt like hell and make it worse). One interesting thing I’ve found is after trying to go under in clean, warm, bath water, I have not had pain. I did not let much enter but I’ve been dunk’d in cold pool water once when I wasn’t wearing earplugs and the normal painful results happened. When I had swimmers ear and got prescribed drops, the person there said it might help with discomfort to warm the drops up by putting the closed bottle in hot water before using because ears are normally at a warmer temperature than other parts of your body and can feel pain and discomfort from cold. So basically what I’m saying is oceans are the worst, ponds are second worst (I had an infection for a whole year after getting water stuck in my ear from a pond, it stayed so long cause I literally cry from anxiety at the topic of ear drops), pools are third, and warm baths are the best. Sorry I could have just said thanks but then I got to thinking 😂",2020-07-04 04:19:46

p2rk7d,"In fifth grade my elementary school did something similar. There were three different fifth grade classes in this particular school so the teachers divided it up as one class would have a republican candidate, another would pick the democratic one and a chick from mine played the role of the independent party.

Our classes had a day to plan our campaign and then the rest of the week was about putting up posters and telling other kids in the lower grades why “YOU should  vote for THIS PERSON”

Then on the next Friday we picked a group of kids to hand out and collect ballots as lower classes took turns being brought into our classroom to vote. Once that was done, the teachers announced the following Monday who won.

It was the “republican” candidate by a wide margin. What I noticed as one of the ballot collectors was the majority of kids just picked the one their parents were registered under. I knew this because it’s what they’d tell me 😂

ipf65g,"I’m not fat in fact I’m really skinny (5’8” and 120 lbs 16 yrs old) and have been my whole life. But I can give you some info I’ve learned and observations I’ve made about what people do who are much bigger than me. First is that I almost never drink any soda or juice. Soda and juice have seriously unhealthy amounts of sugar and has no fiber to help your body process it, unlike fruit that has similar sugar levels. This means that your body turns almost all of that sugar into fat rather than energy. I only drink soda 4 times a week at most if at all (usually only when I go out to eat at a restaurant). Soda wasn’t meant to be a beverage it was meant to be a treat and people should treat it as such. The biggest people I see are the ones who have replaced water with juice and soda.  Ofc don’t quit drinking soda and juice cold turkey. But instead maybe if you drink soda or juice everyday only allow your self to drink it every other day until you slowly work it out of your diet. Another thing is to eat slowly. I’m one of the slowest eaters I know but I do it mostly on purpose because 1: You get to enjoy your food (lol) and 2: It gives your brain time to process how much food you’ve eaten. You need to give your brain time to process what you eat as your eating it not after devouring a whole plate of food. Usually I pause half way through my meal and wait maybe five minutes before I continue eating slower than I did for the first half of the plate. Using this I almost never go back for seconds unless I was really hungry before dinner. There are a few other tips I would like to give but this comment is already like three novels long so if you want some more advice feel free to DM me. One last thing is that I’m not an expert or some kind of personal trainer this is just what I’ve observed and learned through my own personal experience. ✌️",2020-09-09 20:29:10

kf8ze5,"🚨🚨Soap and water will dry out your face too much,  but don't use lotion on your face neither!! Then you will tip the scale the opposite direction and your face will be greasy. Use a moisturizer specifically made for your face. Personally, I use baking soda mixed with apple cider vinegar to exfoliate (GENTLY), then mousturize with a small amount of coconut oil mixed with sugar and tea tree oil and wash off the excess with water, you can make bulk amounts of both of these really cheap and it seems to work well for me.",2020-12-18 13:50:06

cnqifq,"Listen here, you under mixed Tupperware of egg salad. Your strict parent is worried about a whole world of horrible shit that could happen to the tiny, screaming, turd yeeting, ungrateful, skin bag  they brought into this world who is utterly incapable of hearing good council. 

These people wiped your ass 5-10x a day for YEARS. 

They slept a couple hours a night for months on end, rocking you as you wailed and teethed. 

They themselves starving, they fed you first. 

Sweaty and exhausted, they bathed you. 

Frustrated from a long day at work, they helped you with home work. 

Wearing years old clothes, they take you school shopping. 

Embarrassed and disappointed, they defend you. 

Remember, EVERY parent was a teenager once. It turns out that some things change drastically, but really they stay the same; your parents’ young adulthood wasn’t so different as your own as far as personal/family dynamics go. Maybe, just maybe (read that as guaran-fuckin-tee), they understand something you don’t. At the very least, they put up with a whole lot of shit from you over the years, now suffer in silence with theirs as you yearn for first tastes freedom.

Anyway, done being a bummer. I hope very soon we will all come together as the human race, and love each other and our planet. (I can dream right?)",2021-07-12 06:59:00

Now she never, ever turns when someone is coming with a signal light on or first at any crossroads.

kaclif,"Actually no I’m not, no WE’RE not. I, a bisexual girl, have experienced intense homophobia around me before even coming out and stayed strong.  People would call things gay in a rude way (this is kinda rude too) and if they suspected someone was gay, they’d threaten them, etc. Quite frankly I’m just being sure that people aren’t being homophobic assholes on here, and if they are, I’m gonna call them out in it. It already happens with people around our age in the real world when it was still open. Think before you act next time, because there ARE people who are feeling emotional and sensitive right now, who are struggling with their mental health,  and that could damage them. So don’t get mad at me because what you said was wrong and I’m calling you out for it. Also what WERE you implying when calling it gay? Because from what you said about the pledge, it sure as hell doesn’t sound good. 🤨",2020-12-10 14:01:06
kaclif,"🙄


No asshole, that’s not even funny. I already clarified to the person who wrote it that I was just making sure they weren’t being rude because that’s what some homophobic people generally do (not saying they are, and I understand it was a joke). Even the little things can make a person upset, especially if their mental health is really bad and and not everyone can tell what is a joke and what’s not.",2020-12-11 17:01:57

He was always getting in trouble for throwing things. I wouldn’t be surprised to hear he threw a chair at a bully. It sounded like him. So at this I’m like, are we talking about the same Jacob? Did he do that when he was in 4th grade? He was 1 year below us. We did have exchange students that year. Our class got a Brazilian boy but I don’t know about other grades.

Indentation instead of brackets is annoying.
Too simple in a lot of areas such as making functions, of statements, and for loops.
Also, isn't true and false capitalized? Blah🤮

Java is what I know best, then probably Python, as much as I hate to admit it (though it's been 6 months since I've really used it much). I learned a little C during Quarantine but the compiler is a hard one to please in that language.

hxy363,parents' fault imo... why do your kids have full access to the internet? might as well allow them to roam the streets on halloween night all by themselves 🤦,2020-07-26 14:17:20
hxy363,"I hated nothing more then the guys (16+) who made daddy Daughter POVs where the child (you) walks into their parents room while they're having sex 😭 that shit was so disgusting.

In saying that not all of tiktok is like that 'alt tiktok' is pretty cool everyone hated those POVs",2020-07-26 04:15:04
hxy363,just take their devices away at this point... a flip phone and a kindle for them 😐,2020-07-26 06:35:47
hxy363,"Tiktok is just the embodiment of bad content. On a side we have females who just shake their butts and use their sensual movements for free likes. On the other hand, in the app there are a bunch of ❄️ that can't take a single joke about their idols",2020-07-26 07:33:36
hxy363,It's banned in india. We successfully eliminated the virus🤭.,2020-07-26 08:28:23
hxy363,"Just to bring some facts to this post, Tik tok is split into many different sub-comunities, the 2 biggest ones being straight and alt tik tok in this post there should be confirmed that straight tik tok is clearly the problem since that it where men dance shirtless and grab their 🍆 for little children to see 

Alt tik tok is split into way more categories such as: witch, frog, cottagecore, dark, political etc... most of the posts on this side are made by members of the LGBTQ+ community for others in the community 

Hope this helps",2020-07-26 08:49:33
hxy363,"I thought like that of Tik tok as well in the beginning, cause I saw all the girls doing those dumb dances at my school. But through my little brother who used the app (not to make videos) I discovered that Tik tok actually has some good and fun content as well. Those stupid dances and whatnot are only one section of Tik tok. There are also many accounts who make funny or informational videos or just show make up tutorials and other stuff. The side most people are so pissed of about is called ""Straight Tik tok"" on the Plattform and is dispised by all the other sides of Tik tok as well (for example frog Tik tok, alt Tik tok, LGBTQ Tik tok, beanie Tik tok etc. for every interest there are Tik tok sites). Tik tok isn't all that bad, there's just a lot of dumb people who are using the app and you have to learn how to avoid them☺️",2020-07-26 09:21:25
hxy363,The thing I hate the most about Tik tok is that in Uk Tik tok their are videos of people clearly getting bullied and everyone in the comments is like “it’s character development” or “People who think this is bullying: ❄️”,2020-07-26 10:23:53
hxy363,Bruh this generation of kids is fucked. I saw a little girl about 10 I would say lick her hand and put it on her 😾,2020-07-26 10:54:01
hxy363,"I agree with what OP is saying, however Tik Tok always bans these type of things. I actually kinda use Tik Tok to show me information (and memes) as lots of people always post things like that.. I try my best not to get bad things by going on the Not Interested button so that anything like weird or inappropriate videos get blocked... But I recommend you take their phones for a year or two cause that is just disgusting behavior especially for something a 7 and 10 year old would do..😕😬",2020-07-26 13:21:55

hxy363,"One word: pedophilia. These inappropriate picks just say younger (under 18) TikTok users to do [xyz] or to show their private pieces. Then, become absolute turds/s## abusers/prostitutes. Guess what? It's their fault for being naive and stupid. Imitating some idiot they saw on a **Chinese** social media app with nothing better to do all day that sit around with a camera in his face recording a Coke bottle blow up after putting minty sweets in it, well that is another level. My own sister had TikTok for a while. Quoted her excuse: **bEcAuSe mY cOuSiN hAs iT, iT iS nOt fAiR sHe cAn dO eVeRyThInG**. Started imitating people on it. Forced her to delete it after 2 months. Praying for the app to be banned in the UK. If you want something to brainwash you to the point your IQ is on the level of a horse, look no further. If you have a milligram of common sense you would avoid the app like the plague. They will kill themselves for TikTok. Have a cookie 🍪 if you made it this far.",2020-07-28 16:32:57
hxy363,"When I was 8 I got my first iPad for Christmas, it was my relatives old iPad 1st gen. I was responsible with it tho but I think age should not be a factor, you should be thinking about how responsible you think they would be online.

hxy363,"I didn't get my cellphone until I was 12, and it was a little basic thing for emergency calls because I wanted to start walking myself home from school. I remember being a little jealous of the kids in class who had smartphones, but I was too busy with my nose in a book or playing outside to care about wanting one. Even now I spend way too much time using my phone and I'm halfway considering going to a flip phone.

Thanks for coming to my Boomer™ TED Talk",2020-07-26 04:59:36
hxy363,"I beg to differ. Im currently 21, m, and a few years back in highschool, my buddy and i, both 15 and 16 at the time caught wind from youtube about the dark web, and how easy it was to download the Tor browser. We skimmed through the hidden wiki as a refrence point, simply looking at the items availible on these illigal websites (obviously being 15, 16 at the time, their was no intention to actually purchase), such as silk road when it was still a thing. We came across a website named ""pink meth"", thinking nothing more of it then another sketchy drug website to look at. It took 1 click for me to completly uninstal Tor, turn my pc off completly, and contact my mother saying something like ""if the fbi come and arrest me, know i love you"" yada yada. It is way, way too easy to unintentionally come across it. As sickening as it may be, it is a very real problem on the dark web

My cancer stole my confidence, but returned to me my hope,
It filled my mind with fear, that let me hear my heart again
It gave my people such sorrow, which raised their joyous thoughts of me
Yes my cancer has taken much, but it's given me better things to see.

i4h53e,"You can get a motorcycle with 16 too but is only has 125 km/h (not a lot) and over 50 PS is the maximum PS (PS= Pferdestärken= Horse power) the motorcycle can drive. There's once the ""small"" motorcycle license which goes to up to 50 PS. You can drive any motorcycle which is limited to 50 PS or less. You can also drive one that CAN drive more but then it has to be throttled down to 50 PS. 
Then there is the ""big"" license too. With that one you can drive any motorcycle you want (except a R1 for example because that's a racing motorcycle which needs a special license for driving on highways and stuff like that) . The earliest age you start a car license is 16 ½ but you can't take the exam to pass your theory lessons. So the best thing is to wait until you're 17 then do your license and do ""begleitendes Fahren"" which means you can drive the car as long as someone with a driver's license sits on the passenger seat and could take the wheel anytime. And once you passed your license exam you can't drink something for 2 years if you want to drive home. If you get pulled over and tested for alcohol and even if you're not above the appropriate Alcohol level, you can get your license taken away, have to take a new test and go into drivers rehab.... and that's on Germany's driving rules 😂 traffic is a whole other thing 😂😅",2020-08-06 10:41:47

However, if you get caught 2 times over that alcohol level, you get the same punishment like you'd get within these two years. What can I say: We Germans love alcohol 😂😅",2020-08-06 14:11:11

Don’t reply tomorrow forget about your research. Because i can’t have a convo with you without swearing. Poor baby, can’t you make a point without swearing? So yet again, because somebody can’t communicate propperly.  Makes me think you got the 2 brain cells...

i wish you the best of luck with yourself and finding inner peace !   🍀",2021-06-28 20:12:27
o9j975,"No, you don’t understand me. 

Again: i have NOTHING against Transgenders, i live in Amsterdam.  Weekly i see atleast 1 transgenders walking around.  What they want to do in the bedroom it’s really their business.  I only complain about the part that they want to be accepted but can’t accept themselves first... 

It was not suppose to be an insult, obviously people got triggered. Like always on the internet, i didn’t felt like reacting on the comments.  But would want to explain myself for the curious ones among us.  I’m not an expert or know alot about transgenders. I just find it annoying hearing them complain. 

Like all this sadness in this world, middle-eastern countries getting terrorised by Americans/israeli troops and some European countries.   Palestina-Israel conflict, childsoldiers in Africa.  Dying people in Africa because they still are starving to death, with food or clean water.  Uyghurs in China that get used like labratory rats. Exactly what the Germans did in WO 2 with the Jews. By the way the Israeli do that too with muslim in Palestine.  There is so much bad things going on , but the gay-community - Transgenders get all the spotlight? 

If you ask me this world including it’s citizin is broken!  Everyone is to busy with me, myself and i.   Where is the “we” , why aren’t we standing up for the real weak people in some parts of the world?  Why is nobody doing shit against the Chinese because of what they do to the Uyghurs.  Why is nobody telling Israel to stop using Palestinekids as human shield, and to stop shooting Palestine ambulances trying to help the wounded/dead people after a huge airstrike.  That’s why i really don’t care a single byte about the Transgenders. If you have the luxury position to complain about gender. You have other things to be more worried about if you ask me.   Peace! 🍀",2021-06-28 17:49:01

o9j975,"No worries! I am willing to explore my own mind as well, it's not always sensible 😊

That line of thinking is purely conceptual, it doesn't have basis in reality as we biologically exist right now. 

We are, on the physical level, complex biological machines. Machines are made up of binary interactions. If this, then that. If that, then this. 

I see not black and white but only Grey, yet due to ""lines drawn in the sand of perception"" we have the binary of black and white continually exploring the gradient of Grey.",2021-06-28 16:12:01

o9j975,"I'm talking about in general. The only people that attack trans people are doing it to be edgy. The whole fucking point of the goddamn joke is to make fun of people who identify as actual objects. Thats the whole fucking point. The original video is the guy saying ""im just a __ with a rocket launcher"" after a video of multiple people saying like ""im gay, i identify as __"" and so on. The whole point isnt to make fun of trans people. It's to make fun of people who purposefully choose to identify as an object. And another point is just to meme the original video. I don't see how a single person can be offended by an ancient video that no one complained about when it was first released. Even now in meme videos, I've never seen a person who reacted to it actually complain. They laugh and move on. 

It's a fucking joke older than the mental ages of half of this subreddit's community.  

https://youtu.be/6xNPjCZKxGo

This is probably not the original, as it has few views compares to others. But please, find me a  single top comment that is actually offended by this. The comment section is just jokes. Like ""i identify as a burger"" or some shit. It's a fucking joke. If you can't handle a joke on Reddit then you're not on the right platform.

Reddit is full of overused jokes, shit memes, idiots, reposts, and edginess. Trying to police people like ""🤓 dont do that pls im actually gay and thats offensive"" is the same as a Mall cop trying to stop a bank robber because he finds it rude.",2021-06-28 15:59:32

Of course I wasn't gonna scream at a 5 year old, but I told my sister to put it up when she was done playing with it so the niece couldn't get to it.

Cue to years later. I'm talking to now 15 year old niece on the phone and my DS comes up. I just gave her one my old 3DS. Long story short she says ""what? I was never allowed to play with your DS. I never touched it."" My lying clumsy twin. 😒",2021-07-14 23:38:16

gogm4o,"Dear Redditor neighbor,
I'm from Macau, next to Hong Kong, which is also an Special Administrative Region, and usually known as the well behaved one. We've had this law since 2009, and while protests and public demonstrations against the government are discouraged, there is still freedom of internet, and your freedoms won't be affected if you have always kept your opinions to your friends and aren't a huge hassle maker. I'm pro HK, and look here I am. The hk security law is more of a fear weapon, and *the worst thing you can do right now is to give them the pleasure of you looking scared.*

And now, if in HK the police will abuse the law, that's another subject that should be heavily boycotted and fought against. But don't think of this as the end of HK. It's a limitation and it's wrong, but not the end. Stay strong  ✊",2020-05-22 14:57:39

9wh8k5,R.i.P Stan Lee..your work will live on for decades to come❤🙏,2018-11-12 21:34:05
9wh8k5,"Kinda off topic but I still wanna mention this

He made characters that made such huge contributions in my life. Spider-Man, a guy who so many kids and even adults can relate to. Kinda literally saved my life, when I was in my dark moments I turned to comic books, Spidey was just a kid like most of us who just wanted to be accepted. He was bullied, had romantic problems and was generally an outcast like a lot of the people in the world. 

Despite him getting superpowers he never once got revenge on his tormentors. Instead he was out saving the world, he taught a lot of us important values. Because of Spider-Man and indirectly Stan Lee, I feel like I became a better person and got of my depressive state. 

I’m not a 100% sure if he created Deadpool, but if he did. I also would like to Stan for creating my favorite character ever. I turned to Spidey and Pool during my dark times and both of them made me laugh so much. 



Stan had a profound impact on my life and I have never even met him. I speak for a lot of people when I say they’ll agree with me. 


RIP Stan Lee, a true legend, beloved by many, who’s legacy and work will live on for years ❤️",2018-11-13 00:02:33

hvlh52,"It could be worse. My date to junior prom did talk to me to the point that it was annoying. I liked her a LOT but somehow even that wasn’t enough to break through my introversion.

I did talk to her though, and she called me daily. We got comfortable with each other and through a mutual friend we knew we liked each other. We said we’d talk about it when we met up.

But then it all went south and I told her some things she wasn’t ready to hear, despite her pressuring me to. She friend zoned me after I told her, but I know she wasn’t telling me the whole truth, maybe she was even straight up lying. I begged her to tell me why she was doing this and all she would tell me was “I can’t be completely selfless with this”. We tried to be friends and make it normal but she ghosted me without warning. 

If your date hasn’t talked to you she doesn’t know what she’s missing out on. Keep that crown up high king (Queen?) 👑",2020-07-22 06:53:58

jekodw,"I mean they offer help but it’s not ever good. They basically just say, “lmao depressed people are bad. If you’re depressed talk to one of us idfk. Ok cya 👋🏻” and offer no help to anyone who is depressed",2020-10-20 12:32:28
jekodw,"Ok, so, I’m not saying that schools don’t play a role in the mental health of their students, but it takes two to tango. Schools DO teach time management- after 12 years of school, you should more or less know how to have a routine and complete most of your tasks. You should be able to know which assignments to prioritize for which days and how much time, roughly, it’d take you for each assignment. Ngl, I used this to my disadvantage cuz I literally just used this to procrastinate more rather than just get my work done earlier, but it’s still possible. The only difference college/ the “real world” has over high/middle school is that you get to pick ur own schedule, but even that won’t last long. I’m not saying school isn’t tough, and that the faculty are oh so very helpful and considerate, cuz for the most to part, they aren’t. That being said, when you’re in school, all you have to do is schoolwork. Unless you have to work ridiculous part time hours that make it a living hell to do your school work in time, there really isn’t a good argument as to why your schoolwork shouldn’t be done in time. It’s stressful, and I won’t deny schools do give students more work than they should have to deal with at home, but it’ll honestly just better prepare you for all of the bs you’ll have to deal with as an adult. 
My point is, your own mental health does play a role in this. In this case, it’s the cycle of how your mental health affects your school work affects your mental health... This time is important for you to try to learn how you learn, how you view life, how you deal with things that stress you out and the things you can do to work on the things that you feel like you can’t control. If I’m being honest with you, I think high school drama plays a bigger role in worsening your mental health than the actual school work. Again, I’m not minimizing how much work the schools actually put on you, but in my experience and that of my peers, my classmates made school more of a living hell than the actual school itself. In college, everyone’s on their own and no one really gives a shit about you. You still have your assholes here & there, but you’re much more independent. School’s tough, but it’s important to take responsibility for your actions and your bad habits. There is a lot that needs to be changed in our public school system, but it is important that you all don’t get into the habit of just thinking that the outside world is what affects your mental health and that that’s that. Change requires action, no matter how painful or hopeless it may seem. 
While there are a few things you could do as students to improve your own schools (and it IS important to recognize and vocalize these things, as you all are doing), and maybe even your local school systems if you advocate for yourselves and make your voices heard, but the best thing you can do for yourselves now is to try to take care of yourselves, both mentally and physically, as best as you can until you get out of that hellhole...
That was a lot, I know, sorry...😅",2020-10-20 14:23:55

lohws7," The food is kept In a heated area, so mcgriddles are like the one thing that's fine. After a while we actually just toss all breakfast stuff and make it to order.

In other news, if you're the kinda guy to order 12 sausage egg and cheese griddles at dinner rush, fuck you. If not, carry on. I didn't mind making one or two.

We closed all day breakfast at ours for some reason, not that it affects me much because I open. Can't say how breakfast affected the dinner people tho. A year ago when I had to do it it was annoying. Yes, I'm the one who was forced to make the mcgriddles

In other, other news, after noon, a lot of the breakfast crap was just nuked. Even some stuff was always nuked in the morning... Hotcakes? Nuked. Mcgriddles? Nuked.... Burritos? Made the previous day and nukes 5 minutes ago.

In other, other, other news. Ive spent the entirety of 8 hour shifts cleaning. The health inspectors we have are so freaking strict. In reality, fast food places are held to high standards by health workers, high end restaurants take so much pride in presentation that they WILL clean everything. It's those places in the middle ya gotta watch out for.

Big brk w/ hk isnt bad simply because q and toast is separate from grill. No difference for grill team, super easy for toaster cuz u just plop 3 hotcakes on a thing then toss it in one of the ✨ Qing ovens ✨ (microwave) and press 331 in that order (numbers are for mine, yours may have been different)

qki6yp,"Hey mate, I'm 25 as well, and just came out of the biggest depressive era of my life (basically feeling what you just described but from like 15 to 25 lol) but I want to tell you to keep holding on.  Seriously mate.  I truly know nothing about you except that we are the same age, but you will see peace, happiness and joy again like you have before.

I'm not always happy, and anyone who claims to be is a liar.  But I'm always not always soul-crushingly sad, and that's a win in my book.

If you need anyone to talk to, particularly someone with childhood trauma / lifelong unrecognized disabilities on a path to recovery, my Inbox is always open and you're welcome to say hi at any time 👋😊",2021-11-01 21:56:46

gdro1x,"High school teacher here. I approve. Just keep in mind that a lot of teachers are going into this with no training/prior instruction.

I’ve been breaking projects up into pieces and assigning something once a week. One student told me they have given up and it’s too much work (but he was failing prior to this). I asked another student if they think this is true, and they totally disagreed. It’s hard for us to find a balance sometimes. 

Just keep in mind that you can always leave constructive feedback to your teachers and let them know you’re feeling overwhelmed. We’re not zombies, we’re learning how to handle this shit at the same time you are. 🤷🏻‍♀️",2020-05-06 04:26:17

ciu93i,"So what your saying is babies should be killed just so they wont Maybe go into adoption and maybe have a shit life?? Honestly why does their environment growing up should determine their own life? How do you know what they are going to turn out like? The point of life to me is to grow and learn from your life experiences, whether it's good or bad. And make that into your own way of thinking, and make your own life in general. And that's also why you can get so much help out there. Bad experiences don't define people. I mean if you knew all of the bad experiences your children would go through when you were pregnant, would you get an abortion just for that? I don't know maybe I didn't word it correctly, but I feel like even if you were abused, raped, depressed, there is always help out there and you can get through it. People just give up to easily and don't realize how much of a good impact they can make upon the world. I mean think about all of the people you love right now. For all you know they could've had a bad childhood or have been abused in some way. My parents had awful childhoods filled with drugs, abuse, and more they probably would never tell me about. I don't even know that abused person, I know strong people who worked hard to get to where they are today. I get your view but this is just what I think about it 🤷‍♀️",2019-07-29 04:13:08

to keep pressing when the person states they’re a minor and is clearly not interested even if they weren’t a minor that’s just annoying and disrespectful

(edit: clarifying that wanting a casual hookup amongst adults is fine but even in that situation it’s still a bit of a red flag if the person literally is a stranger and hasn’t gotten to know you at all… if someone is requesting certain things and completely skipping getting to know you they don’t care about you they just care about what you can offer them which is lame and draining)",2021-12-21 01:01:30

So for me that was frustrating bc i had to do homework and didn’t understand anything so i would just send my friends text to take a pic of their homework lmao and that was not good cause that was my last year of primary school, so rn I’m in high school and the professors are explaining everything again...... online school was useless 😑 and all the hours of pain too...( btw i had all 5 - A - in school before so yeah) ( in Europe we don’t have letters for grades we have # , i think only in Germany they count their grades backwards so
1 = A
2 = B etc. but in other countries i think it is “ the right way “ so
5 = A
4 = B  etc. )",2020-10-06 17:35:31

lccp5h,"My favorite was being in a college creative writing class. We had to write a for and against paper, basically take a subject and argue for why it’s true and why it’s false with multiple sources. 

Well instantly the professor says “I don’t want to hear about abortion or marijuana I’ve heard it too many times”. Alright that’s pretty lame but it’s your class. So we have to present our ideas to them a week or two before we present. Well being a little crazy and tired of the same old boring for or against papers (apparently they were too) I was going to do “are there aliens on the moon”

Before you go “oh that’s stupid there is no way you could do that”, I had newspaper articles, websites AND documentaries for and against this. Every base covered

Well they decide it’s “not relevant enough”.....I get what they’re trying to say but basically everyone in the class did cigarettes and we spent the rest of the year watching bullshit with Penn and Teller. How creative.

ox3bo4,"How do you know your friends don't care?

I am not sure what your friend group is like, but in my life friends usually don't know when my birthday is and is not a big deal. When I turned 19 this year my friends found out the day of and just wished me a happy birthday, and that was the end of it. It is just how most people I know are. I have reached the point in my life where birthdays are really just another day and don't care at all about it. Just curious. I can imagine this is the dynamic for a lot of people.

Happy birthday though! 19 is a cool age and number for me! I will gift you a gold as a present from one stranger to another! ❤",2021-08-03 16:38:21

bo8o3m,"Most of the time you can tell by context. As the other comment pointed out, it won't matter with most words, but some times those accents are very important and their omission makes things confusing. Even then, however, context helps. For instance, I'm sure you have seen the ""my potato has 47 anuses"" post, no? Well, no one would read ""mi papa tiene 47 anos"" and say ""I asked this dude about his father, why is he talking about the number of anuses of his potato 🤔?""",2019-05-14 03:57:05

dfhjot,"This used to be a comment of actual value, but since reddit is breaking 3rd party apps and denying my ability to get content from them, they don't get to have any content from me.

axf7kt,"Privacy from your parents as a child is so much more important than people realise. My parents are split up and not long ago now my mum took my phone off of me and read every single message I'd ever sent or received, went through every single app (thank God that nova launcher lets you hide certain apps) and got me in trouble with the school with some stuff she found on there from other people. This completely ruined our already rocky relationship and when I returned to my dad's house after the week there I just never went back.

axf7kt,That or he was milking my mom for money knowing I would get around his blocks 🤔,2019-03-05 21:32:47
axf7kt,"Hey dude, it’s not necessarily too difficult. 

(I’ve always had an iPhone and it also works on iPad, I’ve never tried on android so I wouldn’t know how it works there)

But basically if you know when your device is about to block, then maybe 1 minute before it does go to the app you want to stay on, double press the home button (go to app switcher view) and then leave it there for the phone to block. Wait until 1 minute after it’s blocked(while still in app switcher view), by then you would have seen the phone glitch out abit and the app you wanted to stay on would have gone black or white and glitched out and you can see the apps on your home screen has disappeared. Once this has happened. Tap back into the app you could keep and then you can carry on using it all night! 

Side notes: I’ve had some instances where out of no where it would kick me back to the home screen. And if you want to take a picture from within the app, you can’t, because it’s blocked. 

Also very important, make sure, under no circumstances can you click the home button, because then it will block your phone again and you’ll get thrown back to the home screen for the rest of the night. 

But anyway, I hope it works. Enjoy ❤️",2019-03-05 08:19:20

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand",2020-01-03 02:46:22

OP, I want to start by saying that I think you're very brave, and I agree that you must report this.

But I also must warn you of the potential consequences of this for personal reasons. I want to make sure you understand what could happen.

My freshman year, my best friend (male) was raped by his older soccer teammates. He had supplanted one of them as a starter on the varsity team, so as a ""joke"" after practice one day, they held him down and shoved a stick up his ass while he screamed.

He went home in tears and told his mother everything. Long story short, those kids were expelled and charges were filed against them. 

Even though the school took him seriously, his peers at school would not. News of the ordeal spread like wildfire throughout the school, and until he graduated years later, he was *constantly* harassed by other students.

Every single time he walked to class, random strangers would point at him, laugh, and loudly ask, ""ISNT THAT THE KID THAT WAS RAPED??"".

Every picture with him that his girlfriend would post to Facebook, random kids would comment ""didnt your boyfriend get raped?? 🤣🤣"". It literally became a school meme.

Constant, absolutely constant, harassment and mockery. It got to a point where even he had to start playing it off like it was a joke if he didn't want to get in a fight every single day.

I talked to him about it years later. He had almost killed himself multiple times over it and wishes he had immediately switched schools.

I am not trying to scare you, OP. I just don't want you to be shocked when there is backlash from your peers, because I can almost guarantee that there will be and it does not seem like anyone in this thread is preparing you for that.

I do not know the culture at your school. It could be very different from the one my friend went to. But most teenagers do not take male rape seriously *at all*.

The best advice I can give you is, if you are going to do this, and I do think you should, please please please have an exit plan and be prepared to change schools and start over.",2019-10-19 15:27:29

dk1vz3,"if they’re doing it at school (which I assume they are) it’s pretty easy to get tape of them assaulting you from the cameras. last year when I was getting bullied, I talked to the principal about the cameras and where they capture you clearest. I started to spend my time in those areas, and eventually got camera footage of the girls being assholes. good luck, I’ve been where you are right now and you deserve better. 🧡✨",2019-10-19 12:34:15

r0kw9d,My 10 year relationship was exactly like that. He was 17 and I was 16. And I would always give him shit for dating a minor for that split second I was 16 and he was 18. It was amazing to find someone whose birthday was so close to yours. April 28 to April 29. If he makes you happy then it is between y'all and no one else. My 10 year was the best thing that ever happened to me. Wishing you the best ❤,2021-11-23 22:02:13
r0kw9d,When I was in high school I was dating someone who was about 15 months younger than me. When I turned 18 he was still 16 for a bit longer. Everyone acted like I was cradle robbing or something. It was so ridiculous. Esp my friend who when she was 15/16 & dating scummy 21/22yos.

- Half it
- Add 7

Nope. 11 grade i wanna pass while having fun.

So i just dont do their homework.

How i judge: if a teacher gives homework that takes me more than 40 minutes to complete for a short period of time i send them a mail and i dont do it.

They usualy call the principal but she is always on my side😎

WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT

i know that your life might be sad and you spend your days downvoting r/fortnite posts, commenting “emoji bad”, “ahaha chungus”, “wholesome 300”

just letting you know that that shit isn’t funny

if i feel like this 😀

i might want to express it without writing <<exclamation of joy>> because 13 years ago people invented emoji to make writing easier, as you can’t tell someone’s voices intentions just by looking at their message. How can i know if someone is sarcastic? by looking at his emoji

so please stop with this shit, get some help. thank you.",2020-07-07 06:58:38

i5ruca,"If someone is important enough for you, work a bit harder at fostering the relationship if you guys move away or grow apart  because of new relationships perhaps. Everything needs a bit of work in life. Keep focused on what is good for you and work at it. Whether it’s a relationship, a goal, an aspiring career or just your sanity. Make the call, talk (clearly), and don’t be afraid to be honest. The best you’ll ever feel is when you’re honest with yourself ❤️",2020-08-08 12:02:45

o0t1cf,"TW: ⚠️talk about suicide⚠️We had a kid kill himself in the bathroom of our junior high when I was in my freshman year and the school just gave the Junior High kids a day off and ignored that it happened, that same year a kid who went to the High School killed himself at home, same thing, school ignored it and gave everyone a day off, AGAIN same year, the vice principal was arrested for not just owning child p#rn and selling it to other people in our area, but also for pretending to be a child and text people in order to get n#des from kids at the Junior High and High school, What did the school do? They pretended it didn’t happen and gave us a day off. Why do they always pretend it doesn’t happen you ask? Because this is an EXTREMELY sporty town and our school only cares about sports, so they not just push aside and treat kids who aren’t sporty like dirt, but also will literally do ANYTHING to keep their sports reputation. As an example of just how sporty they are, when you first walk in to the Junior High AND High School, they have the walls lined with trophies and different sports stuff, nothing about the art trophies or music trophies those classes earned, no, those are kept in the art and band room

Oh and guess what, if you wear a hoodie you get expelled for 3 days, if you wear a hat they take it and expel you for 3 days, I wore a hat that LITERALLY just said “parental advisory, explicit content” just a parental advisory sticker on it THAT’S IT, no actually swearing or anything JUST the sticker, and I got it taken and was expelled for a week, my mom came up and they wouldn’t even let her get the hat back at first, she had to start yelling before they finally realized it’s less work to just give it back. And on top of that, it’s a a sporty town, well I am a overweight gamer with dyed hair who wear baggy clothes and has extreme acne.. guess why I’m always treated worse than everyone else? And most will think this is all exaggerated, I wish it was, this is ALL true, I am an outcast, most the kids hate me, all the teachers do hate me, and everyone else just doesn’t know me or doesn’t wanna talk to me. And the only reason dyed hair and piercings are allowed here btw, is because we have a bunch of “emo girls” that wear all black, with dyed hair and stuff, but they’re always happy, they’re all really popular and rich, and are the 14 year old girls who listen to Billie Eilish and say “I’m so depressed, look at me I’m quirky and sad”",2021-06-17 12:41:17

o0t1cf,"[LGBT teen face higher suicide risk](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2018/03/numbers) than cishet people. This is because LGBT people are oppressed, straight people aren’t. There are no documented cases of straight people dying because of their sexual orientation, of being bullied because of their sexual orientation, or being raped, or being forced to go to conversion therapy, or being thrown out of their house because of their sexual orientation. More than 90% of the world is straight, the big majority of people thinks that being straight is the “default”. How the fuck can you say that heterophobia is a real thing lmao. I honestly refuse to believe there were cases of heterophobia in your school, since i’m pretty sure that the majority of the kids in your school are straight themselves.

(I really wanted to say “Yeah, you do.” But I didn’t) I then asked her “How am I bullying anyone?!?” in a more assertive tone.
This bitch, this fucking bitch laughs and swims away as if she didn’t start this whole thing herself. My brother later told me that she was his substituter teacher once in high school. And that when kids were being kids and talking in class, she fucking left!!!  🤣

i5bs31,"OOOH MY GOD it's 6am and I legit just woke up from a dream where I replayed the memory of my ex saying this!!!

Y'all I swear, it's not enough that Google follows my every thought, now Reddit?! 😂

And let me give you context. I'm 28, not a teenager. When I was 24 I was dating this absolute fucking doorknob. I mentioned something about admiring a celebrity at some point near the end of our relationship. I can't remember who.... Someone who was roughly 6 months younger than both he and I. He full on cringed at me for saying I admired someone younger than me. I launched into a full tirade about how he's getting to the age where many people younger than us are doing extraordinary things and he was going to have to get the fuck over that prejudice. It didn't help that he was a layabout do-nothing loser, and I knew he was the type who looks forward to growing up and gaining the ""respect"" that comes from old age because there's not a chance he was gaining it through actual effort.

To be fair, we lived in a community that was demographically 95% Hispanics (as in first generation Americans or fully Mexican citizens who happened to live in America) and that culture is THICK with the ""respect your elders"" attitude. I will respect anyone until given a reason not to, but 9 times out of 10 if someone expects respect for nothing more than being OLDER than me that person is a steaming bag of shit.",2020-08-07 17:59:48

i5bs31,"Hijacking a top comment to say: I'm a teacher (excuse me for commenting in here 😅), and you guys are absolutely correct here. The fact that I've happened to keep myself alive longer than you doesn't make me inherently deserving of more respect than any of you, and it doesn't make me any wiser or smarter either. Every year that a person is alive is an *opportunity* to become more wise, but unfortunately I've met 85 year-olds who haven't learned jack shit in their entire existence on this planet. 

In short, you're not crazy; age truly is just the amount of time you've managed not to die, and that doesn't really deserve any special respect. Respect is earned.

edit: I should also of course add that OPs story is describing an outlandishly unprofessional teacher who ~~probably~~ definitely has no business being a teacher

edit2: I want to make a distinction with the word ""respect."" Common decency and dignity isn't earned; you ought to be giving that to everyone around you, even if they kind of suck. But special respect, as in looking up to someone and granting them *extra* respect and veneration? There is not a single human being on Earth who is entitled to that. That is 100% earned.

i5bs31,"I'm with you 100%. As it regards OP's specific story, I'll say that his response was definitely inadvisable haha but certainly justified! 

Regarding the teacher/student relationship, I definitely also agree that there's a situationally specific respect there that isn't related to age. As a 25 year-old teacher, I deserve the same degree of respect as a 50 year-old teacher. 

However, that situationally specific respect does go both ways. I'm going to respect my students in a way that is elevated above the respect I'd give to just any random teenager on the street. They're my students; I have an elevated responsibility to them. And ideally, that would be reciprocated in the form of them respecting me in a way elevated above what they would give to just any random adult on the street (although we all know it doesn't always work out like that 😂).",2020-08-07 16:31:52

enc2ma,"Disclaimer: I agree wholeheartedly with your statement🤗

According to English dialect, both written and verbal, your phrasing and syntax is incorrect and to the casual observer evokes cringe in their mind's eye. That is completely fine because with the help of my tutorial, you can learn how to avoid making similar mistakes in the future.

 Incorrect:

>I though you said...

Correct: 

>I thought you said...


**How can I avoid making the same mistake in the future?**

1. Read a book 

2. Modern devices have a system implemented called ""auto correct"". This technology greatly decreases any subsequent grammar mistakes that one might make.

 I hope my tutorial has been helpful. Cheers! 😁",2020-01-12 16:57:57

Then my gf showed up since we were all in the students lounge, he left since it was a quick trade and i was kinda shy to admit that i play cards to her but i still showed her anyway. 
I was kinda proud on how she kept up her interest on the subject even tho she wasnt in to it.

Was also great to discover that they took my “foot bath” and filled it with dish soap several times so that our sunroom was filled three feet high with bubbles...

Also-when our neighborhood flooded once during a hurricane, they went out to “explore” by floating down the street on plastic sleds with curtain rods for oars ...needless to say, neither stable nor efficient ...

nigxxr,"I am so sad and disappointed and mad this happened to you. Sexual harassment and abuse happens far more frequently than is ever reported and this kind of abuse isn't only perpetrated by the male gender.

The fact that a teacher, a figure of authority would discriminate against you because you're a male... only adds insult to injury. I'm a woman who believes that there should be a safe place for everyone to go for help when they've experienced anything like this and the fact that there is a stigma attached to a male who reports abuse makes me sick to my stomach. A violation is a violation regardless of who the perpetrator and victim are.

What the girl did was wrong. What the teacher did was wrong. I'm proud of you for being brave enough to come forward, it's hard enough for a woman to come forward but because of the social climate it's so much harder for a guy to report incidents like this.

And to all the people who just don't understand, there is NOTHING enjoyable about being violated. I hope you don't internalize any of this rhetoric as it's utter bullshit and has more to do with those people than any connection to the truth or anything you've done.

You did not invite this. You did not deserve it. And yes you absolutely should and deserve to 'complain' about it. Don't be silent. Stay strong. And I hope you have or find some good friends through this. You may lose people who you thought were friends and I'm sorry about that too. Those people don't deserve your time.

I wish you to have a solid support system, this may affect you in ways that you can't predict. Don't listen to anyone who tries to tell you it's no big deal and just get over it. It is a big deal because something like this, especially at your age, can really change you as a person and it's not fair. I hope it doesn't stop you from doing things in life that bring you joy or satisfaction. 

Thank you for posting about this, a light needs to be focused on injustices like what you've experienced. Remember, not everyone is as deluded as these nay sayers, I just hope that some part of this reply brings you comfort or at the very least helps you know you're not alone.

Don't be afraid to reach out for help if you need it, you're worth the effort. If I was there I would ask you if it's okay to give you a big hug but if you didn't want it I  would also understand and respect that. As should anyone in your life.

Take care of yourself and keep your chin up. 💜",2021-05-22 17:13:25

When I was decorated with cross my scoutmaster were saying why he decorated me (and 3 other friends of mine), and he said ""for having golden heart and will to help everyone around.""

p9xrvn,"Ok, so I'm old as shit (turn 25 a week from tomorrow, still in denial), but the best insight I can offer is that when you get a bit older, you'll remember your teens as a highlight reel, sort of like an Instagram v. reality type thing. I know it seems like absolute drudgery right now. I could be the fucking poster boy for having underwhelming teenage years.

Even if you're really lucky, school sucks and everyone hasn't learned how to not be a cunt yet. Even the most well-meaning teens become angsty, hormonal messes here and there, so seemingly meaningful friendships can topple out of nowhere. On top of all this, you start to have some very significant responsibilities without the benefit of being taken seriously by absolutely anyone. Even your more serious problems will sometimes be minimized to ""a lot of people your age go through these sorts of things, but before you know it you'll be looking back and wondering why you ever got so worked up.""

All that said, trust me--when you get to where I am, or even a few years earlier, you're going to kind of gloss over all the boring, frustrating day-to-day shit and be left with a really beautiful set of experiences, memories, instances of profound personal growth, and, if you're lucky, a couple friends to reminisce on the good old days with.

We had our fair share of drug drama and a few upsetting deaths but I figured I would start with fun.

-in sixth grade this new kid was in my gym and he would sneak up behind girls grabbing them, hugging them, being a creep and the notorious class jock called him out for being a pervert. THE JOCK. TURNED FEMINIST. 👀👀

The school cops (2) wore the tightest skinny jeans I have ever seen. They were well respected by the students and pretty funny tbh. 

Lunch time rolls around and it’s the indoor student 3v3 soccer tournament in the gymnasium. About 200 people fill the raised stands watching the action. The school “smoke pit” was right outside the emergency exit doors under the stands, off school property technically. One of  your classic shit disturber students decided it would be funny to take the fire extinguisher 🧯and blast everyone from underneath grandstands. 
Causes a huge commotion and everyone starts running 
To get away. The cops try chasing the kid out the emergency doors and down a steep grass hill and their jeans were so fucking tight they both fell like 3 times on the wet muddy grass.

That’s it.

Nothing came of it, other than a couple students getting in school suspension for a couple days.

High school was pretty chill, only thing of note was an incident when the school got locked down when there was a report of an armed individual near the school.

Edit: oh and there were multiple nudes being passed around every year, I guess kids at my old high school were really dumb and horny. 😅

My freshman year was just filled with stupid lockdowns and shit but towards the end of the year a girl brought a whole book bag filled with edibles and *passed them out in class*, she got caught btw aaand the police had to get involved.

Our close friend group knew about her suicidal tendencies, the school even knew as well and did F all to help. She use to discreetly cut herself in class, she knew she’d be able to get away with it because we were too afraid to alert the teachers in class.
Our friend group found out about the attempted hanging as it was going around school- we all automatically went to the reception asking to speak to someone to find out if it was our friend (we couldn’t find her anywhere).

i2b2pk,"Let me tell you my way of life. I live with my parents (im not of age yet) and i live in my room. I pray to a God that no one else believes in. My curtains are thicker than Scarlett Johansson. I haven't opened my windows in months. Neither have i actually spoken to my family. I barely eat. I live in ABSOLUTE darkness. I play games on a rickety old Asus Zenfone. I dont have a laptop. Why? All because a certain girl decided to play me and when she got bored, decided to ruin me on facebook. Yes, you DO have a chance of finding yourself a good friend in a girl and she MIGHT even go out with you and it MIGHT work out. But the risk is too high. And the things at stake are too priceless. I cannot show my face in society for a mistake i did not make. Dont end up like me. P.S: This isnt a joke. Relationships are explosively dangerous. Think if you wanna risk it.

i2b2pk,Don't worry just remember not many have that sort of courage to ask their crush out so I rate you 100%.

fhxxv5,Another thing is that if you do give us a complement please dont be offended by not much of a response or a response which doesnt seem that polite. We are happy for all the complements people give us (if they aren't patronising or sarcastic) some of us just aren't used to many so we dont know how to respond.

No, Karen, I'm not quiet because I want to hurt people. 

I have friends out of school. Ones that I chose to be around. I won't even know you in a year, unless you count the small talk I'll make when you shovel my fries for me.

Oh, and also, I'm focussing on doing well in school. If it's between me examining the pebble of a personality you have and getting a good job, it's the job. Literally anyday it's the job. I don't find your racist/homophobic/asshole jokes funny. They're tiring. And stolen from the front page of google.

If anyone talked to me it was to abuse me. I was just quiet to try and not draw attention to myself. I would’ve been a good friend if anyone had tried. Anyway - just hang in there. Once you get out of school it gets better 😊",2020-03-13 18:04:21

gqeua8,"Ok, mom lurking the sub in preparation for when my little ones get to their teen years here to share some info!

Luckily for me I had no stretch marks until after pregnancy. Understandably so, when it happened I went to see my dermatologist to get some knowledge straight from the source.

My very awesome doctor (who can be honest to a fault) told me that the don't ever go away completely. There are some laser treatments to soften the look but she wouldn't recommend anyone to spend that kind of money on such a treatment unless they were going to be walking the runway.

The big kicker? They are genetic. Can you get them if you gain a lot of weight or grow very fast, yes. Still, you can be in the best shape ever, gain the minimum amount of weight recommended during pregnancy and if your genes say you're gonna have them, you will have them.

They do fade a lot with time. I'd say about two years after my youngest you have to look very closely to see them. You can help minimize the look and texture by having a good diet, drinking lots of water, moisturizing, and keeping them out of the sun.

Good luck with life guys! Luckily, while stretch marks suck, they won't affect your life much in the long run 😁.",2020-05-26 04:12:23

With MySpace, you just needed to ask for a ""fan sign"" with their MySpace number ID in it. I'm betting there's a similarly easy way with current social media. Teach your youths properly and they can have safe fun like these two! 🤷‍♂️😁🖤",2021-04-06 16:48:04

His joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took him a total of like 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? His joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. He outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭

In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as ""R/Wooooosh"" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile.

gchru3,"90% of the people on the internet who say they have depression and anxiety are faking it cause they think they’re quirky. Nobody is gonna proudly and happily say they have depression and make fun of themselves if they have depression. Or if they aren’t joking or flexing their depression, it could still be fake. Take most of this sub as an example, where all of a sudden, tons of people on this sub have gone such a similar amount of time (100-200 days) without hurting themselves.

Edit: I’m not surprised I’m negative downvotes, as this sub is where the issue is at it’s worst, and other teenagers feel the need to be quirky. Not my fault they can’t think of an original post instead of a fake sob story 🤷‍♂️",2020-05-03 03:51:06

So I was going to a hockey game with my friend and me and my mom are big fans of the WWE. So since today is Monday my mom was watching it while I was at the hockey game. During the hockey game my mom keeps on telling me a bunch of spoilers that happen during the show. I didn’t care much because I already seen it on Instagram. But I decided to joke around with my mom and said, “Stop sending me this 😂 I wanna watch when I get home” Then she texts me back...

“I’m sorry.. I know you’re not trying to get stupid with me on the phone you better learn your role and learn who tf your texting.”

I tell her it was a joke and since she knows nothing about reddit I r/woooosh her.

She then replies, “dude stop texting me you already pissed me the fuck off”",2019-11-26 04:07:48

Yes, even if you are living at a friend’s or you have a place for yourself. This classification affords you certain rights. Talk to your school district’s homeless liaison (every district should have one) and get help with clothes, food, community resources, registering for food assistance/Medicaid, etc. They will also provide you a form that says you are unaccompanied youth and therefore allowed to make your own medical decisions, etc. without a parent or guardian. 

If you are a senior, you can get a one year full scholarship to college. Please talk to your homeless liaison and get help if you are in this situation! Our tax dollars pay for you to have this resource, and you can pay back into the system when you’re back on your feet, so don’t feel bad taking advantage of resources available to you♥️",2020-12-04 13:54:12

“your shirt. grateful dead? do u have a favorite song”

“oh sorry idk what band that is”


:/ like ok lol

like if ur basic but actually listen to a few good bands then you do you but pls just actually 𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑛 to them- my step sister has pink floyd, beatles, metallica, journey, and a few other t-shirts like that and ive only ever heard her listen to the beatles like once bc she always is listening to rap or like- AJR or some shit idk. so i asked what her favorite song by them was and she went “idk i dont really know any song titles or anything” and im like 🧍‍♀️that would be a fair argument if i hadnt known u my whole life, been ur sister for 9 years, and know for a fact u don’t listen to the beatles",2021-08-05 21:20:20

n6uaaq,"Second vaccination circa two days ago 😎. Seriously though, that sounds horrible dude. Hope it cools down there soon.",2021-05-07 12:11:14
n6uaaq,"I too live in India (Jharkhand)and here the government has fairly said to wear a mask even inside your homes as it has been found that this virus is airborne and lemme just share my personal experience- I was the most careful person you would ever meet regarding these covid protocols. Before the lockdown happened in my state I used to go cycling twice a day for more than an hour wearing double masks! I didn't come in contact with anyone except my family members! My dad who lives in another city which is less than an hour away from mine, came home after completing his important judgments andcuz later (after a few days after his arrival) started showing some symptoms like cough and cold even though he recently took a covid test and tested negative! This continued for more than 3 days and after that, he decided to return to his home (in another city) and take a covid test again. So he packed all his stuff and went and later that day his report came positive!!

I, my mother, and my 8 yo Lil brother isolated ourselves insides our home and decided to get tested since we were in his contact. We had to wait for 2 days for the tests to take place due to the heavy traffic! So finally we got our rt-PCR tests done and later that day our reports came pointing out that I and my mother were covid positive!! By God's grace, my Lil brother tested negative. It was very low in mine but a mild (medium) one in my mother!

After that, we all took our medicines and after a few days, my parents got a CT scan done and found out that they have pneumonia which is very common in covid patients nowadays due to the new variant!! So they had to take more than a dozen medicines twice every day!

On the tenth day of being covid positive and the 12th of my dad, we again took an RT PCR test for the whole family and my mom and dad tested negative, my Lil brother again tested negative. But I remained positive even though I did not have any symptoms except a loss of smell which I slowly retained back!!

Well, today's my fourteenth day in isolation (the last), and will get tested again tomorrow pray that I test negative.

EDIT: My parents are doing fine but I guess it will take some time for them to recover from pneumonia. My dad had taken his first dose of the covid vaccine but my mother couldn't cuzz our government recently opened the vaccination drive for people below 45 and above 18.

And even the doctor told that hadn't my dad taken his first dose of vaccine he could have had severe symptoms! 

So folks make sure your parents, grandparents, and even you (if you are eligible) take at least the first dose of the covid vaccine cuzz its very very important!! Also that if we all wore masks inside our homes I and my mother would have been saved from this virus.

And please isolate yourself as soon as you see any symptoms 🙏🙏",2021-05-07 14:15:28

gg8xcz,"Nope. Been to four high schools now, popular kids are often dicks, I read a lót, and sometimes I get made fun of. There are less (but still are) ""mean"" girls, I agree, but way more manipulative girls, who fuck you up just as bad. I don't go to a school where there are uniforms, but my family in the UK does. But yeah, though the cafeteria is definitely populated, most people bring their own lunch. 

Oh and btw. I've written tons of letters to my crushes. (Although not as an introduction letter, only further in the relationship. Even worse; with poetry for them... So not something you want to leave for the popular kids to find.)

I know people who watch films like; To all the boys I loved before, because they're espécially relatable... 🤷🏼‍♂️

And maybe getting shoved into a locker makes a better movie than just shouting mean things.",2020-05-09 08:15:48

Out of 27 public high schools in my county, the average student body was 1772 (using 2017-18 school year data). The smallest HS having a student body of ~880. 

Also, in my state, there’s only 50 high schools with a student body larger than 3k. Only 10 of those 50 have more than 4K students.

mkf367,"It goes MUCH, much deeper than just calories.  

You CAN, OBVIOUSLY, ""trust"" & ""believe"" what YOU want- thats the ""gift"" of this world, BUT- it can ALSO, be YOUR demise, ""choosing"" to ""trust"" & ""believe"" in the ""systems"" that no longer work or that no longer serve you. Continuing to eat poorly, bc you DONT WANT TO ""believe"" there's bad stuff in it- would you keep eating it all, all the time? I would hope not. 

Choose to read below, carefully. I struggled for years, with trying to understand why I had been lied to- why SOOO MANY people, my family, MLIONS of other families had been lied to- hanging onto anger, resentment, blah, blah- it only hurts YOU!

HOLD onto a water bottle arm stretched outward, extended FULLY- water bottle in hand: for 30 seconds.
Now for 5 mins. 20 mins- yeah right. That water bottle, is your emotions. Is holding onto it longer, ""helping you""? 
No, its hurting your muscles and making you fatigued. Same goes with your emotions that no longer serve you.

On with explaining this for you and for others who may not be able to connect the dots. Irs a complex answer. 
A ""Dr"" that my Grandmother went to for her ""Chemo"" mentioned a few things to her and I was holding her hand when he said these things.
For instance, (and I quote)
""I want you to know something that WILL NEVER, be on the ""news"". Yeast, also known as ""Candida Albicans"", is the only similar ""thing"", found in EVERY type of Cancer. Try your best not to eat as much of those foods as possible that have ""yeast"", ""yeast extract"", ""autolyzed Yeast Extract"", ""monolyzed Yeast Extract"", etc. Those WILL ALL have a negative effect on your recovery of this. So for yours, your children and for your grandchildren sakes- please try to stay away from these foods as much as you possibly can.""

Btw, SUGAR- ALLLLL types of sugars along with that which breaks down into animo acids, sugar amino acids, SUGAR feeds ""yeast""! Sugar, literally feeds ""Candida Albicans"".
(I hope to God, if anyone out there who has this, thrush, yeast infection, jock itch, etc- no one is talking about it bc its ""embarrasing""- I get it, but if we don't talk about it, figure out the ""culprit"" then WE WILL, continue to be ""RULED"", ""KILLED by it"", and ""fed"" the foods we aren't aware- are ""feeding"" the bad bacteria, more than our good bacteria.) Your GUT- IS your ""micro-biome"". THAT, NEEDS to be settled"". 
If anyone out there is struggling with this right now, don't turn your other cheek on what I'm saying. I have nothing to gain and I can't care what ""Doctors"" say. I've been put into a COMA, TWICE- by ""simple"", ""safe"", ""flu-shots"" when I was 11 and again at age 13.
A COMA. For 9 days the first time and 17 days the second time. No one gave my mom answers and they TRIED to keep taking blood work. My aunt, my moms sister- at the time was the ""Hospital IV Specialist""- was THREATENED, ""NOT to say a word about your nieces case or you'll NEVER, EVER work in the health Care Industty- EVER again! Do I make myself clear?""
After soaking 20yrs of her life into worki g for that hospital, she handed in her RESIGNATION, the DAY he threatened her! She apologized to my gram, saying, ""I know you wanted whats best for me when you brought us here but I can't support a system so corrupt! I WAS THREATENED, by the Director of the hospital, not to say why (she- me) WAS in a coma from a ""flu-shot"" but none of us got that sick except you, Ma!"" She was dosed with heavy, toxic metals. You can't sue bc of a ""Law"" made in 1985, and there's nothing we can do- I RESIGNED!

She now, has run her own cleaning company, employing 25 people, (give or take 2 or 3 people more or less) for the last decade! I'm so proud of her for standing up and coming forward. This nonsense HAS TO STOP! 
This narrative isn't helping ANYONE, AT ALL.

Your body is just as much its OWN ""environment"" as everything else in this world.

BTW, my Grandmother is a 4 time, Cancer Survivor.
Breast Cancer 2x. Lung Cancer. Colon Cancer.
Her husband, 2 time Survivor. My Mother was ""diagnosed"" when she was pregnant with me, at the age of 20. My younger sister, 24 when she was pregnant with my niece- was ""diagnosed"" with cervical cancer (same as my Mom) and my sister had the tumors removed after she had my niece.
My younger sister, ALSO received a check from the ""Johnson & Johnson Co."", bc her daughter had a HOLE IN HER BRAIN- (by what her ""GYNO-"" recognized- right off- asking, ""are YOU using any ""baby powder"" by ""Johnson & Johnson""?  To which she replied to with, ""well, duh- it IS 100+, everyday- and you know I have sweating issues!"" [I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS- -> I watched the ""Dr"" LITERALLY, SLAP her hand to her forehead, with disbelief!] 🤦‍♀️🤯
I said, ""I tried telling her!"" 
My sister says, ""telling me WHAT?"" The ""Dr"" replied, ""THROW. THE. CRAP. OUT. and call this number. She gave her a card to a reputable attorney ""Co"", they're brothers, and she ultimately won a settlement of quite a bit of money. Thats what I'll leave that at. 

I remain, the ONE and only grandchild, on both Maternal & Paternal sides- that STILL, has never been ""diagnosed"" with cancer. I won't vent my age but I've just passed 30. Take it with a grain of salt, but you can do your own research- (this info won't be allowed to be ""reached"", ""found"", ""answered""- by ""Google"". I've been saving ""screenshots"" on things that ""Google"" has been LYING about. And I will share 1 of them in a few moments once I post this.)

For the younger generation to begin eating healthier, THAT- IS how ""the people"" will go back to having their OWN control and power over their own bodies and how they look. 
Apparently, there's SOMETHING that I'm doing right- to be the FIRST & ONLY, from both sides of my family, to not be ""diagnosed"" with something almost my entire family has been diagnosed with and received ""chemo"" for- multiple times!
I don't like the idea that I have been lied to either, but will continuing to ""trust"" & ""believe"" ""them"", help ME? Will continuing to ""trust"" & ""believe"" ""THEM"", HELP YOU?
I can vouche that it hasn't worked for MY OWN Family.
What about YOURS? Will YOU keep quiet and turn the other cheek when it comes to your family's health?
We need to be eating more varieties of ""root vegetables"". They contain something that the Big ""C"", CANT tolerate or attach to.

Again..
""Google"", WILL NOT give you this info. ""Humanity"", ""the people"" and ""the mASSes"", are ALL being kept in the dark and LIED TO. The more you depend on ""Pharma"", the less money, your health declines and YOU become ""DIS-ease""/""ILL-ness"" riddled! 
Not the ""Doctors"". We HAVE to acknowledge that we are in an ""information war"" [..BUT NOT, to sit angry, mad, passed off- but to simply TRANSCEND those negative feelings- in other words,, feel it and let it go- this is will result in a 2 step, but ""humanity"" will be the ones to benefit- not ""Gov"" or ""Pharma""] 
""Humanity"", ""The People"" NEED TO take it upon OUR SELVES to do our OWN ""DUE DILLIGENCE"" to research our OWN info- from sources NOT invested in YOU, getting sicker and sicker.

A cheap, $5 Chia seed / flax seed bag at ANY Health Foods, Health Co-Op Foods Stores, (NO Amazon, Etsy, eBay, Walmart) go to a ""vegan"", ""hippie"" store.
Many of you KNOW where these stores are because your parents may buy one or 2 things from there.
Growing your own small amount of microgreens- JUST what you'll eat-  is a great, easy, JUST-TOO-SIMPLE way to start getting more nutrients into our bodies. Microgreens. Many of these nutrients, are what our bodies are missing. I KNOW I've noticed a HUGE difference between ""with"" and ""without"". 
Even if you can get some into your diet just 3-4 days a week. Its better than nothing/none.",2021-04-18 18:33:08

c20pdy,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Reddit memes. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of meme culture and the entire world itself most of the jokes will go over a typical scroller’s head. There's also Reddit’s godly outlook, which is deftly woven into this app- the meme are inspired from what happens in this world, for instance. Redditors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Reddit truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Reddit’s constant reposting of the same format, which itself is a cryptic reference to how we humans steal from each other and try to build upon someone’s idea in ways it wasn’t meant to. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Reddit’s genius wit unfolds itself on their PC or mobile. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂",2019-06-18 15:42:01

And eat them! When we'd try to pry the condom from its mouth, this motherfucking dog would growl at us, all territorial-like!!  
My room-mate would then come home.. pick up this dog.. and the dog would... Lick her face... After having munched down on a period-blood-coated-full-of-cum franger.

Obviously I need teaching for stuff I don’t know. 

But I use a Chinese method of multiplication, and I use my own way of doing division and some algebra too. 
It works just as well as the standard way, and I still get it right too. 
At first I got some comments asking what it was, but in general, the teachers let me do it. 

When I was younger, I was ambidextrous. But my teachers told me I shouldn’t write with my left hand, and only use my right.
I really wish they’d just let me use both. 

At least now, I’ve re-harnessed it (or whatever 😂), and I write with both hands all the time and no-one cares. 

Anyway. Hope your Maths teacher is actually OK.

Was my penis about to pop? Or veins about to blow up and kill me?

Then i 'braved' it and thought i was about to make a FATAL mistake but the result was a euphoric and comfortable and slightly stingy and painful feeling and i had no fucking idea what all that white piss was and i ran to the bathroom to check for blood.

And with keemstar wanting etima to jump off a bridge, which no human with a right mind would do, and then everyone spamming  ""🤡"" on his tweets and his livestream(at sometimes can be very funny and sometimes he would react to the funny videos) just felt like they didnt care whether or not he was ok. I  found out about the video today and seeing all the news and I drop everything I'm doing to look at it.... And on top of that people are really trying to advertise off of his death(this ignorant kid made a live stream called ""etika died now can I get free sub's"" and another person made a video called""etika reacts to his own death""), and its absolutely disgusting how people don't see how thats insanely wrong. And the videos that try to spread the word and pay respects to him, get disliked more than the disrespectful videos. The hell is wrong with some people.",2019-06-25 22:18:02
c5bptp,F 😭😭😭😭😭,2019-06-25 22:39:18
c5bptp,Fuck me I miss him already 😓,2019-06-25 22:47:00
c5bptp,I never watched his videos but I heard about him from others. Mostly his reactions to smash characters. I wish he got the help he needed and deserved before he did what he did. I hope he rests in peace 😔,2019-06-25 22:48:21
c5bptp,"Bro I SHIT YOU NOT, I've been a big Etika fan, always been for at least the past 6 years. But I haven't looked him up recently, not for the past 2 months or so. But this morning, I'm chilling at home, and I randomly, out of the blue remember a certain reaction video of his, the one where he watches the Rappin' for Jesus video, and the part where the pastor goes ""My love for Christ just keeps getting bigga"", and Etika is just shocked cuz he knows *exactly* what the pastor will say next xD absolutely hilarious. So i watch a few more videos of him. I shit you not, maybe 10 minutes later, my friend texts me, ""I don't know how to break this to you."" I'm like ""Aww what's up?"" ""Etika's bpdy was found under a bridge, most likely suicide."" ""Hell no"". I look it up, and yep, there it is. Ironically how I haven't watched him in like 2 months, and the moment I decide to look him up, I get news that he passed? Like there was some kind of spiritual next level shit bond there, like his ghost came to notify me that he passed before I got the news.

But anyways, I cried a few times during the day, not gonna lie. Etika was the only YouTuber I actually gave a shit about besides YoungKingDave (who also passed, sadly), and Filthy Frank (now doing other things, sadly for me, good on him tho). Etika has been a huge part of my humor, my growth, and how I am as a person. When I was down for whatever reason, he would always brighten up my day with his personality, his over-the-top reactions, his charisma. He would always make the viewer feel like they were a part, like they were one of the homies. 

Etika, I know you said you will simply be forgotten, replaced. That is not the case, you simply cannot be replaced by anyone else. The unique individual who's charisma and edginess infatuated us all. You are one of the greatest internet personalities of all time. In your latest video, you also said you'd miss out on Attack on Titan. I felt that, bro. And now I am going to miss out on you. One of the people whom I truly wanted to get to meet in person. But anways, I truly hope you are resting in peace with God, and I also hope to see you up there. Much love ✌💙",2019-06-25 22:51:28

Everyone just always plays it off as ""oh he's back at it again he'll be fine he's just a 🤡"". But imagine how that makes him feel. To see all these people against him and nobody even reaching out to support him. Everyone's too busy making fun of him to actually realize there is something really wrong. And now it's too late, we can't go back. 

I hope people take this as a lesson. People on social media feed off hating on others. There are entire fucking YouTube channels dedicated to documenting the fall of people. It's to the point where we don't see these people as human. At this point we see it as a reality show, nothing is real. 

Be kind to people. It's the most important thing you can do. Even if someone messes up, believe in them, help them find a better path. Because the worst thing in this world is to know that you're alone.",2019-06-25 20:31:18

cyb47p,"I had to delete a r/whooosh copypasta because people were taking it seriously and it was the most obvious copypasta ive ever seen

Copypasta: WOW kid you just got r/WOOOOOOSHED!!!! 😂😂👀

""Wooosh"" means you didn't get the joke, as in the sound made when the joke ""woooshes"" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! 😤😤😂

His joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took him a total of like 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? His joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. He outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭

In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as ""R/Wooooosh"" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as ""Schadenfreude,"" which means ""harm-joy"" 😬😲.

12dia1p,"You can do it! I know you can! I've been through surgery, radiation, and plenty of chemo. I had my cancerous tumor (glioblastoma stage 4) removed about 1.5 years ago, and my mood has completely changed! I used to be very irritable and short tempered, and getting worse every day, to the point where my wife was considering divorce. But turns out, it was my tumor causing my attitude!

Now, I'm not sure how long I have left, but so far, everything looks great! My marriage is healthy again, and I've been given a second chance at life. I pray and wish for the same for you, that it'll get rid of all traces of that evil cancer and you'll live your life as it should be lived! Cheers 😁",2023-04-06 15:29:48

m7td9p,"Sampling is illegal if you go about it the wrong way. Generally, you need to get permission from both the owner of the sound recording and the copyright owner of the musical work.

>When you mature and grow up you will realize that originality is one of the most key life skills and it's clear that we haven't matured to that stage yet. 😴

Buddy, there's seven fucking notes in each musical key. There are bound to be similarities between songs, timbre, and rhythm. Kanye West's ""New Slaves"" is sampled. Rihanna's ""Work"" is sampled. There is no way somebody can be 100% percent original. Inspiration is the root of being original/creative; putting a spin on something and creating something different and new is part of and a result of being inspired.

Speaking of which, how do you get permission to use a sample? You obtain a [mechanical license](https://www.harryfox.com/#/), which is not too hard to do. If you're planning on using multiple samples/recordings however, you still need permission from each respective owner. 

At this point, what you're creating (from a legal perspective) is a ""derivative work"". One mechanical license isn't enough, you need to deal directly with the song owner and publisher. Some of these publishers are ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, and so on. 

What OP did is he took songs for his backdrop under a *Creative Commons* license, which is a fancy term for royalty-free and subjective fair use (in which the copyright notices must be kept intact/secure and pertain to its guidelines, which are usually supplied from a direct source or a third party, like a website).  

The most attribution you need to give in this case is credit to the artists in the bio/description and then you're fine. It's like the stock photos, but of music. YouTube actually has their own CC song library for creators to use in their videos with proper attribution.

Just because we are young does not mean we are stupid. Get your boomer mentality out of your ass, and stop pretending that you don't have to offer up an explanation when prompted just because you're ""old and wise"" and supposedly know better.",2021-03-18 17:05:26

iqwbb8,"Bro she said no so fucking quick 😆. I never talked to here for more than 10 seconds anyways, i just can beleive how quick she said no 😆",2020-09-11 21:25:08
iqwbb8,"No i definetly respect that, but she didnt have to say that ting so aggressively 😆. She acting like im a priest and she a child or sumn",2020-09-12 00:06:13

iqwbb8,"Yah it’s invasive so what suck it up and move on

I’m bout to get commented on a lot 😤",2020-09-12 01:13:22
iqwbb8,"unpopular opinion here... the teacher was probably just joking people shouldn’t immediately jump to “he’s a creep” i actually like when my teachers tease the students. it adds a little happiness and excitement to my classrooms anyways. everyone, teachers included, are always looking for ways to “roast” or tease one another. it’s all fun and games you guys don’t gotta bash them 🤦‍♀️",2020-09-11 23:52:20
iqwbb8,No it’s not 💀 how is it rude to express that you don’t have feelings for someone? He’s being a little bitch about it. She doesn’t have to play dumb to spare his feelings he’s being very selfish. if she hadn’t said no the whole class would’ve probably taken it as a yes and teased her about a nonexistent crush  and he probably would’ve taken it as yes too and then he’d be posting about how she “led him on” by not saying no immediately. Imagine how uncomfortable she would feel. Most other people would have said no too because it’s the reasonable option.,2020-09-11 23:47:17
iqwbb8,"You weren't there, man. I obviously wasnt expected her to say yes, but she said no with such confidence 😥",2020-09-11 21:34:09

iqwbb8,Hey. Im not very good at talking to girls 😆,2020-09-11 21:40:09

iqwbb8,Thank you for genuinely not being an asshole ✌️,2020-09-11 22:25:06
iqwbb8,"I dont care about downvotes. I got 20k upvotes, why would i care about 36 downvotes 😆. But yeah that teacher a certified school threat",2020-09-12 00:12:42
iqwbb8,"You werent there. Like i said, it's how she said no. She practically made a mockery of me bruh 💀. I understand that she sad no but she said that word with such aggression 😆",2020-09-11 23:58:35
iqwbb8,🙏,2020-09-12 00:05:22
