I know this is Utah. But, even in Arizona, God, there are some incredible places. It's not all dust and desert. Some amazing hidden oasis spots, beautiful and lush forests up north, creeks, rivers, valleys, vast expanses of mountains. It's beautiful. I had a friend from England who said he loved Utah and Arizona because they are like a completely different planets from the rest of the nation.

Used to HATE living in Arizona as a child. Now, even though I hate the heat of Phoenix, I treasure all the hidden gems across the state I have gotten to discover, learn to love, and appreciate now that I'm a grown-up and can drive and travel around my state with my family.

When my husband and I finally do our honeymoon, we want to do a Historic Route 66 cross-country trip (well, as far as Route 66 will take us) starting in Arizona. Come visit us in the west! The heat may make us a bit crazy but the landscape is incredible. ☺️

17y0k2y,"Sorry to hijack this thread.

Somewhat new to the photography field/hobby. Did you take this on an SLR, or a DSLR? 

I guess I'm curious about the camera settings you used (ISO, shutter speed, aperture):
- daytime, and image isn't grainy, so maybe ISO 100-ISO 250
- landscape with most areas in focus, so I presume smaller aperture for wider depth of field
- daytime, so bright enough, although really dark darks on left, so maybe 1/250, 1/500

It looks like an analog pic, but I presume the same (vintage) effect might be achieved with modern day cameras.

Thanks for your time and effort! 😁

78l06q,"There are two main ways to get here but I was forced to take the less popular start point at Mt Shark trailhead (the advised way is to take Sunrise, i think that’s what it’s called, near Banff and hike one way to Mt Shark and be driven back to the start). So I did it as an out and back. It’s close to 20 miles each way so one or two days each way and then you would want at least one full day to explore. This is the most popular area for obvious reasons 😊",2017-10-25 08:12:21

Most other places this is common practice to protect from the pirates out there but I’ve since realized that anyone who steals will steal anyway. I’ll definitely not watermark in the future.

8pohoo,"Boracay is a party beach, El Nido is for lovers, and Amanpulo is for the very rich. Marketing does make a difference, but you can’t deny that Palawan is “dirtier” now than when it was a local secret — That’s just a normal consequence of use. This all makes me wonder what the local government is doing to make tourism sustainable, especially since Palawan’s allure is due to its ruggedness. Look at Boracay’s local government — They won’t limit the number of tourists because tourists bring money. Problem is the island’s sewage system is already at capacity, so occasionally when there’s a little too many tourists, sewage spills into the ocean. No bueno dude. ☹️",2018-06-09 03:43:01

7ao8ub,"Very happy that The Enchantments remained relatively untouched by very recent nearby forest fires such as the [Jolly Mountain Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolly_Mountain_Fire) among others. I've been visiting and recreating around The Enchantments and the area southeast near lake Cle Elum for the past 10 years. Many people who call the nearby area (including my parents) had to evacuate in August/September, and many very nearly lost their homes/vacation properties.

However, the good news is that the fires burnt down many patches of dead/dieing trees left by the damn infectious bark beatles such as the [Fir Engraver](http://forestry.nv.gov/forestry-resources/forest-health/fir-engraver-beetle/)  and defoliators, namely the [Western Spruce Budworm](https://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/fidls/westbw/fidl-wbw.htm), which in theory should slow the rate in which these insects kill much of the tree in the area.🙌🍻",2017-11-04 11:50:11

We were at Victoria falls at the start of the year and did the helicopter tour around there which was awesome. The photos turned out okay but I'd really like to be able to use it properly. I have an iPhone and the ones I took on there weren't too bad, but with these once in a lifetime experiences it would be so great to be able to take photos well.

Thanks for the recommendation though! And thanks for posting such a beautiful photo of a country that I have a special connection to, even though I have yet to visit.

I hope your trip is as beautiful as your photo is ❤️
",2017-09-17 14:15:49
70msaa,"That's so cool. I have never spoken to anyone else in my life who is 1/4 Mauritian. I don't think I ever met anyone outside my family who was Mauritian until I moved to Australia, and even then we're few and far between. 

All my quarters are a different country too, which are made up of different things in them. So it makes it confusing when people ask my brown skinned face where I'm from and I say England. Or if I find it a rude question from someone I don't know I'll spent 10 minutes giving them the run down 

But hey, welcome to the mongrel club 😉 And hopefully we make it there one day! I'm giving myself 5 years to get there because it's one of the top countries I want to go to, but it's just so damn awkward and expensive to get to. Hopefully you get to go soon too my fellow 1/4 Mauritian friend :)",2017-09-17 14:37:17
70msaa,"German and Mauritian is a pretty awesome combination. My mother is half Mauritian half English and weirdly her and her two brothers are all different colours. She's brown but one of her brothers looks fully white, except he didn't burn in the sun and the other one looks Italian or something. I got the Mauritian colouring as I'm brown but my sister is much lighter than I am. I can be out in the sun for 5 minutes putting washing on the line and I for about 3 shades darker. Catch the sun like nobodies business. White with the ability to tan instead of turning pink must make lots of people envious though. 

It would be a beautiful place for a honeymoon though. I hope that you're able to get out there sooner rather than later! My sister went a few years ago for her 30th and did a bit of travelling and she loved it. 

Super congratulations on your wedding and I hope you get there soon 💕",2017-09-17 14:56:18

Of course now that plantation has been sold and a housing development is going in there.",2022-10-10 13:25:06

y07wro,"Random thought but your comment made me think of it. At the school i work at in the northeast USA the Shaka has become the universal sign for “me too”. Teachers started it because elementary school kids have this insatiable need to loudly vocalize whenever they have something in common with a story another student shares. For example, if a student says during morning meeting that they went to the beach over the summer, every other student who went to the beach is immediately going to start yelling “me too” and then all go into their stories at the same time. This works really well. It’s cute to see a room full of first graders silently 🤙ing when their classmate tells a story.",2022-10-10 16:58:26

His joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took him a total of like 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? His joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. He outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭

hsgu7i,"Awww that brings back some memories! We all went to Miramonte high and we would go up there to have keggers. You had to bury the keg so if the cops showed up they would not take it and you’re not out 200 bucks. One time they did come and we are all scattering in the fog but, I was always the designated cop talker so I stood their. They come up and like 5 of us are standing with solo cups filled with beer and they ask me where the keg is. I said that there is no keg, he asks where we got cups of beer.... and I said WE FOUND IT😂 Still gives me a giggle. He just slapped the cups out of our hands and told us to go the fuck home. Anyway, that fog was super awesome except we never found the keg! Had to pay for it anyway. Somewhere up their is a buried keg of Sierra Nevada about 15 years old!",2020-07-16 23:58:00

m747lc,"Yea I noticed that mentioned further down. I had never seen Justin Peter’s version though and it’s really cool too. I will say I prefer the OP’s version though. Much more immediately striking, in my opinion. As for the name, it was just coincidence 🤷🏻‍♂️",2021-03-18 01:27:15
m747lc,And be careful calling it a photo lest the nomenclature police see it 😂,2021-03-18 01:29:54

m747lc,"Odd you would opt to ignore the OP's own words calling it a composite and prefer to get triggered over a compliment.

But I guess hostility in interactions is normalized these days. 🤷‍♂️

You keep doing you buddy. 🤣",2021-03-17 23:48:55
m747lc,"🧐 Bud, the whole point of reddit is community commentary.

That in mind, blunt speech isn't the issue here. The hostility is when you take things as personal attacks and lash out at commentators in areas unrelated to the initial work. This by definition is toxic communication that offers little to no meaningful contribution to the community. Many see it as an attempt to reduce engagement and in turn act as a disruption to a community.

You're accurate to refer to the work as composite photography. Since that is the form of art we're referring to and in the art/photography world we refer to modified photographs as composites not photographs.

This is no different than the distinction between saying a render vs painting. As an example.

I liked the composite, the name and voiced concern over it being referred to as a photo. That's it. This isn't abnormal conversation.

I don't think anyone will publicly judge you for saying photo. But it helps artist like this one and photographers if we can call things what they are so that consumers can articulate what they want concisely in the future.

If you didn't intend to be hostile it helps to self moderate. Deleting personal attacks are well within your control. 👍",2021-03-18 00:41:35
m747lc,"And uh, I’m not your bud, guy. 😛",2021-03-18 00:45:44

7ldsce,"What is essentially life? Thought about it?
Life is a number, notable for bright impressionable moments.
Try to remember the day 18 October 2013: if this day was not the day of Your (or loved one) and if this day there was nothing bright and unusual and if You don't keep a diary where you write every day, it is likely that this day, October 18, 2013 will go into oblivion; in the case of his birthday, mainly remains only the bare date. And how many such days which do not remember?
Every time I make something unusual in life we acquire tab, exactly as in the book — a bookmark of that memorable day. Perhaps the date we missed, but the experience will stay with us for a long time. Just need to remember them often with loved ones.
Has been Alaska tour in Peru to fly, but the wallet have so far only 0,01614 BTC (hopefully in the future a large amount😎),and so ladies and gentlemen, it is possible after all to collect with the world on a hundred, five hundred stasek, from people's not to be, the more a person voluntarily gives this a pleasant feeling in my soul will remain. Here try😏

Calm and confident by clicking on the link ""translate"" to the address bitcoin wallet 1L7ktq2KF7RW5fQY4gXmAUjjeyYpvFbkej in your bitcoin wallet, you give me the tab, that day, when I sit on the floor of the gazebo in which to curl the breeze is calm and gentle around singing those same birds and the same shaman will be whistling the same tune all the same that will be reflected in my memory( and the Internet have information about Alaska tours, if interested)

e96tgj,"Turn your world upside down and take a look through my eyes for a sec👀

I first shot an image [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/7x0oh9/reflecting_in_yosemite_oc36485472/) in February 2018. That version was a favorite of mine, but I felt like something was missing. One day brisk day 9 months later in November, I was walking across Housekeeping Bridge when the conditions were perfect. The water had calmed down. A few clouds were in the sky, still illuminated by the sun after it's  light had risen off the foreground. This image is one of my favorites. I love watching people's reactions when they are trying to figure out what is going on in the picture. ""Wait... why does the sk- Oooooooh!""

Turn your phone upside down if you haven't figured it out yet

I am a local here! I have been living and working in Yosemite Valley for the last 6 years now! If you would like to see more of my Yosemite photography swing by my website [rjfranklin.com](https://rjfranklin.com) or check out my IG which is updated more frequently [@franklinsteinnn](https://instagram.com/franklinsteinnn)!

798cmn,"I dropped acid a few times. It's not something I'm jumping at to tell everyone. One time I was watching Planet Earth and saw a gazelle get ripped apart, I was in the middle if eating and I thought my teeth were shredding my mouth apart. As far as I'm concerned the animal should rip that gazelle apart. Yeah it's nothing like the battery farms we have in America and the rest of Europe, there's no dignity in that from such developed countries. The Faroe Islands didn't have a single tree on them for the longest time, until the Industrial Revolution took place, before all the food they had on their little spot of land was sheep, apart from what was in the sea around them. No doubt that's how they found the Wales. It's a matter of family tradition in close knit communities. Again, the world has so many other issues regarding not least of which animals, I don't think it's worth stranger's time slating one small time tradition on an island where that's all it's got. How about Christmas? Those poor turkeys 😭😭😭😭",2017-10-28 14:43:24

First and foremost, and I cannot stress this enough, splurge on helicopter tour (the one without doors). It’s not as scary as it sounds and it was single most amazing experience of my entire life. It is worth it.

If you’re into serious hiking, go to Kalalau trail. If you aren’t, at least drive there and look at it.

Visit Waimea canyon.

If you like chocolate, do a tour at [Garden Island Chocolate](http://www.gardenislandchocolate.com/)

But food at farmers markets.

Visit Queen’s Bath.

Overall expect a lot of hiking, 5 minute rains followed by rainbows, and roosters everywhere.

I’ll add more, if I think of anything else. 🙂",2018-01-28 21:10:38

95fx43,"There's not much shelter, trees are rare. The winds really pick up every night, and not just your average winds, but almost hurricanes. It is also guaranteed to rain, so you'll go to sleep wet, and wake up wet. The ground is always brown and the sky, grey, and you'll never see any other colour except for the red of your own blood when you get caught in an inevitable bramble trap.

There are some nice spots, don't get me wrong. Beautiful waterfalls, forests and meadows, some of the best in England. You just have to work hard to find them 😉",2018-08-08 02:39:48

7nzymi,"I’m American and Verizon was informing me that due to my locational I was being charged international service rates. Then I was back to my regular plan. Repeat. I wasn’t using it so I didn’t really pay much more attention why the thing was vibrating like mofo once I saw it was about rate usage.

The park I was visiting has a well upkept paved path to their waterfall, but if you explore around the forest paths you can get to the bank of a river. You are standing on the edge of Minnesota USA and the other side of the river bank is 🇨🇦 

If you ever get a chance to visit the north shore in the summer, do it! That area takes serious pride in not only it’s wilderness and state parks, but in building strong communities as well.  Food’s a little expensive but local, quality ingredients are standard. I had a summit infused onion burger made from locally grown cattle in a hotel restaurant and it was the best damn burger I ever tasted.

You can get a state park pass and just hit park after park complete with camping, waterfalls, and one on the longest connecting hiking trails in the US. (Duluth-superior trail). If you really wanted to you could spend a week hiking through the Minnesota countryside, occasionally finding a city to eat some of the best food you’ll ever taste.

It was one of most memorable vacations and I know I’ll be back",2018-01-04 07:25:47

8jc5ek,"I’d say no, a 6700HQ and a 960m (more or less same numbers as 750ti) struggles with shaders, granted a few options help quite a bit. Especially with waving leaves/water. However, the motion blur can make it look great. The main problem is actually that you max out the 4GB of VRAM, so you’ll be around mid 40s and you flip one switch and drop to 5.

Truthfully...I really do appreciate this sub very much!!! 💝🌏  It's a treat to catch a glimpse of these places that I wouldn't otherwise get to see.  On top of that...I like ""seeing"" through the eyes of the photographer...and what angle, lighting, perspective, composition, etc were ""selected/ chosen"" in terms of how they captured the photo.   (I don't know how to explain it properly....I know obviously they can't control nature....anyways I'm rambling...)

There is the little Låvenisse, basically a miniature santa, and on Christmas Day you put a bowl of porridge and a glass of milk in the barn to feed him. Some do it because of traditions, others because they believe in it. 

There are some areas in the less populated parts of Norway that have their porridge regularily eaten, and have pranks played on them if they don't put it out. 

I assume the people who believe in the folk tales are in a minority, as there isn't any real evidence of their existence. But then again, there is no evidence against it either. 🤔",2018-01-13 01:11:39

What IS 'existence' or reality ???

I just don’t get it.... how are people walking off trails and getting lost? Are they literally blindfolding themselves or hiking on a cloudy night off trail?

I just got back from 4 days hiking off trail in Wyoming. In my case there’s valley after ridge after valley to understand where the main trail where I started from is at, but... this guy had Mt Saint Helens! Lost the location of a pond... it’s down the slope or up the slope then follow the creek up or down... I just can’t wrap my head around how these people make it through life

There's a lot of cool spots farther south past Pfieffer beach in the Pacific Valley. Like Sand dollar beach, Willow cove.

We also hiked up the Mont Blanc side past the old hotel (there’s an option to take a very expensive red tram which we did not do), hiked down to the glacier from the hotel, and then hiked up and across a few miles to the cable car that stops halfway up on its way up to the top of Mont Blanc. We took the cable car down. That’s not a great description but I can’t recall trail names! The second hike I described was very crowded once we hiked up to the hotel. Without the hike up it’s known for being a family friendly hike.  We didn’t see any glaciers shearing off, but it was shocking to see how much Mer de Glace has melted in the past several years😓My husband is French (from the north) so I hope we’ll get to go back in a few years with his family and check in on the glaciers.",2019-11-01 19:12:45

I'd recommend the Sligichan and Fairy Pool area. When staying in Uig there aren't a whole lot of food options, so make dinner reservations at The Ferry Inn. You'd think in such a small town it wouldn't be necessary, but it is. There were many occasions on our two week trip where we thought we wouldn't need reservations, but were then forced to eat Cup Noodle. 😁 ",2017-07-03 00:39:59

The moon was so bright, for once i actually saw the earth lightend by moonlight instead of street lights and buildings everywhere. And it was so silent and peacefull, that i've never slept better then that night. And then of course the sunrise the next morning😍. Our planet truly is amazing and beautifull.",2018-12-19 13:17:41

dbxbj4,I want a beer 🥺,2019-10-01 23:28:34
dbxbj4,"FYI in Germany there are different kinds of favorite beer depending on the region.
In general I would say HELLES is the most popular in the south (Bavaria) but the further north you come they tend to prefer PILS which is more herby than HELLES. Of course there are plenty of different beers all over the country. WEISSBIER is one of my personal favorites for watching football (7:2 @tottenham).

Someone from the north might be able to give more insight to what's going on in their regions. 

Another interesting fact: the type of glass the beer is served in differs aswell. HELLES is usually drunk out of a 0.5l glass which is very even and little tall. PILS tends to be served in 0.33l bottles with a champagne like glass I'd describe it. WEISSBIER is served in a very tall and thin glass which is the thinnest in the middle so it's perfect for a nice grip. Oh and of course the MAẞKRUG which is the huge 1L glasses they use to serve Oktoberfest Beer (🍻) .

That's all my experience, more experienced beer drinkers are welcome to add to what I said and also correct me on anything wrong. I gotta go now. The WIESN is calling.

79getx,Right I said it felt like “ a enchanted forest” . It’s def not a real forest ! What people are bummed about is that this tree farm is going out of business and this will be all cut down . It’ll be turned into farmland 😅,2017-10-29 21:52:50

TLDR: for my eyes it was magical to see 👀",2017-10-29 14:56:38
79getx,That’s not why some people in Oregon seem bummed about a “harvest”. It’s more because this tree farm is out of business and the new business is going to make it farmland. It’s just pretty is all 😍,2017-10-29 20:05:26
79getx,"It was a tree farm, but the owner sold to another farm company. It’ll be farmland soon. Though the beauty is so amazing here, I wish they would keep a patch 😍",2017-10-29 20:32:05

I highly recommend seeking out an area near you where you can see them in their raw, uninhibited state (your best bet is up high in the mountains, or just anywhere which is far from urban areas with lots of lights.

I shot this one on a 35mm lens, and one on my 20mm. On the 20mm the moon didn’t fully rise, I switched lenses and like an idiot forgot to focus real quick. After shooting this I kept beating myself up about how it’s out of focus and it wouldn’t look good, so I put together the pano from my 20mm and accepted that that was the best I got. A few months went by, I stitched this one together, and like it much more. The focus doesn’t seem to bother me as much as I thought it would. But kudos! You are the first to call me out on this.

e9h61y,"This isn't far from where I reside. MN resident here. That storm was fucking brutal. Never have I see so much snow other than the 91' storm we had here and I came home from hospital that night. I was premature and I guess my folks didn't wanna wait another day 🤷‍♂️. Made it this far tho. 30 somethinq inches of snow. 

This last one was upper 20's inches in 24 hours. My town was fucked. Litterally. Businesses that don't close... Ever. Closed. Few pics below.

ctxaz6,"It’s called the “Emerald Coast” due to particular species of phytoplankton in the water giving it that unique color. And *not* because a pirate ship crashed hundreds of years ago and spilled emeralds all over the ocean floor as Mrs. Moore told us in elementary school... 

The sand is sugar white because it’s actually quartz crystal that’s been carried down from the Appalachian mountain range, ground up over time and deposited on to the coastlines. It makes a telltale squeaking sound when you walk on it and will polish your feet better than any pedicure out there.

6ki2in,"Alcoholism is extreme everywhere in Alaska. A good chunk of the population is blue collar hard working men., so drinking is a regular activity for sport, relaxation, and boredom. 

Another chunk of the population is tourism, many 20-30s aged people, many college students. So drinking and depression also run rampant with them.

Assuming you visited Ketchikan on a cruise, the bus driver is going to tell you everything on an elevated level. Things are way more interesting when you say it's to an extreme. 

Cruise lines bring a lot of money and seasonal work to AK. But other than that.. Ketchikan is a drinking town with a little fishing problem 😉",2017-07-01 06:24:15

After a perfect bluebird day spent skiing small laps in the area, we were pleasantly surprised by this fiery sunset. I could say this sunset left me speechless, but that’d be a lie. In reality, I was sliding around our campsite saying “Holy 💩, this is insane!”

7p7r27,"We’re planning on moving there this spring. But we’re not from California is that still ok 😀. When we were looking at places to relocate, Spokane/couer d’Alene /Boise piqued our interest but I didn’t read anything great about Spokane. And when we flew I. And drove around Spokane we were like definitely nope! Drove to couer d’Alene and was like wow what a beautiful area! We were Impressed. Didn’t really care for Boise though.  So we decided on CDA. It’s closer to my family relatively and close to Canada and all the aweseome ski resorts. Hiking all over and less severe winter than where we are. 

So for a mid 30’s couple who doesn’t care about bar hopping I’m hoping we’ll like it. Just kind of taking a leap of faith. We’re into outdoors, hiking, fishing skiing. And cda seems to have enough restaurants and stuff for when we want to go out. Mostly we just want to live on an acerage, garden, hike with the dogs and not have to worry about bears like where were from. and will be having kids soon so it seems like a good place for that. I work in the medical field and should easily get a job. And husband should be able to get a job in his field as well. 
I promise not to tell anyone about northern Idaho either! But it seems to be a rapidly growing place. And if there’s a massive earthquake on the coast like they predict, we’ll still be good! 😂",2018-01-09 23:19:56

lecaxr,"Heya, lifelong Vermonter here. I’m sorry you feel like you have to ask if it’s safe, please don’t worry about offending folks. It’s terrible we’ve come to this point as a country. I’ll see if I can help. I’m a late 20’s white guy, but I’ll try to answer your question as best I can. Overall the political leaning for Vermont is that more populated areas tend to be more progressive, and more rural is more conservative. That being said there’s a tendency for most Vermonters to just keep to themselves, but we do care about people, especially our communities. Partly while we still have town meetings. I’ve seen/heard of very very few instances of belligerent racism in public. There’s not much diversity here, mostly white, but I don’t get the sense that the non-white folks are treated differently. It’d be foolish for me to assume that things here are perfect, but those who have racist opinions are at lest fairly quiet about it.

I live in the largest “city” in Vermont, a college town called Burlington. (Where Bernie’s office is! 🙌) It’s a lovely place with plenty of interesting things to drive to nearby. Originally from southern VT, smaller town. If you’re concerned I’d maybe recommend visiting one of the larger cities, but the whole state is beautiful, and almost all of the folks I’ve met are very kind to visitors. If you’re not used to it driving in snow can be tricky (or so they say, I don’t drive haha), so if you are in the North East I’d be careful with that.

As for West Virginia, my brother is living there with his Fiancé while she does her residency as a surgeon. He worked for the census for a bit and oh my god he hates it there. Almost every house he stopped at made awful comments or treated him terribly while he was just trying to do his job getting them representation. He was shot at multiple times being told to get off property. Evidently almost every person he’s gotten to know since moving there has been closer to conservative extremism than anything else. From my anecdotal knowledge, I’d visit somewhere else. 

If you have other questions I’d be happy to answer any. Love my state & love to talk to folks about it! 👋",2021-02-07 07:30:56

Don't let those mean conservatives tell you that abortion is wrong. It should be CELEBRATED for certain people 👍😁

7ubyd3,It probably got down into the teens here.  Which in the daytime isn't bad at all but at night with the wind and radiation heat loss can be a bit chilly.  Just have to wear lots of layers and pack more for when you stop!😁 The park is always open but they only plow to the Loomis museum at manzanita lake on the North side and the visitor center on the South side.  It's a lot of fun playing in the park with the snow though even if you have a limited area unless you're willing to snow camp.,2018-01-31 23:24:15

7ubyd3,"I always find it confusing that the moon eclipsing the sun over earth is a solar eclipse, but the earth eclipsing the sun over the moon is a lunar eclipse. Like, shouldn't the latter be called a ""terra eclipse"" or something?

To clarify:

☀️🌗🌍 = Solar eclipse

☀️🌍🌓 = Lunar eclipse

Instead, why don't we say:

☀️🌗🌍 = Lunar eclipse

☀️🌍🌓 = Terra eclipse

?

Since the sun is being eclipsed in both cases, and the distinction is just which is casting a shadow on which.",2018-02-01 02:15:59

7ubyd3,Thanks!  The 4/3 sensor is essentially the same size as aps c.  So while not full frame the can do pretty well.  I mainly like them since it ends up being a much lighter system on average and I like to hike with pretty much every lens imaginable.😁,2018-02-01 04:35:35

You will get wet, if you get lost you will get cold.  Please don’t confuse this with a public park.  About getting lost, if you take two steps off many trails, you are not going to see them.  If unsure, stand still, wait.  Bring a little roll of distinctive surveyor tape.  Leave a piece with friends.  If you get lost, tie little bits so you can tell where you’ve been.

This place is called Stalheim. 

Amazingly that road is one of the main routes across the country. It goes into a tunnel under where the photo was taken from but the old hairpin road I guess you walked along is pretty hairy by bicycle! 
I've been fortunate enough to skydive onto that field (Google 'Innhopp') as well as Gudvangen further down that valley. Btw the world's longest road tunnel since 2000 is further along that route. 

It's truly paradise around there. 

Thanks for posting, this bought lots of good memories as well as being an unusual framing of such a beautiful view--well done!

6c3j4z,"Here is a shot from mid November of 2016 in the Mount Baker area during one of the best sunrises I have ever seen. It had been my goal to get some good light with fresh snow on the trees right before the lake froze, but I missed it just barely! This was the first day after it had started snowing that the weather looked good and MAN was it an awesome 🔥 I really wish the lake hadn't been frozen but I found these cool ice shards and thought they looked pretty neat. The lake is still covered in snow right now, but it should start melting here soon!

For those interested this is Mount Shuksan in the Mount Baker area seen from Picture Lake which is a very popular spot near Artist Point.

Hundreds of people clustered up in a few specific locations in order to watch the sunset line up with Horsetail Fall for only about 15 minutes, making it look like lava pouring off the cliff. The collective excitement and amazement created an awesome atmosphere of positivity that you couldn't help but notice. I hope I can go back someday and experience it all again!﻿

pooz7b,"First things first, does the Milky Way look like this to the naked eye? No. When shooting astrophotography, cameras capture these images by keeping the shutter open for a long amount of time. This allows the sensor to capture more light than we are able to see. 

This photo is a panorama, well, four of them to be exact. It is 7 shots across, and 4 panoramas tall. A total of 28 shots from corner to corner, this image took me roughly 14 minutes to shoot.

I saw the image in my minds eye for a couple years. I went to the Diving Board back in December 2017 and used an app called PhotoPills to determine when I should return for my shot. May 10, 2018 it said. And when the day arrived, nothing would stop me from reaching my destination. A rock fall on the backside of Half Dome leaving the off trail route to this viewpoint in loose rock and debris? A prediction of 40% cloud cover? Even on a new moon, I was somehow able to see Half Dome and the rest of the foreground without any moonlight shining down. This day, for me, was meant to be.

I am a local here! I have been living and working in Yosemite Valley for the last 8 years now! If you would like to see more of my Yosemite photography swing by my website [rjfranklin.com](https://rjfranklin.com) or check out my IG which is more frequently updated [@franklinsteinnn](https://instagram.com/franklinsteinnn)!

""Wooosh"" means you didn't get the joke, as in the sound made when the joke ""woooshes"" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! 😤😤😂

The joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? The joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭

In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as ""R/Wooooosh"" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile.

I understand that we are all individuals and we are all entitled to our individual experiences, but I can’t help but feel like part of a plague when I am among the masses. It has definitely had a negative impact on my photography. Maybe I’ll get over it some day 🤣",2021-02-16 19:36:23

wjj9du,"He is a conspiracy theorist nut job that is anti-vax. In one of his IG stories he referred to himself as a “pioneer” in the field of combining astrophotography, and landscape.  I just about died laughing because his ego is so surreal. 

He then had the audacity to mock other people’s work because they don’t like his work. He then attacks them personally saying they’re likely covered in cheeto dust, or something equally childish. 

This guy lacks all sense of humility, and maturity

82y81s,"We have had a really weak winter so far. Up until last week we had only received like 2” of snow all season. A few days ago we got hit by a storm that left the valley with a foot+. Just snowshoed up to Vernal Fall on the 6th for my bday 😜 and the powder was maybe like 4.5ft deep, jmt was most packed down all the way to the base of Nevada. 

Anyone who reads this there’s a trail out to Vernal made by yours truly. ",2018-03-08 21:58:51

aon7as,"Well, I consider myself a Pacific Northwesterner so I totally get that... Kauai is fantastic but more of a place I’d rather visit than live.... I like snow and seasons and the variety the PNW brings (even though I’m living in Texas right now 😕)",2019-02-09 07:01:17
aon7as,"Depends on what you're interested in. Every island has something unique about it that's basically a must see. I lived on Oahu for 3 years so it's my favorite, but the Big Island was my best vacation (Volcanoes National Park and Mauna Kea were incredible). 

Each island has incredible scenery, hiking, beaches, and food, so you'll have to determine which of the unique things you want to see (the above mentioned for Big Island, Oahu's history/Waikiki, Maui's Haleakala/Road to Hana, Kauai's Na Pali/Waimea Canyon). Obviously those are just the big highlights as there's tons else to see in each place 😊",2019-02-09 04:38:16

aon7as,"Chickens are everywhere! Roosters crow all day, it’s an inside joke about the island that they call it their bird of paradise and have it on t-shirts and all that. They look pretty fancy with their unique feathers. Brings a unique element to the island. 🐓 ",2019-02-09 23:05:32
aon7as,"Like Oahu. 

Naw it’s still a good island though. 🤙🏿",2019-02-09 10:08:50
aon7as,"Oahu is where my husband and I spent the early honeymoon years of our marriage and really made our first home together, it's where I met my best friend, and it's where I got my dog, so basically for all the personal, sappy, sentimental reasons! But it's also the island I got to know most intimately so it really was ""home"" for a short while.

To answer your questions better though, all of the above on people, history, environment, and activities, but that may not necessarily make for the best vacation spot since it is much more populated than the other islands. It made it a wonderful place to live though, minus the traffic 😂 And if you're looking for hiking, kayaking, and beaches, unsurprisingly each island is fantastic in all those areas!

If you have any other in depth questions feel free to PM me. I miss Hawaii a lot so it's always nice to talk about it! ",2019-02-09 05:21:08

aot52i,I grew up and lived in upstate NY for 21 years.  I always tell people I’m from “upstate NY” because people in other parts of the country wouldn’t know where I was talking about if I said the Catskills or whatever.  I don’t think the phrase upstate NY is insulting in any way.  It’s the easiest way to tell people the state you’re from without them thinking you mean the city. 🤷‍♀️,2019-02-09 23:11:27

The Tarbert hotel is a great stay, and their in-house amenities are wonderful. Best scallops I've had since Orkney. Puts you within driving range of some lovely white sand beaches. You can also stay at the Black Houses on the North end of Harris/Lewis. If you're into spirits, the Harris distillery is right off the ferry landing, and if you drive around past Camas Uig and the Callanish stones, there's a Abhainn Dearg. Their first scotch should be nearly ready for bottling!

8u514l,"This is why we ate cup of noodle and canned corn from Bonus most of the trip 😂 my brother even branched out to canned anchovies but I stuck with the cheap carbs. I don’t think I ate one piece of fruit the whole trip (unless yogurt counts).

One cheap food options is visiting bakeries. They have affordable treats and it’s a fun way to experience Icelandic food if you’re on a budget.",2018-06-27 06:00:43

72wtjh,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",2017-09-28 14:33:41

cewsex,The nature/landscape photographers I like most are all people who manage to do what the Hudson River/Lumanist painters did a couple hundred years ago... use light and atmosphere to give a 3 dimensional feel to a two dimensional medium. That’s something I really strive to achieve. 👍🏼👍🏼,2019-07-19 01:44:31
cewsex,"Oh cool, hopefully it wasn’t “Ryan Dyar is a dickhead.” Lol

It’s pretty easy to make photography friends, especially in the PNW where it seems like everyone is a nature photographer. I met my wife through photography, my best friend through photography, and am constantly meeting like-minded new folks out here. 

There’s a ton of Facebook groups that you could join to meet people. West Coast Photographers is a pretty good one and most people are laid back, although I’m not too active on FB so it could be full of asshole these days and I just don’t know. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Also just chit chat with folks on Instagram a bunch. I’ve found photographers to generally be welcoming and eager to meet each other. 

Shoot me a DM on IG sometime if you’re ever up in the Seattle area. 👍🏼",2019-07-19 03:50:28

g1sdq9,"One of the most popular waterfalls in Iceland, this beauty can be found right off the side of Ring Road. During our entire visit, we probably passed this spot a dozen times as we adventured the southern coast of the island. Not because it wasn’t visible, but because of the bus loads of people already there. During our second-to-last night, we booked a hostel in the town of Hella not too far from the falls seen above. As we unpacked our bags for the evening, I noticed an opening along the horizon out west. Having not caught an epic sunset the entire trip thus far, I decided to make an impulse visit in hopes of catching a “fire-falls” event. I’m not sure this is an official term, but it’s where the setting sunlight illuminates a waterfall. Lucky for me, and a few others that evening, we got just that! The sky didn’t catch too much color, but I kind of like the dramatic blue storm clouds in contrast to the setting sun. Hope you enjoy!

This is actually close to Banff, the main trailhead (Sunshine) is accessed about 20-30km from the city (maybe closer). So much beauty in the Banff/ Jasper areas. Happy Trails 😊",2018-03-27 06:45:54

You’ll find when it’s not hazy and partly cloudy, a photographer can use a polarizing filter, and/or fuji film, like Velvia or Provia to get the effect/colors of the original wallpaper.

Climate,location, color of the surroundings, geology also makes a difference. Too. I was recent visiting Cali on a road trip, and the colour of my landscape in the desert was similar to OPs shot, there are things that can change how the camera registers the color of the sky. Both are 👍 Tho!",2019-07-10 03:56:27

hizib7,"Bjork is my favorite singer and I would love to go to Reykjavik one day in hopes of running into her 😂😂  I'd literally dieeeee OMG. I went to a concert in the UK and was about arms length away from her. When it got quiet on the stage I yelled out ""YOU BETTER SING B!!"" and she smiled and at me and chuckled a bit. (I freaked of course.) Later that day, I walked to where she performed my favorite concert at the Royal Opera House and ended up meeting two of her choir singers by accident, who actually remembered my shirt and colorful sweater from being in the audience. Got some pics and told them to tell B I love her lol. Then I stumbled onto a big festival in a park where I met another one of B's choir singers and her bf. It was one of the best trips that I've taken. I went by myself (from North Philly 💚), and have so many great memories, now I want to make some in Iceland.  I know it's a fat chance that I'll meet her, but a girl can dream lol",2020-07-01 11:18:20

lv9g93,"Some of my favorite photography sessions happen unexpectedly. In other words, it’s not the “destination” composition I had in mind when I set out that evening to capture images. The photo seen above is a result of just this. My wife and I set aside a good portion of the afternoon to photograph some of Colorado’s beautiful autumn colors along the Peak-to-Peak Highway. By sunset, we had found ourself close to Brainard Lake Recreation Area, and decided to check out some of the smaller lakes nearby. While the aspen trees weren’t as plentiful as we had hoped, there was no shortage of beautiful autumn colors in the grass and shrubbery. In addition, we were treated with a beautiful display up above and still reflections down below, making for a well balanced composition. Thanks for looking 😊

lv9g93,"No camera produces a real, unaltered image. And that’s also extremely bad taste to ask a photographer in general. You’re being downvoted for that naive, uninformed comment. 

Go read up on how photography and cameras work, and the history of post-processing. Then go start or follow a subreddit for SOOC raws or jpegs if that’s what you want. I guarantee you will find out quickly that cameras, even single-exposed as correctly as possible, do a very shitty job of capturing dynamic natural light scenes, and always have.

In Fall '15 we went to Sonoma and Napa Valleys and had a blast! We stayed in Rhonert Park (? I think that was the name of the town.) My first time to CA. 
We did the - spa day in Calistoga the afternoon /evening we arrived. Did the winery and vineyard tour thing the next day. 
Next day we went hiking at the Armstrong Redwoods followed by driving to Jenner so I could see the Pacific for the first time. Dipped my feet in...brrrr! And, damn, that coastline there doesn't fuck around. Crashing waves, etc. It was majestic. Drove down that coastal highway (1?) just a little bit, to Bodega Bay and then back up to Jenner. Ate dinner watching the sunset at a nice restaurant right on the edge of the water. Gorgeous. 
Next day we drove down to SF and did the Golden Gate thing- drove up the hill overlooking it, then drove over it. Did Alcatraz (I've wanted to go there since foreverrrrr), walked around those piers. Ate a fancy dinner down there. That night we stayed at a beautiful, historic, boutique hotel. 
Next day we explored a little more, we both got our first tattoos (!! 😁) then flew home late afternoon. 
(Sorry for the long reply- it was a memorable trip and we loved every minute. BFF of 25 years and I are pretty much sisters and we have a ball wherever we go.) ☺️ ",2017-05-21 16:42:13

Granted I have no Idea was snuggled up with me at night where I cowboy camped. 

My philosophy is that as long as the critters that snuggle up with me when I’m sleeping are gone before I wake up. I’m fine. What I don’t know won’t hurt me right? 🤷‍♂️",2018-12-17 17:31:46

I also lived in Portland for 3 years and took trips to the Oregon cost at least 3 times a month in the summer. So Im pretty sure I can weigh in on this 😂, and yes as others mentioned, Cannon Beach during a heat wave in the Willamette valley or on a holiday weekend is very crowded. There are people everywhere.

90oyx6,"I just got back from Iceland. It’s gorgeous but soooo expensive. 
-If you have a standard for quality of coffee, I highly recommend you bring your own. 
-I recommend shopping at Krónan or Netto grocery stores. Bónus is the most well known budget grocery, but they have a very limited selection. 
-Bring powdered laundry soap & TP if you have room in luggage. Sure you can buy it there, but again it’s $$.
- Most camp sites have good (but messy) showers. Some charge for showers. Don’t forget shower shoes. 
- Myvatn hot springs is way better than the popular Blue Lagoon. It’s smaller, but less crowded & cheaper. 
- You have to shower before entering baths. This means showering naked in front of strangers in a shared space. That can be off putting for a lot of westerners. 
- We wish we could have spent more time in the Westfjords & Katla Geopark (south side of the island). Just really gorgeous. Stay out of Reykjavík as much as possible. It’s just another city & not a big one in comparison to most major cities. 
- GuidetoIceland.is is a really good site with lots of info & lesser known spots. Hope you have fun 😀!",2018-07-22 01:13:45

She goes to country music gigs (which I don't) and I play computer games or CCGs with a mate when she's at them.

The other thing missing from this list is don't have kids (we don't). Nothing will drain your freedom, time and wallet faster than having that responsibility. If you do it, it becomes your number one ""hobby"" by a long way.

Even with tourists it has the lowest population density in Europe. By a huge margin. But there much larger and much lonelier areas all around the globe. Greenland. Sakhalin. Siberia. Sahara. Antarctica. Iceland is not ""the last magic place on Earth"".

If you do go (which I recommend you do) they have some crazy multicoloured hills and mountains in the north. Look up Purmamarca and serrania de hornocal 👍",2018-03-04 20:11:21

The bed and breakfast scene is awesome, lots of lovely places to stay and eat great home cooked breakfast. I think also Asheville was one of, if not *the* first cities to decriminalize marijuana possession long before it was legalized fully elsewhere, so a very liberal hippy kind of place. Check out The Biltmore mansion for an amazing piece of local history, and the largest home in America until recent when one of those billionaires decided they had to set a new record. There is also a lot of musical connection between Appalachia bluegrass and Irish folk music, so be sure to check some of that out if you enjoy folk music 😊",2021-07-07 04:39:08

m27twr,"Yes sir! The reason for the location shift is the orientation of the North Star which is needed to orient a tracking device.  The North Star isn’t visible at glacier point because of the ridge your on.  It is a natural orientation though you’ll notice panoramic distortion and the space between El Capitan and the tree on the far right appears smaller to aid the composition.  You can catch this alignment from late April to I believe even early June, I’m not the first to photograph it actually.  I took this foreground pano in the day in 2016 and later discovered this alignment was possible from a few other photographers images 😁",2021-03-11 02:41:12

Lake Irwin has got to be one of the prettiest campgrounds I’ve ever stayed at, and this is especially true during wild flower season. This composition was taken near Irwin lodge from a spot I had scouted out the evening before, and overlooks the valley and lake seen below. The actually campground is in that forest of trees to the right side of the image. Fun fact, this image is from the 2nd of 4 sunrise shoots I did at this location during my stay here. I wanted to get the best conditions possible, and I’d say this one isn’t too shabby.

I stand with all our Service Men & Women that have served and are serving, before BLM & COVID, all you heard on the news was Service Men & Women getting killed oversees, then it was Cops killing unjustly, I’m not saying they were or they weren’t killing unjustly, check the facts, I’m quoting the media & that’s what started BLM, I believe if you are a Citizen of the US or a visitor to the US Legally and you abide by the rules set forth to all then your life matters. Now we have this pandemic that's killing people and spreading like wildfire 🔥, people we shouldn’t have to be told to stay in and only visit within your bubble, wear your mask, we should have enough common sense for ourselves, our loved ones, our friends & for others to take the right precautions to protect them. 
Sorry to have gotten away from commenting about the beautiful Asters, but if everyone would stop and look at this pic for a minute, think about it being isolated & protected that's how it was able to become this lovely for now that's what we all need to do; isolate & protect so that we can fight this Pandemic.

zn2nl1,"Too many suggestions on Oahu to list… pro tip: spend the one of the first days there on a circle island bus tour, one that is guided by an islander who will clue you in to the best non-touristy local places to see and events… farmers markets, street fairs etc. If you stay in Waikiki like we did, be prepared for mobs of tourists Thursday thru Sunday every week no matter the month.

To get around the island: use the public bus, it was like $1.50 to go anywhere on the island (if staying more than a few days you can buy a monthly bus pass at any ABC store-which are on every corner). The bus routes and schedules are posted online on Google maps is amazingly accurate for finding the right bus where and whenever you are looking to go anywhere. Renting a car is very expensive, and public parking is nearly impossible to find ( and very expensive as well). Uber is also very expensive.

And always respect the nature and beauty of the islands and their natural resources (look for and only use reef safe sunblock if swimming in the ocean, and plan on taking everything you bring to or buy on the islands back home with you).

zn2nl1,"One of the most miserable experiences of my life 😂 I whole heartedly can’t recommend this to anyone unless you’re way more prepared than me and enjoy sweating like crazy. We got almost to the top and there’s that staircase that looks like a wall. I turned around and told my husband that I didn’t care if there was one million dollars waiting just for me at the top of that staircase. I wasn’t going. And we just went back down. The dole whip I had at the bottom was the best part of that experience. (Full disclosure, I actively disliked most things about oahu and I wasn’t in a great mood because I was having a bad time on a hawaii and no one wants to have a bad time in paradise. Also I wanted to get there at 6am but my husband took too long getting ready so we got there at 7:30 and there was no parking to be found. We had to walk over a mile just to get to the bottom of the hike.)
Anyway, the next day we went snorkeling at Electric Beach and it was one of the best experiences of my whole life so it all worked out.",2022-12-16 13:05:46

It was around 70 degrees for two of the days I was there - PERFECT weather for me to explore such a lovely place.

Lol, southwest Germany is probably just weird looking to ppl used to North American forests, where one might have to shoo off Bear, Wolf, Moose, Mountain Lions...oh shit boys we got a list goin.  The black forest really is devoid of large life though mate, it adds to the eerie.  New World > Old World when it comes to wildlife that, well actually still have limbs and shit frankly.  🤔

It's biodiverse too, I'm just saying it can look empty compared to home.  I'm in Iceland right this sec but yeah a North American forests you'll see far more, and far larger animals than in Germany.

6xkzym,"I stayed one night in Sorong and two nights in Raja Ampat. Since I stayed in hotel and resort, I spent about 12-13 million Rupiah including flights back to back Jakarta-Sorong. You can get it cheaper if you stay in a local's house (homestay). It all depends on how you spent it, I think you can spend less than eight million Rupiah.

reiiyk,":)  Do you know if it's going to be possible to see it again and what dates?   I guess it depends on where you're based (England for me), but I heard it might appear in the evenings roughly looking west around the 15th, but not sure how long for...

I have actually photographed it already, but only had clear skies when it was high in the sky and would love it with some landscape in (plus a gigantic meteor would be nice! 😆).

reiiyk,It's not possible to do that with any analytical tools I have.  Best data I get is from Facebook and their analytics suck.  That said I think it's just a small preference for non watermarked images.  Maybe people feel more comfortable sharing them since they aren't as worried about ownership.  Maybe it's an underdog/amateur preference effect.  I don't know...I just think I've seen the pattern pretty strongly and have decided not to fight it.  Let the pictures be seen.  😊,2021-12-12 18:33:58

It would be a big explosion, and possibly cause global cooling..but not to the degree the Toba one did 74,000 years ago (causing global winter— according to the data the USGS showed). 

It would cause a lot of havoc, yes. Affect the whole world? Very unlikely. Affect most of the US west/mid-west/mid-east region? Most definitely.

8ai046,"Last year this happened also. Yosemite got a bunch of snow, then a big rainstorm came in and was threatening to flood us with a bunch of snowmelt. In January last year the park was closed for a few days, everyone including employees were evacuated. We were sent from our homes to go stay in Red Cross emergency shelters for a few days. This was shot last January shortly after we returned to the park. 

Currently, we are in a heavy rainstorm. They say the snow line is at 10,000ft, so this should wash down alot of the snow that's up in the high country. The Merced River is supposed to get over 15ft and should peak around 2pm. I'll try to get a shot for you guys, luckily they didn't evacuate employees this time. 😏

In this shot I am standing on the curb that runs along the Ahwahnee Meadow. The bike path is flooded, along with the meadow. Going down to Curry you have to wait at this spot, let traffic pass, then run up the one open lane to dry ground. Last year was insane with water.

I am a local here! I have been living and working in Yosemite Valley for almost 5 years now!

I only took 2 semesters of German because I’m an opera singer and visited because I had a friend who lived in München. I never encountered the phrase outside of WW2 references. Europeans may have a different idea of what it means to them, so I’d ask them. I can say my French husband finds it funny. He’s never been to Germany and doesn’t know any Germans, and when he says it it kind of mildly irritates me for some reason🤷🏼‍♀️",2019-01-21 15:19:14

That alone makes a giant visual difference in how one (eye OR camera) would interpret a scene. Just think that’s worth mentioning. You present this image like its apples to apples, but it’s not. Food for thought. 👍🏻",2018-09-06 07:46:26

m3gyry,"You are looking at a photograph that will most likely never be taken again at this location. Why am I saying this? Well let me explain myself! The tall flowering plants seen in the foreground, often called Monument Plants, spend anywhere from 22-80 years growing very close to the ground (no taller than a foot!). They flowers once and then they die. During the flowering event, the plant can grow up to six feet from its shrub-like stage! In addition, it becomes populated with dozens of beautiful light green/white flowers. It really is quite the sight to see. During our visit to Crested Butte this last July, we were told by some of the local wildflower experts that this year’s Monument Plant blooming event was on a scale unlike that seen in over 70 years! They were blooming everywhere!

112cb0m,"I seriously do not condone this and I understand that what I did was wrong and dangerous, might get downvoted to hell, but I'm gonna share anyway

There is a hike in my province that's been blowing up like crazy with instagrammers over the past few years (Joffrey Lake) because not only does it have some of the most beautiful views in our province's hikes but it's also fairly accessible (only 2hrs hike) and only a 1-2hr drive from a popular tourist ski village (Whistler). 

I mean, they have built THREE big parking lots just to *try* to support the demand of tourists visiting this poor place. 

During the peak of COVID, a lot of our hikes were put on a free reservation system to control overcrowding. But this place, Joffrey, they just *shut it down* for a good long time because I'm assuming even with daily reservations (which for other hikes have booked within 2mins of opening) it would be hard to control the population. So they just completely shut it down, blocked off the parking lots and put a very weak blockade at the entrance.

I had never done the hike though I had done a couple of the others in my province, and while I really did want to do the hike, I didn't want it to be with 1million instagrammers (I myself don't have Instagram or other social media; I just wanted to do the hike for the beauty of the place). 

So.....I convinced my very hesitant dad and my 2 cousins to break into the park, lol. My dad parked a decent distance at another non related site, we hiked up, only came across 2 others who coming down and they told us there was only 1 person up there (who we never ended up seeing. Kind of creepy but 🤷‍♀️).

And my goodness, it was probably the thing in my life that I am most fortunate for because such a thing will likely never happen again, I'll never have that opportunity again. And yes the hike was incredibly breathtaking, made more so by the emptiness and solitude, and my gratitude for being able to do it under these conditions

A few weeks prior, I had gone on another popular hike (though this one is less accessible as it's 4-6+hrs each way) (Garibaldi lake), and this one was on a strictly controlled reservation system (took me 3 days to get 2 tickets), so while the population was controlled it was still quite crowded, I mean, enough to annoy my introverted ass, and as beautiful as the hike was, it was just ruined by the more-than-a-few people walking alongside the lake. It just made me all the more grateful for being able to hike Joffrey with no other visitors. A once in a million experience that I can only wish for",2023-02-15 03:07:07

I’ll take months dry subzero over months of 95 degrees 95% humidity a million times over. I *love* it up here. Plus, mountains. 

I tell you what though, even the Texas coast can’t compare to NOLA humidity. Holy moly. I was there in April and October and can’t begin to imagine the summers. You could practically watch the mildew growing on the walls. 

But it’s a wonderful city. One of the very few that lives up to its reputation. I couldn’t live in all that busyness, but I can’t wait to go back for another visit.",2020-10-26 07:46:51
jhy8vy,"Nola gets soupy af. It really feels like you’re swimming when you’re walking around there. But that city is amazing. Moving away from it made me realize there’s not many places like it. Just a constant party and food fest 😌

I’d love to live in Montana though. I’ve always wanted to live in the mountains. Even here there’s the slightest elevation and I think it’s the coolest thing lol",2020-10-27 01:24:57

j3m5ha,"STOP SHOWING GTA’ers WHAT HAMILTON REALLY LOOKS LIKE!!!

Just kidding, but really GTA’ers, we love to have you, just please don’t act like f@#k-wads when you’re here.

Be courteous in your driving and parking, pick up your trash, please don’t use offensive language when you’re out - there’s families with children around you, etc.

If you do that ..... then maybe the idiots among us in Hamilton will learn from your example!

Have a great day!!
