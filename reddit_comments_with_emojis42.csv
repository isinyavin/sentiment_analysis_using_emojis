z3yc71,"I love that this is the vibe Metal still hangs onto, despite being one of the most gatekeeping genres, having an insane amount of alt-right leaning subgenres and then of course people like Varg Vikernes. Fucking le wholesome though. I'm glad we're on Reddit at least, where comments like this would be in equal equivalency on a post about a hip hop or country post (Or pop, or edm, or latin, or k-pop, or R&B...)

What amazing humanism that this famous artist showed manners in a misunderstanding that was largely his fault. Metal fingers up 🤘",2022-11-25 03:04:59

10lcvuy,"100% props to the trainer for being super compassionate and energetic yet also recognizing his buddy’s limits. But also, kudos to this guy, recognizing a change he wants to make in his life, and then putting it into action. That’s harder than most people realize and he deserves all the respect for it.

I don’t think anything bad or good of fat people in the gym, but I respect the hell out of fat people I’ve seen at the gym more than once. Because I’m the chubby guy who’s still too lazy to actually work out and only goes to the gym to play racquetball 😂",2023-01-26 22:34:11

10lcvuy,"Maybe I'm crazy. I honestly think people are afraid more of how people will react to them at the gym rather than reality. 

Other than the ""oooyeah"" bros and the ""I gotta look pretty at the gym"" chicks. (And that's just a heavy generalization)

This kind of thing in the video isn't common, but no one is truly judging you for trying. 

The majority of people there want you to succeed. Just do you.

Shit people don't matter. 👍",2023-01-26 10:29:37

10lcvuy,"Tbh doing things that are too strenuous when someone is this overweight can be dangerous. The heart is already so overburdened, and it's the same regarding running etc for cardio due to so much weight on the joints etc, as well as heart issues.
Larger or v unfit people should be doing things that aren't that taxing, so def not that tire.

He was benching 165lbs and he had me start at 75lbs (two 15lb plates plus 45lb bar). 9months later im able to go on my own and now bench 125. He told me to focus on technique and injury prevention and to not worry about the weight so much. Each time i go i try to push myself and i hope i can catch up or even pass him someday 😭😭😭",2023-01-26 00:44:46

10lcvuy,This made me so emotional! It reminded me of when I was 20 and I started going to the gym for the first time. I had a great personal trainer and then later I became a trainer because I wanted to help people too. It really is a gift to be able to have the endurance to be able to lift weights and be physically fit. I don't ever want to take for granted my ability to stay in shape because I remember being right where this guy is. 🙏,2023-01-26 02:52:34

10lcvuy,"This guy is awesome. 


For anyone trying to get fit just know this. It NEVER gets easy. Easy doesn’t exist in wt lifting. 

You can just do MORE of the hard stuff. 

When I started lifting weights I could not bench 135 pounds. Years later I could do 365x3 (heaviest I ever benched, never maxed). 

135 still always felt like 135. 225 always felt heavy. I could just bench them a whole lot more times. 😀

I started again after years out of the gym and it is so much easier to stay motivated because I learned there is no easy when it comes to working out.",2023-01-26 04:46:25

10lcvuy,"Yeah but this guys journey is going to be so much deeper than mine 😅 I feel bad comparing myself when he's putting in a lot more work (especially with those exercises -- even I'd have trouble with those). Dudes going to be *cut*.     
   
*Thank you so much* tho! It really is worth it. I feel better, I move around quicker, I get less winded and I think I look more stylish, too? Depending on your size, you might not need a whole lot of exercise. It just depends on the tone you're going for, the amount of weight you plan on losing over time?  
  
To anyone thinking about losing: *do it*.    
   
ngl the first week or two are the hardest. For me it was being hungry for the ramen & two litres I used to guzzle all day. I had a problem lol. I was eating an easy 5000cal per day (which dropped to a healthier 2000cal). After you get into cutting, your body gets used to it and you fall into a new routine. The *process alone* will make you *feel* healthier. Can't recommend it enough!  
  
Just make sure to practice positivity. Being positive & showing my heart has helped alleviate the leftover self-esteem issues I had? Plus, people just feel good interacting with you, which in turn makes you feel good. It's a healthy cycle that's well worth the effort!   
  
And thank you again! It's really cool of you to acknowledge my weight loss like that 🙇🏼✨️",2023-01-26 17:21:07

10lcvuy,"Literally this .. for me it’s not that’s it’s annoying or anything to go , I think imo I’m just to depressed and getting to lazy bc of it and I feel like even if I didn’t wanna go, I feel like even just showing up their and sitting on a machine or going on the treadmill for like 15 mins is just as much as an accomplishment as going their to work out almost .. half the time once I get their and feel myself thinking about leaving even tho I just showed up I just start getting anxious that people are gonna think ,” he literally just got here and is already leaving ..” and tbh idky but that pushes me to just stay for about an hour at the gym to feel like I got something accomplished.. I just got so much depression and trauma in my life atm that for me it’s about the baby steps .. if it takes me a smaller more amount of time to get to where I want I’m okay with that .. as long as I got to where I want how I wanted to I’ll be absolutely fine 👍 😊",2023-02-17 08:18:31
10lcvuy,"To everything a season!

I was working out 4-6 days a week for a couple years, and then something knocked me off kilter.  I was down to 0-2x a week. I started to feel bad about it, afraid of losing progress. Then I tried a more compassionate approach. I told myself that I would only workout “out of joy.” That has really helped me holistically. Now if I want exercise out of shame or fear, I don’t go. I make myself invest in other good things like food and naps. After some much needed rest (more than I planned on), the joy and drive came back. I’m back to a regular schedule and making progress on strength goals.

That’s my long-winded way of saying, you’re alright! You are so deserving of compassion and understanding. And you are more than your performance. ❤️",2023-01-26 14:11:08

No it isn’t 🤡

>	It’s illogical to think that as soon as he gets home, the beer will miraculously be cold for enjoyment.

LMAO you have no clue where he lives and have no basis to say that it won’t be cold when he gets home.  He could be on the road next to his own property for all you know.

On top of that, he can slam it down warm or just pop it in the fridge.

>	Is he 30 minutes from home or longer? 

Probably not since he’s putzing around in a tractor that goes like 10 mph.

>	Did the people in the video know that he was almost home?

You’re the insane person inventing a fake scenario.   You tell me lol.",2022-08-10 19:52:33

uwvjzy,"Oh. Oh my. Have I got a video for all of you. But it’s on my phone - I’ll have to upload it to YouTube. Shit. 

I took care of my ailing grandfather through the final stages of his Alzheimer’s and dementia. It was.. sad. But there were some moments. Some very good, cathartic moments. We talked about marriage, life, business etc but late at night.. 2.. 3, 4 in the morning.. (And I was a 24 hr caretaker so stayed in his basement with my family) and I’d hear footsteps upstairs. Now, this is a man who wouldn’t get out of bed for two weeks at a time (except to bathe) sometimes. And all of a sudden, there he is. In his living room on the couch. Singing to my grandma (who’d passed in 2014). It was the sweetest. “Somewhere, over the rainbow…” but he’d add my grandmas name in there at all the right spots. ❤️ 

Tragic disease, and one for which I fear I’ll eventually succumb to myself. I’ve had 11+ concussions with tbi, migraines since I was 5, adhd, mental health issues always, and already having minor tremors in my hands (my dad has what are called “essential tremors” but it just looks like his mom’s Parkinson’s) so there’s that looming as well. 

Anyways, I digress. I’ll have to upload the videos to a new account though, dont want them connected to my page unless edited a bit.

Edit: Omg I just re-listened to one of the videos and he’s singing  “there is only so much time, in my life, and I can see that my time is running out..”",2022-05-25 04:37:13

I want to pull a Henry Rollins and just walk around asking people about themselves and find out what their days are like and if there's anything they like to do for fun and helping provide so it can happen and have fun with them.

1. Ouch.. it’s been a pretty hellish week in my world. Maybe I did read it wrong? Idk I’ve kind of given up on everything, reading comprehension too, apparently.

2. Why shouldn’t we discuss the government who has all their fingers in so many pies? They don’t necessarily represent their people (I’m British… trust me… Boris and all the other dickheads before him only represented themselves. But guess what? Everyone likes to shit on the English and how horrible we are and *more* than half of us don’t even fucking like the tories or the bullshit they’ve pulled over the last 12 years. The Americans had the same thing with Orange Face, I’m sure)

3. Don’t remember laughing about it? It’s pretty horrible stuff…

4. I mentioned it because I *fucking agree with you* 😂 except like I said, I don’t think it’s the people of *x* country that should be picked on; the fish stinks from the head. It’s not that deep, mate… there wasn’t any malicious intent there.

So tired of this shit. Fucking Afghans are falling from the sky and I literally do not have a single fuck to give anymore.

He got to know a guy, small talk etc. The guy always loaded his car up with materials. One day he asked him, if you ever sell this car let me know, I really want it. He told him when he buys a truck he can have it. The guy didn’t believe him tell the day came. He drove that car to Lowe’s and tossed him the keys. The guy almost shit a brick. The car was probably in the same price range. It wasn’t worth much, but they last forever. It’s always nice when you can pay things forward. It really restores people’s belief in humanity.

ao38em,"This makes me so happy. I actually did this once as well; had a 1996 Tercel that I used throughout high school and needed to get rid of. It was about 10 years old at that point, it just needed a few minor tweaks here and there, otherwise it ran great. It was literally just taking up space in our driveway. 

My husband at the time actually worked with a really good dude, an immigrant and super hard, dedicated worker with a wife and three kids, whose car just broke down. He couldn't afford to get a new one or fix his old, so he was walking 5 miles to work and back every day since there wasn't any available public transportation where they were. He also couldn't afford the bus fare, even if there was one available. 

My husband let me know about this guy, and without a second thought I said 'it's his.' He only paid a dollar for it (had to do with local car tax laws or something). I didn't even take the dollar, it was just for show. I'm so glad this kind of humanity still exists out there. 💕",2019-02-07 21:11:50

My car had broken down and the repairs on it was going to be more than I had paid for the car.  The family had a meeting about it and decided to just give me the car. I wanted to give them money but they refused.  They had just told me to pass it on.

I live in Charleston, SC and had a very similar situation happen with my 7 y/o and an older couples really nice classic Ferrari outside of The Charleston Place hotel. 

They took notice of my sons admiration and kindly let him see and sit on the inside and insisted we could take pictures or whatever. 

We weren’t being filmed by the couple, and we were a little more excited and eager than the folks in the video, perhaps because we didn’t have a camera in our face? 

So, I just think, it’s not super plausible to just assume this and everything like it is staged. Some people are just nice and like documenting everything.

10gv6s3,"Hijacking your high rated comment to tell my own squirrel story!

When I was 14, I was walking up my street and saw a crowd of people standing on the sidewalk/patio of a restaurant on the corner of my block. I went over to see what they were looking at, and it was a baby squirrel sitting on this one guys sneaker.

We were admiring how cute and friendly it was, when a kitchen employee came outside with a box and said “I’m gonna take care of this”. 

Now, I knew this guy to some degree, he was not the type to love and respect animals. He once stopped on a mouse right in front of me when I was very young and it scarred me for a long time. 

I immediately piped up, “I’ll take it!” I knew I couldn’t just leave it there and hope it’s mother returned for it, for fear of the same employee finding it again. It seemed old enough to survive on its own, so I walked it over to a local park and set him down on a tree branch. I said goodbye and turned around to walk away. 

Guess who climbed down the tree trunk, ran after me, scurried up my leg, and sat on my thigh looking up at me with the cutest little face. This happened about 3 more times. I couldn’t leave without him, he wouldn’t let me.

I brought him home and named him Waffle, and he lived with us, part-time in the house and part in our front yard. He would climb up my leg whenever he saw my and sit up on my shoulder and I’d pet him and feed him peanuts. Over time, he came inside less and less, and eventually I would just see him around my block here and there (his tail was a little stubby, so we could recognize him). 

I missed him, but I’m glad he got to return to his natural squirrelly life. He’s probably passed on as this was over 12 years ago. 

Rip Waffle ❤️",2023-01-20 16:53:23

I’ll never forget that labor of love, waking up overnight every so often to feed and stimulate them to go potty. Those orange formula poops still haunt my dreams 🤣 what a god awful smell. My newborn human was a breeze compared to them but I learned a good lesson in patience and compassion. Wouldn’t give it up for the world",2023-01-21 00:13:42

10gv6s3,"I found a lil bird with an injured wing once too, called several vets and said there was nothing they could do and call the (rehabilators?) in the area, only 3. All didn’t answer. So I followed the instructions I found online which were to keep it in a box in a dark place in the house for a few hours, with a warm water bottle to regulate it’s temperature. Set it free after a few hours and lil baby was still struggling a bit but I knew there was nothing else I could do unfortunately. She ended up surviving and I’d often see her hopping along my path whenever walking out of my apartment 🤍 <3",2023-01-21 02:50:47

q5qfzp,"My last fall mountain biking I didn't hit my helmet but the way it happened on the fastest downhill with me pumping a straight for speed and just flying, my friend following was clocking 45 mph and I threaded 2 trees and didn't see a small sapling beyond one of the larger, tapped my bar on it and bike twisted and went straight down and I tucked and rolled, skidded on my right shoulder a good distance and stopped short of running my head into a tree. 

Everyone was freaking out and my adrenaline was going, are you okay -E-Cross!?

hz1svj,"We used to have an old farm, and I did this with a turtle I found on the road in. As soon as I picked it up, it peed all over my feet. Not just a little bit. This was a big ass turtle. My feet were soaked in turtle piss. 

Pee feet or not, I'm glad I did it, and I'm glad this dude was there for this tortoise! 😊",2020-07-27 23:52:40
hz1svj,"Ok, I’m a zoo geek, but if you see a tortoise or turtle trying to cross a road and you want to help, pick it up by the sides of the shell like he did, but then put it on the side of the road in the direction it was headed.  They are often territorial, so if you remove to a different location it will not know where to find food or water, and you may unwittingly move it into another turtle’s territory.  Something like a box turtle lives it’s whole life in just a few hundred square yards.  Also, putting a big tortoise in your car like that can result in an unfortunate incident. You cannot IMAGINE how much pee a tortoise that size can hold, and their poop is extremely sticky and slimy.  Just FYI 😄",2020-07-28 01:36:22

eq6fcn,"Let’s use everyone’s favorite country to cite as the “best free healthcare CANADA 🇨🇦 btw it’s not “free” 


Alberta - Costs for are not disclosed on the government website.

British Columbia - Visitors and residents

$530 flat fee for ground service
$2,746 per hour for a helicopter ambulance
$7 per statute mile for an airplane ambulance
Manitoba - Costs are not disclosed on the government website.

Newfoundland & Labrador - Non-residents are charged on a “cost recovery basis” for air ambulance transport.

New Brunswick - Visitors and residents pay $650 for an ordinary ambulance and $6,500 for an air ambulance.

Northwest Territories - A government brochure warns that the average cost of an air ambulance from Yellowknife to Alberta’s capital city is $10,000. The patient could also be responsible for ground ambulance service, the cost of a nurse or physician for the flight, and the cost of travel home after discharged by the hospital.

Nova Scotia - Canadian visitors pay $711.60 for an ordinary ambulance, while non-Canadians and new Canadians pay $1,067.35. Costs for air ambulance are not disclosed on the government or the Emergency Health Services (EHS) LifeFlight website.

Nunavut - This northern territory warns out-of-province visitors that health care there can be very expensive, and an air ambulance evacuation could cost up to $40,000 depending on your location, the location of the nearest medevac plane, and the location of the nearest centre where treatment is available.

Ontario - Ontario charges $240 for land transport if you are a visitor from another province with a Canadian health card, or a resident without an Ontario card. The full cost of an air ambulance applies to visitors and residents without an Ontario health card, residents transported into Ontario, or for a reason that is not deemed medically necessary.

Prince Edward Island - Visitors and residents without a valid health card pay:

$600 for an ordinary ambulance within the province
$691.95 for a one-way trip to Moncton, NB
$1,080.50 for a one-way trip to Halifax NS, or Fredericton or St. John, NB 
Non-resident Canadians will be billed $12,000 for air-ambulance services, and non-Canadian visitors can expect a bill of $18,000.

Quebec - Quebec stands alone in offering a cheap way to fly on a stretcher—if you have the foresight to pay in advance. Residents and visitors may buy a type of membership card directly from the local company Airmedic. The annual membership fee rose to $120 per person ($250 per family) in early 2013. Policyholders of vehicle insurer La Capitale General Insurance could pay only $45 per person. “We also have coverage for tourists or residents who travel to remote areas,” says Jolyane Pronovost, director of public relations for Airmedic. “For seven days, the cost is $25.”

Saskatchewan - Depending on a resident's location, they will pay from $245 to $325  for a basic call pick-up. Rural residents also pay a fee of $2.30 per kilometre for transfers into larger centres; however senior residents are expected to pay no more than $275. Costs for visitors are not disclosed on the government website.

Yukon - Yukon’s Ministry of Health and Social Services covers medical travel services for residents requiring certain services—but not visitors. The potential cost to visitors is not discussed on the ministry’s website.",2020-01-18 00:59:36

mf7eat,"Nanny speaking - TL;DR the best way to deal with why questions is to ask them ""why do YOU think ____?"" If they say they don't know, prompt them a little (see below), and then turn it into a conversation. :)

""Why"" is usually asked as a catch-all and can be a disguise for deeper questions they don't have the words for (or, sometimes, the courage to ask). ""Why are we changing our schedule? Why is this event occurring? Am I in trouble/are you mad at me? Why does this happen - is it because of me? What does all this mean? I can't figure out how these things can possibly connect and it bugs me that it seems to come easily to you - could you please help me grasp some of the more intricate concepts? I don't quite understand what you just said and some of it is too complicated - could you repeat yourself and make some parts a little easier for me? Is there something wrong with you/me/other people involved?"" - all possible things that would totally bother a young person that they wouldn't have the capacity to ask, other than by saying, ""Why?"" 

Pro tip - to make sure you don't sound condescending, make sure you actually want to hear what they have to say. If you say, ""well what do *you* think"" because to you the answer is obvious, you're going to, rightfully, come across as a prick. If you're not actually curious but want to talk to them anyway, fake it till you make it - pretend like what they say will really give you a great insight into what they think and feel, because that's the truth. They'll tell you a lot without telling you much, just by the words they use and how they use them. If you are actually curious about what they think and they come back with a shy, ""I dunno,"" that's where prompting them helps.

Ask them *other* questions about the situation. Ask them what they think about related topics, or what they think somebody else might say. Perhaps it's in relation to a trip somewhere - ask them what they might see on the trip, or what they wish they could do while they're on the trip. Maybe somebody they know is hurt and can't come see them soon. Ask them what they'd like to do in that person's absence, or what they'd like to do when that person CAN come over. Or it's time for food and it's already been decided what dinner will be. Maybe they're hopeful for something else and can help plan and/or cook some meals for tomorrow. Ask them about that.

Finally, for the naughty little cherubs who like to respond with ""you're the adult, that's why I asked you"" or something similar - smile, even if it makes you grumpy when they say this. Resist the urge to roll your eyes ☺️ Smile to yourself to make it okay - they're testing you and testing their boundaries. It's okay. Say something to them like, ""well, let's work on it together and find out, then!"" or ""Well, I was just curious about what you were thinking about. It's okay if you don't want to come up with some stuff right now. Maybe next time we can brainstorm together."" or ""How can we find some answers, then? Want to help me Google to find out? Cause I sure as heck have no clue about why they is the way it is!"" or ""Hmm. Well, then, I guess maybe it'll have to be a mystery! Sometimes figuring out your own answers is a better way to learn. Want me to help you find your own answers? We can start by (looking in a book/Googling/watching a video/asking a professional/reading an article/reading a scientific paper/asking questions online) and see what kind of info we can get from there!""

Obviously there are differences with kiddos of different ages, but teaching even the smallest ""Why-ers"" how to look for answers is a good way to lay a healthy foundation for discovery! You can also get some great insight into their thoughts and feelings AND they get a lot of opportunities to be creative if you ask them what they think and really mean it!",2021-03-28 22:57:14

mf7eat,"So so so happy to be of service!! ☺️☺️☺️

It can be absolutely mind-numbingly exhausting when they ""why"" you to death, especially on days when you're already over it and don't want to/can't take the time to make a whole ""thing"" about it. **It's okay to not do these things.** On the days when it's a little person asking you ""why"" incessantly and you just cannot get them to stop, redirection is key!! Distract them, give them a job, on those really really tough days when you're really feeling like you're losing it, give them a ""shiny"" (phone, iPad, special toy, educational TV show) to give yourself a time out to recollect yourself. Grown-ups need timeouts, too!

I found it worked a lot to do my above techniques on very small kids (2, 3, 4 years old) as often as I could to really get them in the habits of creative thought, problem-solving, and self sufficiency (figuring shit out for themselves LOL). The more ""in the habit"" your kiddo is about a certain thing, the more likely you'll be able to tell them, ""hey, remember that book you have about ____? Why not check there first?"" and have them actually be satisfied with finding their own answers. Plus, reading books is a GREAT distraction! Some kids are less inclined to consider that a great alternative to pestering the grown-ups, which is why I don't always include it as a ""shiny,"" but once kids are reading or looking at an interesting/pretty book, if they're surrounded by others, they're more likely to start pulling them off the shelves and perusing them. Kids getting lost in books provides an excellent opportunity for grown-ups to have a time out :)",2021-03-29 00:51:39
mf7eat,"Try using a text therapy service! Sometimes its easier to write it out in a text first. And also your family won’t hear your conversations and you can keep it on the low until you feel more confident. I think the first thing I said to my therapist was “I’m straight up not having a good time” and we went from there. A great therapist will know how to direct the conversation and help you talk about it. You’re not sitting on a stage, it’s a conversation. It’s awkward at first but it gets easier. The first thing to do is just try. ❤️",2021-03-28 23:17:24

wvusmk,"This is a super well know poem, but I absolutely love it. It always gives me goosebumps when I read it, which is whenever I feel down thinking about my sweet girl. I always sense that that “feeling” I get when reading it is my sweet girl visiting me and telling me she’s ok and loves me. 

“Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.

When an animal dies who has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water, and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.

They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent, his eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.

You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together….

Author unknown”

iavm5h,"That classification is based on how much we think there should be - not how many there would be. I’m a wildlife biologist, I totally understand why we have that scale, but I personally believe it severely underestimates what a healthy population would consist of, especially when you introduce that much of that population is fragmented and confined to encroaching habitat destruction.

Edit: wow! I went outside to arrange our camping equipment and came back to this love. Thank you for also believing we can do more to help our companions on this Earth 🌏",2020-08-16 18:54:05

vxxoh0,When I was 15 I used to skate in my garage at night and my neighbors always complained about the noise. One night I saw their garage on fire while I was skating & saved their house and family in this exact way. They never complained about my skating again. 😅,2022-07-14 01:38:30

So he came and got me because he has bad eyesight. so I get outside and I look and there's what looks like smoke bellowing out of their house. The only thing was it wasn't smoke. We've just entered colder weather here, so it was actually steam not smoke coming from their dryer vent. 🤣 thankfully it wasn't what he thought.",2022-11-13 19:53:22

I screamed bloody murder and knocked on all the doors and windows and no one answered. I turned on their hose and put out the fire. A nurse answered the door. She had been asleep and probably worked nights. 

I don’t tell this story to pat myself on the back. But it is to say if you CAN do something, you have the responsibility to.",2022-11-15 00:36:37

ht13ty,"I was at the gym not long ago when a man who would have been AT LEAST 30-40 years older than me would not leave me alone. I am a very shy, awkward person and was doing my best to wrap up the conversation politely and give off cues to end the conversation... but he just kept hovering. It was getting to the point where I was incredibly uncomfortable and felt unsafe. This girl runs up to me out of nowhere and said something like, “hey if you guys are done here I need to use this rack”. This thankfully brought the end of the interaction and he left. The girl came back when he’d gone and apologised, saying she’d been watching the guy talking to me and decided enough was enough. I thanked her and we got back to what we were doing. My workout wrapped up and I wanted to go introduce myself to my saviour, but she’d left. I haven’t seen her since. 😭",2020-10-11 07:41:16

Was getting scarily harrassed and the dude at HT come over with a couple packs of gauges and was like ""Hey, sorry that took me so long, had to check the back. Are these the ones you were looking for? (etc.)"" And I rolled with it until the creeps left. And I *did* buy one of the gauge sets, then came back with a muffin for the dude cuz holy shit that could have gone really bad if he hadn't stepped in.

On the other side, one time the young HT gal was getting creeped on and I butted right in with ""Hi, sorry to interrupt but I'm having a hard time finding a specific backback I saw last time I was here (etc.)"" and she jumped right in ""Yeah np, let's see what I can do for you."" And I kept her ""busy"" until the creeps left.

Outside of HT I've also just helped out random gals who were obvs trying to escape creeps with the typical ""OMG HI! Haven't seen you since college! Wanna grab lunch and we can catch up?""

Like, everybody, please help women get away from creeps cuz creeps can go from annoying to life threatening in a terrifyingly short amount of time.

xz6zgr,"What i have found is that behind the decision to stay on meth, or heroin, is a memory from the past they want to forget. This memory is unbearable for them and the drug is their only way not to feel the pain from it. For instance, one smart guy i talked to said he was drunk driving and killed someone. And he cant live with it. Cant forgive himself. 

All pain, all suffering,  is resisting what is. We have to know we can surrender to the pain, face it, feel it, let it complete itself. Then your karma is oaid and you can move on. But to avoid the pain, not feel it, take a drug or something that removes the pain, then it will never go away cause you have not balanced the karma for your action. It will wait for you to be ready to feel it. Lifetime  after lifetime. So why not just face it. Feel it now, this lifetime, and be done? Thats all it takes. Surrender to your feeling. Sit with it, and watch it leave you, forever.

jvoh95,"I feel the pain of that. Literally worked 32 days straight. I had to endure coworkers whining about how they ""only"" had one day off or asking me why I was always tired 🤦‍♀️",2020-11-17 08:23:09

jvoh95,"I’ve lived in a car personally??  So I’m sorry if you don’t agree with my first hand knowledge, but I do know that falling asleep on the job is not because you can’t sleep in your car in 1 place, that’s a crack head.  You have to work hard to make something out of nothing. You can’t bare minimum anything when you’re in that position.
And crashing on the job isn’t because you live in a car, you can sleep in a car, It sounds like a user with an excuse👐40% of his income could have been taken as well.  If you live in a car and owe child support A 9-5 minimum wage job. Is not enough. You need to do more.  You tell me you can’t find anything, and I will know you’re not looking. That’s called lazy and you would not have the money to wake up and drive to a different location every 3 hours, then make it to work everyday and continue the night driving around, not all day for 2weeks Sorry not sorry. I know the struggle is real. But I also know some bullshit when I’ve been through it. Lazy is, what lazy brings.😂",2020-11-17 12:25:57

o5xx9s,"As a current foster parent, I cannot tell you how much this touched me. These kids need to have their own belongings. Imagine not just being removed from your home, but losing the ownership of all your possessions too. Not even having a stuffed animal or a book with you that is all your own. It’s trauma on top of trauma. By fulfilling their wishes, you are giving them more than you can possibly know. You are giving them the freedom to dream, to wish, and to hope, things that so many of them lose by being in the system. Thank you all so much for making their wishes come true!! 

Now as I dry my tears, I also feel led to provide you with information on how you can be a foster parent. There are not nearly enough of us to fill the gap. Is it hard? Absolutely. Is it the best thing I’ve ever done? Without a doubt. If you’re interested, you can contact Foster Care Navigators at https://www.fcnp.org/ They will help you get started on your journey.

Hi, UK biker here. 

Yes I legal, it's called filtering and most riders are told about it and even taught how to do it safely when in training; even if this is just a verbal lesson as they might not have the chance on the roads.

Also we have lanes in cities which are marked for buses only, about 10 years ago some of these lanes were marked for bicycles and motorcycles too. It reduces the sheer volume of traffic and helps the cities move better. 

Couldn't find the video I wanted, but this one shows a little how it can be safer: 
https://youtu.be/wSRY7RxMF1g . Filtering tends to mean you're not moving much faster than the traffic and always very alert. 

Finally all motorcyclists are very aware of the SMIDSY (Sorry Mate I Didn't See You!) and are taught extensively to be constantly aware of everyone else on the road and any action they May take. After a while you get a sense for when other drives may change Lane without indicating, learn to look through the glass of vehicles for pedestrians etc. 

Hope this helped 😊

yqliox,"Do these videos rub anyone else the wrong way? “I got bullied in school and no one would sit with me” seems like a made up story to try to get a reaction. I feel like zero viewer streamers are easy targets to work these made up lines into getting some reactionary content. Just harass enough low viewer streamers with these lines until you get some “wholesome responses” then add the emotional music from Up to it. 

It kind of reminds me of when YouTube creators were handing homeless people money and recording themselves doing it. Sure, the homeless person got some money and this guy is going to get a lot of viewers but the whole thing still feels kinda gross.

And then at the end “If u had one message for da world what would it be 🥺🎥” lmao come on",2022-11-10 08:35:59

yqliox,"Hey Grey. Im a fellow veteran, female. I’m with you on this. Also have PTSD and having been sexually assaulted repeatedly before and after I even knew and understood what sex was. I’m 37 now and finally realized I have PTSD, having therapists and friends tell me that I have sexual trauma took a while for me to realize and even made me angry at first (even though I already knew, just didn’t want to face it.) I’m at a point in my life where I’m facing the demons, it’s a process and it takes time. Its something we must live with forever. There has been too many scenarios that it’s hard to let go. It’s tough, severe abuse changes us.. I’ve given in so many times to people who wanted me sexually (even though I don’t want them) just to not be raped. Crying in silence and feeling guilt and shame right on after. I’m trying to understand it all. I wish there was someone who I can love and who can truly understand this part of me that could perhaps save me from it all but I know it’s just a dream. A dream I trusted so long ago before all this happened. Anyway, hoping and wishing the best for you. I’m with you. 💚",2022-11-10 10:33:33
yqliox,"It honestly has nothing to do with being a male or female. When someone is sexually abused, it’s extremely hard to open up about it. Maybe it’s easier for me now bc it’s the internet, even then I’ll probably end up deleting the post I just wrote, I avoid therapists just not to talk about it. I went mute after these traumas and told no one for so many years. Forget about telling anyone, I found it hard to just speak and would spent hours in a hot tub scrubbing myself with a Brillo pad bc of how dirty I felt. Blamed myself for so many years. Man, woman, it’s the same feeling. 💛",2022-11-10 10:36:32

qm0i8o,"Reminds me of Halloween this year: 


I put out mostly chocolates and very few fruit-flavored or hard candies in a large bowl because I didn't feel like camping by the door all evening. I'm fiddling with my phone as I was leaving the kitchen when I hear two kids outside. The younger one is thrilled at all the chocolate, but his older brother says to not take too much because it's for everyone. They younger brother replies, ""It's okay! I'm leaving some of mine!"" before they run off. I check the bowl when I'm sure they're gone and find a sandwich bag filled with hard candies, way more than the number of chocolates he would've taken. It actually made me a little happy as I dumped it into the candy bowl. 😌",2021-11-04 00:41:27

qm0i8o,I was at my best friends house the Halloween before Covid to hang with her and help her with the get together her son was having. The boys went out and came back waiting for pizza to arrive. She ran out of candy and went to the store and a bunch of young kids showed up at the house. Her son and six of his buddies (I think they were 12-13 because they were in seventh grade) were giving the younger kids the candy they had already got and talking to them and complimenting them on their costumes. When she got back I told her she owed them a lot of candy 😊,2021-11-04 21:05:06

Dude was waiting in the window like a creep to yell at us. 

Also he demanded to know my name, I gave him my neighbors name, and stuck to my guns when he questioned why a female looking kid was named ""Andrew"". Why are you watching kids from the dark and demanding to know where they live and what their names are bro? Get back inside and think about what restaurant you're stealing a stash of mints from tomorrow.

Even handing out candy I still give a handful to each kid. It's been 22 years. Fuck that guy. 

He doesn't live in that house anymore, but I still think ""fuck that guy"" whenever I drive by. 😂",2023-11-03 15:20:13

A group of 3 kids came up and took all of them (about 30 bags left), 1 kid around 12 years old was yelling at them about it. When the kids that stole the candy left, he dumped about a pound of candy from his own bucket; so that other trick or treaters could enjoy some.

If I'm home to hand out candy and it's getting late and I wanna be done with it, I start dumping handfuls of candy into the last kid's bags. Their excited 😲 faces are always the best, haha.",2023-11-02 15:05:26
17m3umu,"My son's such a goodie goodie, he wouldn't necessarily stop his friends, but he'd be like ""OK, I'll just wait here on the sidewalk, guys."" Also, so he'd have a headstart when an angry home owner opens the door, lol.

He's the kind of kid who only takes a single piece of candy, and when the adult says ""Oh, you can take more, hun!"", he might take two. 

He has a pretty stubborn sense of fairness, and he hates making or seeing people feel bad or sad. He's a bit of an overthinker and too empathetic for his own good at times.

For now. That all may change in middle school, when puberty hits and those hormones wreak havoc in his brain, haha. 😭",2023-11-02 17:15:41

r89l2m,"This is amazing! My teens BFF is scared of dogs. Attacked by a German Shepherd as a child. I understand. I was attacked by a pit bull when I was 17 and have a nasty scar down my face. I, too, was terrified of dogs after that. 
When this friend comes over I adore watching them gradually lose a touch of fear each time they pet our golden retriever. Sometimes my little yorkie gets a pat but that’s it and that’s bc he’s an asshat. I’m not sure this friend will ever be ready to meet our massive barrel chested girl but maybe one day. 💖 I’d so love for this guy to pet our golden. He’s really jumpy and hyper - and very young but very fun. If you’re scared of dogs just baby baby baby steps, if you’re interested.

r89l2m,A woman with pretty severe facial scarring once asked if she could bet my staffy and staffy mix after she’s seen a few other people petting them. I said yes and she was super nervous. She petted them and realised how nice they were and then thanked me for letting her pet them because she hadn’t pet any dogs since a staffy had torn up her face and she explained that my dogs were lovely and she was so happy that she could start to get over her fear of dogs because of mine and as they were the same breed that had hurt her in the first place but obviously they weren’t all bad. 🥺 definitely my favourite person who has ever asked to pet my dogs and I was so amazed at her bravery and courage after what the dog had done to her to actually pet the same breed that had attacked her in the first place.,2021-12-04 01:01:10

r89l2m,"Getting over a fear of dogs isn’t easy. Good for him for tackling it head on. I was terrified of dogs for years. I have no idea why, I just was. Maybe my autism made me scared of something as unpredictable as a dog, but really I’m not sure what I was scared of. It wasn’t until I got a cat when I was around 20 that I started to be less afraid. My cat completely acclimated me to being around an animal, and now, four years later, I’m not scared of dogs at all. I can go check the mail without worrying about a stray showing up. I can visit people’s houses without having to ask if they have a dog & if they can put it away before I get there. I actually feel excited when I see dogs out in public now, and it’s the most amazing thing in the world. My cat passed away unexpectedly on Christmas in 2019 and I miss him every single day, but I will never forget what he gave me. He changed my life forever, even if he was only here for a couple years. ❣️❣️❣️ So yeah, good job internet guy!! You got this!!!",2021-12-04 08:11:31

r89l2m,"When my son was in kindergarten we used to walk to school since it was on the next street down from us. So I would take my dog Rudy, a small poodle mix with a missing leg. Naturally all the kids would rush over to get a pet at Rudy and ask about his missing leg. There was one girl in particular who would ask questions from afar every morning. Then after a few weeks she would come closer and even after all the kids had moved along she would stay. After about a month or so she finally opened up to me about how when she was 4 (she was currently 7) a big dog mauled her face and body and that’s why she had these huge scars on her cheeks and mouth. Then a few days after she opened up it happened, she asked me if she could pet Rudy. I said of course! And she very carefully reached her hand out and pet Rudy, twice. Each day she would get closer and closer and would pet a bit more and more. By the end of the year, she would call his name and he would run right up to her, she would kneels down and fully embrace my dog with a hug. Her smile was so damn precious. She would say that she was missing a part of her face and Rudy was missing a whole leg, therefore they were perfect friends 🥺🥺😭😭",2021-12-04 04:56:25

So I started doing my own hair. Cutting, dying, the whole shebang. Now I’m going to go to cosmetology school for it. My dream is to work in a salon made to help people like us. Low stress environment, options to not speak, places to take a break, low lights if necessary, etc. There are people out there who understand and will help you, and there are people just like you.

she has the copyright. the publishers get a license to publish a certain amount of books in a certain number of editions. there are quite probably some clauses in the licensing contracts that don't allow for another edition with another publisher in a specific language & region for a specific time - but there definitely are no exclusivity clauses going beyond that, as different language versions are licensed by different publishers.

For example, for the english languages there were editions by: Bloomsbury Publishing (GBR, IRL, CAN, IND) Allen & Unwin (AUS/NZL), Raincoast Books (CAN), Jonathan Ball Publishers (ZAF), Scholastic Corporation (USA) and Arthur A. Levine Books (USA), that alone goes to show, that those clauses are not anywhere near 'she can't legally start making and distributing copies'.

I woke up at 5:30 to nurse my 14-month-old back to sleep. I knew then that mom was gone- she was in the room next to mine. At 6:00 once my daughter was asleep, I went out and asked my brother (on the couch) if he’d checked on Mom yet and he hadn’t. When I opened the door, she looked so incredibly peaceful, my first instinct was to shut the door quickly so as not to disturb her. She was on her right side with her right hand tucked under her cheek, and her left hand on her hip. Then it struck me that her whole body wasn’t heaving with the struggle of breathing. She was gone. I felt instant relief seeing her like that. 

She definitely didn’t want us in the room with her, I just worry that she was scared in her final moments. Her home hospice doctor is convinced that she never woke up from when I turned her at 2am.

If you are unable to get help while choking on something
 
It you place the back of a chair, up under your ribs, and repeatedly shove yourself forward on them, you can basically perform the same maneuver on yourself
 
In my case it dislodged the cap that I swallowed enough to actually swallow it 😅 but I went from being unable to breathe to breathing just fine
 
It was one of the scariest moments of my life though",2022-04-12 13:57:51

11kpinp,"Prior EMT here, this is so incredibly adorable but also really dangerous. In fact, we arrived on scene to this exact scenario my first year. Big sister went to grab the quarter out of her little brothers mouth and wound up actually pushing it further down into his throat where mom couldn’t get it out. 

YSK: 

ALWAYS make sure to make a “hook” ❓(<like that) with your finger and sweep the item out of the mouth by placing your finger into the mouth (enter to the side of the mouth) then with the tip of your finger protecting the airway from the object getting further pushed down, proceed to hook your finger around object and sweep the item out of the mouth. 

As a mother who had a 4yr old and 2yr old when our twins were born, I get it. Big brother saved the day no matter what, I just wanted to put that Info Into the comments just incase someone who didn’t know how to remove something from a child’s (or adults) mouth safely.",2023-04-15 02:39:01

Baby had the food dislodged in like 6 seconds. I was crying, the baby was crying, the little girl was crying because her nanny who she adored smacked the shit out of her baby brother. 

Of course once the mom came in she yelled “Mani hit the baby!!”  🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️",2023-03-07 08:58:00

I’ve heard those are quite effective! Many of my nanny friends ask that their families have those on hand. 

Honestly I get why your husband is so scared, even though I’ve had CPR and first aid training for over 10 years at that point it was so freaking scary. Instinct really just took over but I was a mess after. Couldn’t imagine with my own child.",2023-03-07 09:48:38

as1a4a,"I absolutely love stories like this, great job OP you made that families lives!!! 

I have a Similar story, like 10 years ago I was trading in some games of mine at the EB Games near me and while standing in line a younger kid was waiting behind me. Randomly his friend came in and he was so excited to tell his friend that he JUST got an Xbox 360 with the money he’d been saving from his paper route. They high fived and chatted and then the one behind me asked his friend what games he got for it. The friend said he wasn’t able to afford any games for it because literally everything he spent was just on the Xbox.

I had about 5 games in my hand, relatively new titles like Halo, Forza, and others. I turned around and without hesitation gave him all I had, granted it wasn’t a whole lot just the sheer joy that he experienced in that little moment was enough to put him through the roof. The kid was so pumped that without even saying anything at all he ran as fast as he could to his parents that were waiting for him outside in their vehicle to tell them 😂 was the funniest damn thing I ever witnessed. I walked outside and the parents asked him to thank me and I said not to worry I’m happy he gets to enjoy them! Then he high fived me 😂 

To this day I’ve never felt better in a single moment. This is often enough to lift me out of a bad mood of any kind.",2019-02-19 02:44:28

A couple of years later and I’m still rebuilding my confidence. But being able to make decisions without requiring permission or being criticised for it is one of the most amazing feelings ever. It’s only when you look back do you realise how incredibly **wrong** the situation was. 

Today I’m off to buy my first pair of Doc Martens, the black glitter ones. They’ll really go well with my unicorn hair. My kids are going to love it, the ex will probably call it pathetic. I no longer care what he thinks, but I care with every ounce of my soul that my kids know that they can be as weird as they want to be.

ycfy2c,"God this reminds me of around this time last year. Like a week or two before thanksgiving, I got home from work on a Saturday morning (I work overnights) and I had planned on going to sleep early instead of my normal like 1pm, but didn’t and was wrapping some presents in my living room. 

When I was doing that I could smell like a really intense campfire wood smell. My neighbor is always doing weird shit though so I assumed it was probably from him. When I finished I got up and looked out my front window and he wasn’t outside at all. Then I walked into my kitchen and saw smoke STREAMING out of the wall lmao 

Apparently my electrical box caught on fire, I grabbed a small kitchen fire extinguisher that’s like 40 years old and used that on the small fire. It put it out but damn it was…. quite a pathetic spray lol 

I remember when I ran inside to get the extinguisher I thought “should I call dad?” because every time something is wrong with the house I usually call him but then my brain just overrided it with “CALL 911 YOU FUCKING RETARD”

The fucked thing is that my electrical box was right above my gas meter, so if I had went to bed, and didn’t notice the fire, it wouldn’t had had to spread that far to just explode my house lol 

I was mad though because for months my lights had been flickering in the house, and I had an electrician come out and he was just like “oh that’s normal my house does that too” so I was just like 🤷‍♀️ the one that came to replace my burned meter looked at it and apparently some wires were stripped and that’s why it was flickering and it finally arced and lit the wood on fire 

SO THANKS EARLIER ELECTRICIAN that was an annoying as hell thanksgiving 

That’s what I get for putting my tree up before that holiday though",2022-10-25 05:14:18

Was canoeing on river, saw a lamb stuck down right on river level, a steep embankment above, it looked exhausted and it clearly didn’t have anywhere else to go. We paddled over and I used my paddle to help give it support to both shoo it in the right direction and something to brace off of and it kicked and pulled it’s way back up the steep drop and after some effort from both of us it reunited with its mum and flock.

v0ix6i,"Yeah! I was surprised when he got on the same ledge that the lamb didn’t jump off the cliff! It’s great that he was trusting. Maybe he’s been around people before? A shepherd? The little “baaas” were so cute but you could tell he was scared and I wonder how long he had been there. He could’ve been there 2 days and the parents were staying behind and couldn’t find him. Maybe they all came up the cliff and he got tired and got left behind? that would’ve been the saddest, if not strong enough to keep up or get to the top he would perish. Happy for the happy ending 😀",2022-05-30 13:45:10

f2ju30,"I was driving a friend of my son’s home in my big ole Buick Rendezvous back in early 2000’s. They were both nine at the time..laughing, joking around.
They were both happily sucking on Werthers Originals ( butterscotch flavoured hard candies). When I checked my rear view mirror on a turn I could see the little fella in the back was having trouble breathing. As I rounded the turn I instinctively turned towards him to ask if he was alright...turned steering wheel too far as I looked back in his direction..drove straight into cement bottomed telephone poll. Crash!The werther flew out of his mouth! He was no longer turning blue. yay! 
911 was called; whole nine yards: front of Buick smushed ; paramedics checking out little dude... he’s holding sticky Werthers in hand...” I was choking on this candy and it flew right out when we crashed” he told them: amazement in his little voice. 10,000$ damage to vehicle, but little life saved by original form of Heimlich maneuver.
Now if anyone is remotely making choking noises, I say, “ don’t make me have to take you out and drive into a telephone poll!😜",2020-02-12 07:42:42
f2ju30,"One of my twin nieces started to choke on a whole ass chicken nugget when she was about 3 years old. I was babysitting at the time and REALLY didn't want one of them dying on my watch, but I didn't know how to do the heimlich on a three year old. After a few moments she starts turning different colors and shit and I started panicking. I ended up reaching down her fucking throat to dislodge the chicken nugget. She starts coughing and drinking water. I ask her if she's okay, she tells me ""uh-huh""
Then... She does the funniest thing I've ever seen in my entire life. She takes the SAME, regurgitated chicken nugget off of the table and puts it back in her mouth to finish eating it. I have never cried so much in my entire life. This girl got me thinking she was about to fucking die to having me dying 😂",2020-02-12 13:13:44

It was very popular among students and school kids! 😂 😂,2019-08-17 08:37:34
cr3nre,"Brilliant 👍as far as I know. All the Nordic countries have offered refund on bottles and cans for decades.
This is taking it a little further. 
Hope we all follow suit.",2019-08-22 08:29:22
cr3nre,That’s sweet. In America we don’t have these recycling holders BUT we do have spikes on the ground outside buildings to prevent the homeless from sleeping there 🤷‍♂️,2019-08-16 12:15:30
cr3nre,"Same in Denmark. Those bottle holders are a good idea, I don't recall seeing them in Denmark.

Danish city planners, do you see this?! 🙂",2019-08-16 14:07:11

Det er uansett MYE enklere å lære norsk enn fransk, grammatikken er utrolig forenklet sammenlignet med fransk. Det største problemet er å uttale Haugesund 😅",2019-08-16 11:53:52

I’m sorry you’re so rude and instantly attack people for asking questions! Did you ever stop to think that maybe you’re a problem as well? Anyway I’m throwing my dice to tulsi gabbard because she sits more in the middle than the far right or the far left which is pretty much the only other options. Anyway have fun being rude to people when they ask you a question! But great job answering my question 😎,2019-09-11 19:49:31

zi10vj,"Green Bay native here. This shelter, Safe Haven Pet Sanctuary, specializes in sick and disabled cats that are in danger of euthanasia. They also have a neonatal unit for kittens. It is an absolutely amazing place and I donate to them every year on my birthday and the holidays. Please donate if you can! The cats deserve it.

Also, the video is wrong. Terry’s favorite cat is named Brownie, not Hopper. I’ve met Terry and Brownie before and they’re both amazing. I actually donated recently to sponsor her full adoption fee. Brownie has been searching for her forever home for years, so if it’s you, please go get her! She’s waited long enough. ♥️",2022-12-10 22:22:45

He’s got his own key to the building to nap when he pleases.🥰 Terry said “Imagine if every person who liked my posts donated just $5”.  The economy has been rough on us since 2020.

I just wanted to play with some dogs. Wouldn’t you know that the very first dog that hopped off the van to go into petsmart was the one my dad just *had* to have? 🤣

This fucker is 46 kilos and herds me to bed if he thinks I need a nap or I'm up too late and needs sleep. He whines and paces and annoys the shit out of me till I get up from what I'm doing then he trots off to the bedroom for cuddles and naps. Wtf I'm being mom'd by my own dog. 😆,2022-12-10 22:50:30

zi10vj,I think so. He keeps licking me ! Everywhere like he's grooming me or scent marking me lol. I work at a pub and we have a local who's there frequently and his dog is on the back steps waiting for him. His name is Wayne ow Wayno he's a sweetie and gets in my lap all the time. A friend of the owner came up and was like Wayno hows it going my man. I know the guy he's a sweetheart. Wayne sat up in my lap and snarled at the poor man. And nipped at him (not hard more so just chewed on his fingers for a sec in warning). He must be loyal to me because I share my steak. Cracked me up though. Then he didn't wanna go home with his owner either 🙄 😆,2022-12-11 00:02:01

aa5t3d,"As an aunt to two nephews and a niece of a very religious mother and father, this is my biggest fear. I’m pretty sure my sister in law would go batty and send whoever didn’t fall in line off to church all day, everyday. Luckily the rest of the family is sane so the only people who would get ostracized would be the bigots. Plus my mom would probably go slap her son if he ever stopped talking to any of her grandkids. 

I’m glad you have this awesome professor! Thankfully the world is opening their eyes more and understanding there are no rules to who you love. I hope your family soon remembers that love, too (if you want). ❤️ Enjoy your new year! 

PS. I’ll be your cool aunt if ya want.  Hopefully you like Hot Wheels and Spider-Man stickers!

I always told my kids 23 yr son 18 my baby girl Choose the path that you love because you’ll never get bored and be happier and do the best that you can do! My beautiful daughter at 12 came to us and said she might be gay and we were like oh OK. She just came to me and told me that she was bisexual and I said well do you have someone that you like right now and she started crying because “ I acted like it was totally normal” well it is her! She was bullied so so horribly that she had to quit school her junior year because the boys liked my daughter and she wasn’t interested in dating anyone at the time and they got online and told her to kill her self that no one likes her and so many other NASTY THINGS!! Threw rocks through our nine ft window shattering it,Major damage to our Escalade. That’s just material things what’s the worse and horrifying is my poor sweet girl attempted suicide.

i00y1p,Except the mating part 😔,2020-07-29 23:18:04
i00y1p,"> The average honey bee will actually make only one twelfth of a teaspoon of honey in its lifetime.

Actually, you're right.  Part of the problem is that the comment you noted is out of order in the list.  But mainly, we aren't told the average distance a bee will fly in it's lifetime, and can't figure that out from the information provided either - we're told the maximum distance they can fly in a single flight (which isn't the same as average distance flown per flight), and how fast they can go, but NOT how many flights they usually do in a day.  And average lifetime varies greatly on the time of year, but we're told nothing about population stats (I assume there are more bees in spring and summer but 🤷‍♀️) in order to be able to estimate the overall average lifetime distance flown to generate that 1/12th tsp of honey.  You need that info as well to get to the 'three times around the world to make a pound of honey' bit :-)  

So it's not that the bullet point info is unrelated, we're just missing a vital piece of information to show how they to came to that conclusion.  Just as your comment is missing an important piece of information - how much wood the car can transport overall in an average lifetime, and how far it travels in that average lifetime (oh, and how much wood is needed to build an average house).  Add in the pertinent information, and your comment makes sense :-)",2020-07-29 23:35:44
i00y1p,Yet the mass-hole bees have no problem going further into new england and annoying everyone with their shitty flying and always flying in the left lane.  And thats why everyone hates mass-hole bees.  And new york bees too.  🐝🌻,2020-07-29 18:12:45

My friend was in bed and looked particulally rough and horse.  He was so dehydrated.    I offered to go get him a drink of water from downstairs.   I made an ice cold pint of water.  There was condensation on the outside of the glass.  It looked beautiful.  Took it to my friend upstairs,  he couldnt take his eyes off it.  Walked around the bed and he was sitting up getting ready for his drink.   My firend was so thirsty!   He took the cold glass,  sat up and chugged that bitch.   After 3-4 second of glugging he spat it up and looked super angry.   I knew why too.   I'd poured him a straight pint of ice cold vodka.  😆😆😆",2022-05-08 07:37:20

About 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day for men. About 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for women. 

3.7 liters of water is 1 gallon and you drinking 3 gallons? Not that I have a problem with that, just never heard of such thing. Slow your roll bro. 

In severe cases, water intoxication can cause seizures, brain damage, a coma, and even death. Bottom line: Drinking too much water can increase the pressure inside the skull. This can cause various symptoms and, in severe cases, become fatal.",2022-05-08 07:12:07

Pro tip, grab a spray bottle for pot plants and just take the top with you into festivals/concerts. You can put them in a water bottle and the mist is incredible in a hot mosh pit. Ive literally had random people group up behind me just to get misted 😂",2022-05-08 10:01:29

pd6odm,"I had a house fire back on Oct. 28th 2014, lost absolutely everything, two dogs passed in the house fire but one was able to make it out the back door before it got too bad apparently and was in the backyard. Our neighbors who saw the fire (didn’t see it till there was 6 foot flames bursting out the upstairs and downstairs back doors) their son jumped the fence and saved our last dog (unfortunately she passed 10 days later) people like them, and I, and anyone else willing to put themselves in a slightly dangerous situation (he obviously made sure it was safe enough to be near the fire you gotta be smart in dangerous situations🙄)  so somebody’s LIFE can be saved, so a families home can not burn down with every single thing they own in there, if that home owner wasn’t in the backyard already spraying then he would’ve been SO lucky that this motorcyclist came by, that fire would’ve been to that house so quickly. After seeing my own home WOW it catches FAST. House fires are just really fucking scary terrible things that can ruin an entire family and it really warms my heart watching this.",2021-08-28 14:14:23

pd6odm,This guy is a HERO. He should be given a medal. So should all the firefighters 💜,2021-08-28 16:04:37
pd6odm,"Ex 911 dispatcher here. That moment when the lady took the hose and didn't really think it through... that's a VERY normal reaction when we're going through hysteria. When people happen upon a big incident or a powerful incident (ex. Seeing a baby get ran over) they experience levels of hysteria. Level 1 is like you stubbed your toe and it's bleeding. Level 5, the highest level, is when a mom sees her baby get turned into human spaghetti by a car. 

What we're seeing here is a bit of level 2. They're not thinking straight but someone who has a solid mind can control them and get them to do what they want. They can be brought back down with the help of othrrs. A level 5... well, nothing brings them back down except time (or a tranquilizer).

The biker guy did more help than we may think because he got others to use water quickly and gave them directions. Good on him 😎",2021-08-28 16:27:53

pd6odm,"Yeah lol. I thought the same thing! I am trying not to be too critical though because he DID help. Everyone was calm because while, yes a fire is alarming, the fire department was coming and it wasn't near the home. 
I'm assuming the home owner was smoking some weed 🤣, probably how the fire got so big.",2021-08-28 12:12:41

She was so kind and sweet, but also a sassy little asshole when she felt like it lmao. She didn't understand the world around her, she just wanted to be a part of it, and fully believed no harm could come to her.

Pretty unrelated but when my daughter turned 2, about 5 years ago, she wanted everyone at her birthday party to call her ""SpongeBob"" during the happy birthday song. My first thought was NO WAY but then I figured it would make her special day even more special. So I go around and tell all our guests that the birthday girl would like us to say ""happy birthday SpongeBob"" and when it was time for cake we all sang the happy birthday song and called her SpongeBob. It was hilarious 😂 and such a fun memory.",2022-06-08 15:56:20

Edit: maybe I have no friends because I can't tell the difference between a crow and a grackle. They seem to like me despite me constantly mis-speciesing them though 😎

Edit 2: Just took these pics

[Here's what I think looks like a crow?](https://i.imgur.com/SxXbm3C.jpg) Is that dude a crow, or a lovely lookin grackle? He's missing tail feathers and sort of reminds me of a chicken (no offense) 

[This guy is definitely a grackle](https://i.imgur.com/lltMvBC.jpg). If you look closely, he doesn't have a right foot. I call him Stubs. What can I say, life is rough in south Florida

d2robu,"It's a little less jaded if you read the paragraphs leading up to it, it's the last paragraph in the NewYorker story,

>“What’s really difficult for me is that I know he had a choice,” Susan says. “He chose to go back in there. I know he would never have left until everyone was safe, until his mission was accomplished. That was his nature. That was the man I loved. So I can understand why he went back. What I can’t understand is why I was left behind.”

>Dan Hill says that Susan will understand someday, as he does. “What she doesn’t understand is that she knew him for four or five years. She knew a sixty-two-year-old man with cancer. I knew him as a hundred-and-eighty-pound, six-foot-one piece of human machinery that would not quit, that did not know defeat, that would not back off one inch. In the middle of the greatest battle of Vietnam, he was singing to the troops, saying we’re going to rip them a new asshole, when everyone else was worrying about dying. If he had come out of that building and someone died who he hadn’t tried to save, he would have had to commit suicide.

>“I’ve tried to tell Susan this, in a way, but she’s not ready yet for the truth. In the next weeks or months, I’ll get her down here, and we’ll take a walk along the ocean, and I’ll explain these things. You see, for Rick Rescorla, this was a natural death. People like Rick, they don’t die old men. They aren’t destined for that and it isn’t right for them to do so. It just isn’t right, by God, for them to become feeble, old, and helpless sons of bitches. There are certain men born in this world, and they’re supposed to die setting an example for the rest of the weak bastards we’re surrounded with.”♦

ecb1hw,"I’m from Australia, and postage works like that here too except it goes to the post office for collection, you need to bring ID. They only leave it if you’ve given prior permission. When I ordered my sons new blanket sets off wish the delivery guy hid it between my garbage bin and my house (I have my bins right near the door cause lazy 😂). A package I received from my dad was delivered and hidden at the front of my car between the nose and the garage door it doesn’t make sense that they just leave boxes so out in the open like that. Not that it should matter. All porch pirates need to fall and break their leg like that one lady...",2019-12-18 12:29:40

15x8gsb,I was at the Disturbed show in Massachusetts on Friday night. He did a very similar thing with a group of fans in the front row. Talked about substance abuse and depression and how the music can help overcome it. Very powerful moment during an awesome show. 🤘,2023-08-21 17:46:13

15x8gsb,"I remember in the early days David would come out tied up in a straight jacket and they'd wheel him out on stage like he was a ""disturbed"" madman. It's fun to see how gracious and down to earth he really is. He's got all the swagger and magnetism of a preacher with none of the bullshit. I'm very glad he's open and honest about his mental health and that he found a way to hang on recently. He's the kind of ""spiritual"" leader so many people need to look to, because they see and know he's just like them. He sees them and acknowledges their pain because he feels it too. And if they could see how he could stay strong and find the light in his own darkness, maybe some of them could find their light too. It's amazing and surprising what type of guy he turned out to be some 20 odd years after I saw my first Disturbed show and just thought he was a crazy dude with a mean set of vocals! He's become one of the greatest frontmen in rock history!🤘",2023-08-22 17:10:06

carkjt,"I donated the right lobe of my liver to my brother 15 years ago on the eve of his 44th birthday.  He was a very healthy man who was blindsided by a rare liver disease (he didn’t drink). Luckily the liver regenerates, so a living donor is an option (albeit a dangerous one; the process is intense and invasive with a long recovery time for both the recipient and the donor, although the recipient has a more difficult and complicated recovery). If my brother had had to wait for a cadaver donor he wouldn’t have survived; the average wait for a cadaver liver 15 years ago was over 2 1/2 years. A living donor was his only hope and luckily I passed all of the donor tests. Because of my experience I advocate for organ donation and I’m very humbled by your decision to honor your loved one’s decision and her life by allowing her organs to be used to help save other’s lives. Thank you. My brother is alive and well today and thankfully, so far, has never rejected my liver within him. And now this young man is alive and well because of your family’s amazing strength and generosity in what was surely the darkest time of your lives.  This post made me cry for many reasons. Thank you for sharing this tender and bittersweet moment with us. Love and peace to you, your mom, and to the rest of your family. ❤️🌈",2019-07-09 02:30:10

I can't even imagine how emotionally devastating it must be to euthanize countless healthy animals because there are just too many to care for and they will basically starve to death otherwise. I don't know how any vet can do it for long. You would want to adopt them all, but that's obviously not feasible. So easily prevented by just staying/neutering, too 😭",2023-04-12 20:12:37

qqqxb6,"He wasn't doing the Heimlich Maneuver correctly,  should have clinched first under the boys abdomen with your other hand placed over top, push clinched fist in and up into abdomen, that will cause vomiting,  nowadays not recommended, due to internal damage caused,  they now suggest back thrusting, using open hand slap centre of back with an upward thrusting motion.
If your by yourself at home and you start choking, use the back of the chair, placed under your abdominal region pushing yourself down into the chair causing a Heimlich affect, to produce vomiting 🤢",2021-11-10 19:48:01
qqqxb6,Oh my god thank god for orange shirt guy. Every one just standing in the back ground particularly the fucking lady flailing her arms and grabbing her own throat FFS. Call the paramedics while this guy is trying to help him don’t just fucking stand there crying 😭 I advise anyone who loves anyone pls take a CPR and first aid class you will learn so fucking much and feel more prepared for emergencies it helps a lot with quick thinking and delegating for surprise situations like this so you don’t end up being  like the screaming lady in the back,2021-11-10 22:49:36
qqqxb6,I'm so glad that lady stopped to start screaming and freaking out next to them.  Without her undoubtedly high pitched wailing that kid would have surely died🙄,2021-11-10 13:40:54

qqqxb6,"My Dad saved my life when I was seven - laying in bed, sucking on a fireball. This was before the Heimlich maneuver. He picked me upside down by my ankles and slapped my back as hard as he could. It flew out against the wall. Then, he just went back and laid down like nothing had happened. ❤️",2021-11-10 12:20:34
qqqxb6,"Every time I see a video of someone choking and getting the heimlich tears spring into my eyes.  That poor kid. My brother once choked on a piece of carrot and after our mom tried it a couple of times while I watched from across the room, she screamed my name and switched to picking up the phone to call 911. I was shorter than him and weight about the same (young teens) and I very distinctly remember trying to do it twice, realizing I needed to calm down and place my thumb knuckle right below his sternum and POP out it came thank God. 

I think that experience is why whenever I've run into any kind of potential emergency time seems to slow down. It's like my brain says, panic after this is over lol. And omg I shake like a terrified deer afterward. 😄",2021-11-10 13:07:41

qqqxb6,Maybe they weren’t grateful and they wanted you to choke on the food as revenge 🤣,2021-11-10 12:41:37
qqqxb6,"I also want to add - when you use this maneuver (Heimlich ®™©) you are aiming to pick the choking victim UP OFF THE FLOOR via their diaphragm.

You HAVE to put your hands in the right place - at the navel - and you have to pull IN and pull UP - hard enough to yank them off the ground. If your hands are too high, such as in this video, you're pulling against the rib cage, which isn't very squishy. 

You want to shove all the squishy stuff, and ESPECIALLY the diaphragm, up towards their heads because that's what's going to pop the blockage up and out of their airway.",2021-11-10 17:22:01

A few years back after a long day a work, I came home hoping to enjoy some steak fingers and mashed potatoes… it was fairly late and me and my cousin were just joking and shit while I was eating , and just out of nowhere I was choking on my food. Dude tried his damn best, nearly crushing my ribs(dude is 6’3 and I’m roughly 5’4), somehow I’m death gripping my plate, he starts SCREAMING for my mom , she runs out half tiddy out in the night gown and just as my vision started to go out (literally was SECONDS from death) I started losing control of my body and dropped the dinner plate and was watching the family dog eat my dinner as I ya know was literally dying but mom came in clutch because she knew the right way to do the thang. it was weird asf, going from edge of death to reality. It felt like an eternity on the edge of death and in my last moments watching the dog eat my dinner off the floor so nonchalantly  would of been a terrible last sight / feeling 😂 afterwards, I had the little pink/red dots all over my face from busting blood vessels and my eyes for nearly a month looked like I smoked the most dankest weed to man non-stop. Was a whole look.",2021-11-10 14:14:36

I wanted to go to the ER, but he is very stubborn, let's just put it like that. I kept her awake and watched for any issues, just as you would for a possible concussion due to this fact. 

Now that I'm in nursing school he tends to listen to me a little more when it comes to these things. They aren't as thorough in cpr classes for expectant moms vs the certified CPR classes that you need for a medical profession- I learned that 2 years later🤦‍♀️",2021-11-10 13:27:23

I'm so sorry that is something you have to worry about.  That's a legitimate concern, unfortunately.  A mental health crisis should never ever ever be treated as criminal activity.  

That and the crazy costs of an ambulance and ED visit are additional reasons why we try to avoid calling emergency services. 

And I'm not sure how you're feeling about trying again, but consider calling your insurance provider and ask for a list of places you could go get an assessment.  Or even try to shop around on psychologytoday's therapist search engine just to dip your toes in the water.

The man who did the majority of it was a grouchy old marine who pretended he hated everybody, but in addition to helping around the yard, he’d often leave us a big bag of fresh produce he’d grown himself🥺 so while not the nicest guy I’d ever known, he was certainly one of the kindest.",2023-05-11 00:57:19

They also have this intriguing tendency to refer to immigrants as if they don't belong here. As if our entire country isn't based off of immigrants.

>We have been put in touch with several of the Good Samaritans. We are coordinating everyone’s schedules to get them together with the woman they rescued. We will let you know once it’s confirmed. Thank you. 💙

>If you watch any video in your feed today, make it this one. A group of Good Samaritans sprang into action on May 5 to help a woman who suffered a medical episode while driving on Woolbright Road. 
As her car slowly entered the intersection at Congress Avenue, her co-worker raced across the street waving her arms to get the attention of other motorists. Her co-worker was in another car and saw her slumped over the steering wheel. 
Several people got out of their cars and worked together to stop the moving car. One woman grabbed a dumbbell from her car and a man used it to smash the rear passenger’s side window. Another man then climbed through the window to unlock the passenger’s side door. The car was then put in park and the Good Samaritans pushed it to a nearby 7-Eleven parking lot where a nurse who was on the phone with 911 provided medical attention until the fire department arrives.",2022-05-11 22:58:28

My dad kept that phone on for over a year. I hope he listened to the messages i left for mom. It was a har time for me.

I’ve still got my grandads, aunts and uncles that have all passed saved in my phone as I can’t bare to delete them, even though my grandad died like 8 years ago. Deleting it seems so final and it’s like the last part of him I have. Same for my aunts and uncles. Sadly they’re all landline numbers so I can’t text them because if I could I would, I have so much I want to say to both my grandma (she died 16 years ago and I still miss her like absolute crazy- I’m tearing up just writing this) and grandpa but thinking it doesn’t seem to cut it.",2019-09-26 11:09:29

asbgxc,"I did this once, guy right along the highway, literally standing on the tire iron when the cars on this flimsy spare jack. Stopped had my pump jack in the back and a real tire iron not that crap one they give you with the car. Had the tire done lickityspit. He tried to give me money too but I refused. Found the twenty he stuffed into the jack handle like 3 weeks later 😂😂

It's the little things, glad there's others that still do this.

The owners of his parents' accommodation saw the state of the bicycle and the wife using her decent knowledge of English told us her husband wanted to fix the bike. He put a whole new tire on the bike and didn't want anything to repay. So kind ☺️",2019-02-20 09:48:32

asbgxc,It's good those guys were there and were kind enough to help. Even when you know what's up its good to have people there for support or to bail you out in case something goes wrong. I've experienced way too many of them and even though I know how to do it it's still frustrating and I'm always a bit apprehensive about it because I'm not overly handy. I remember once I got a flat in my current car not long after I bought it. I could not find the jack and tools anywhere. I thought the guy that sold it to me must have kept them and I was really dirty about it at the time. Had to sign up for roadside assistance on the spot (had to pay two years upfront because I was using the service straight away) and wait an hour for them to show up. A few months later I get a flat again and a work colleague is helping me change it over as his work Ute has a jack. He goes to get the spare and finds the jack and tools in a hidden compartment... It was nice that I now had the original stuff but I felt like a massive idiot 😅,2019-02-19 19:01:09
asbgxc,"I have to kick my tire iron to loosen the lug nuts.  Kick it to tighten them too lol 

I got like 4 flat tires in 4 months last year, so I got really good at doing them. 

My favorite experience was when I was changing my tire in the pouring rain and these two middle aged women came around and didnt help at all, but went on and on about how amazing I was to be a woman who knew how to change a tire.  🤷‍♀️ ",2019-02-19 21:30:20

asbgxc,"Agreed. A few years ago, 21 year old me had just gotten off her bank job and was headed home. Saw a car broken down and a dude walking in pouring rain to get gas. Told him to hop in the car and he asked if I was sure, I just told him to not kill me. We laughed about it and had a good time talking during our drive. But what you mentioned about media now a days it's true. Wouldn't have said that if that wasn't always at the back of my mind when helping strangers out. ☹️",2019-02-20 03:47:41

f9gdrf,Anyone else read his comments in his voice ? 🤔,2020-02-26 16:44:34
f9gdrf,"u/GovSchwarzenegger Hello good sir, I have been a life long fan and you are my absolute role model. During Christmas time my sons and I binge watch Jiggle All the Way over any other Christmas movie. It was my favorite as a child. I have read your book Total Recall many times over. Always a good read and being able to view situations as you see them is priceless. I live by your rule of “Always go into something new with a mindset of a newborn.” And “The worst thing I can be is the same as everybody else.” 

I have to thank my uncle Eddie for introducing you to my young self. He was a big part of my childhood showing me your old magazines and videos of you. Watched Pumping Iron together and he loved talking about lifting weights. He opened the gates for me as a young man to live a healthy life style and to look up to the best of the best. He LOVED all your movies. Every time he came over its was one of those for sure. Recently my Uncle Eddie has passed away last Thursday from medical issues. He felt alone and depressed. I loved him so much and thank him everyday for all that he has brought into my life. You were his absolute hero of heros. Can he get a simple word or two from you? Just even a Hello would be enough to make my Uncle Eddie smile for eternity. That is my simple request. Thank you sir Arnold 💪💪",2020-02-26 02:18:04

f9gdrf,"Thank you ❤️ I truly hope I do too. I just want to make my dad proud & be there for him. The first time he went back to the gym after my brother passed away he broke down in tears. A 260lb, 6’1 power lifter. It broke me all over again 💔",2020-02-26 02:57:15

hb44ek,"Hey forest folk! Today was CRAZY (I’ll let you update them on that!) 

For those who don’t know ‘tis I the bringer of the box 😂!

(This story is for the forest folk too!)

I want to tell the story of how I came upon the forest! I lost my cat in the 6th grade and he was supposedly in said forest. So I kept returning to it unfortunately never to find him :( ever since those searches, I had a connection to the forest! It came as a surprise to me when I returned from a week break of going to the forest to find a whole FORT! It was insane and wanted to contact those who made it. So the idea of the BOX popped into my mind! The fact that another group came was incredible! I can’t wait to see who else comes and the amazing encounters we’ll have again in the future!

This is so cool! I grew up in the woods and built crazy structures from like 5 until when we moved when I was 18. A family with kids bought our plot (which was the last house at the end of a mile long road therefore the gate to the extended Midwest wilderness... we went as far as hollowing out old logs for mini kid canoes and having an elaborate tree-ramp-sampling-launching-system.

air1gg,"A couple years ago I found out about an app called BeSpecular (I think?) that was similar to this. It was awesome. Started out telling a guy how to cook his fish sticks from the box’s directions. Helped a lady who worked at Wal-mart by telling her the size of a shirt. Really cool people and requests, I felt good. 

Then the requests became weird. Lots of “what is this picture from facebook?” requests that were corny quotes or indescribable pictures. I’m all for legitimately helping people, but those requests just felt like they were abusing the service. I deleted the app. 😕  ",2019-01-23 00:01:00
air1gg,I love this app!! It’s so heartwarming. The first time I helped someone I cried  (after we hung up of course) I was so touched and sad that someone needed to use an app for a simple task of trying to find what their TV dinner said and the instructions because the couldn’t see it and had no help. I try my best to answer every call and I am so happy someone came up with this idea. The number of volunteers is phenomenal ❤️,2019-01-23 03:21:15

air1gg,This is amazing. Just wow. I'm a helped now! ❤️,2019-01-23 01:35:04
air1gg,I helped someone to get YouTube videos removed of himself that his ex had taken without his permission. Broke my heart that he had to reach out to a stranger to get that done. Made me realize what a vulnerable position he was in and I was glad I could help. It’s also made me more attune to some of the challenges a blind person might have like changing a touch screen thermostat at a hotel or finding the directions on a box of hamburger helper. I also love seeing the occasional seeing eye dog in the background 😊. ,2019-01-23 02:07:49

air1gg,I’ve been a volunteer for a few months now and I’m still waiting nervously for my first call 🙃,2019-01-23 13:02:36
air1gg,I LOVE this app! I’ve gotten 3 calls in the year and half that I’ve had it. The first call was soooo difficult bc you have to tell them to move the phone around to show you what they need help with. My lady needed help setting a blue tooth speaker and it was so difficult. In the end i couldn’t get it set up for her 😣 but it gave me ideas on how to help the next people and better with communicating directions. My next 2 experiences were hard but rewarding. If you want to get a call just be quick when you get the notifications & when you do run to a quiet place! ,2019-01-23 13:47:07
air1gg,"When I first saw this post I thought that you text the blind people what they wanted to now, and then it hit me🤦‍♀️",2019-01-23 16:57:23
air1gg,"Dang, I had it for almost 3 years and only go to 2 calls before someone else. (It rang for me maybe 15 times total.) The second one involved me reading a lady’s mail for her. Interesting experience.

That ratio and the infrequency of calls made that app one of the most recent to go to free up space for memes. 😐",2019-01-23 04:35:31

Had something similar happen to me. When I worked at Starbucks at one point, I didn’t have a car because I had gotten into an accident and it got totaled, so I would take the bus. It started pouring at work one day, and I asked a customer where she got her new umbrella at. She told me at the grocery store next to us, but my shift didn’t end for a while and we kinda jokingly wished that they wouldn’t sell out before I got off. Well, not even 15 minutes later, she came back and handed me an umbrella because she “didn’t want me to be wet and cold on my way home,” so she went back and picked up another one just for me. Almost started bawling right then and there. I never forgot her kindness, I hope everything is going well for her ❤️",2022-08-25 02:56:55

Spoke to the security guard who spoke very little English and tried to ask what happened to the cat. 'Cat? *shrugs* Meow! Where?' Then smiled, made a thorating slitting motion, laughed then proceded to stamp his foot on the floor...

Turns out he'd killed my lil friend and thought he was doing me a favour as cats are considered vermin in the area I was living.

oajwm6,"> She doesn’t let the lack of eyes slow her down, tho.

They never do. They aren't emotionally attached to their parts even when they're old, so it's definitely no issue for a young'un. Adapt and enjoy life. The pain is so much less without the affected eyes that their quality of life skyrockets, anyway. In many cases there will be a night and day difference in their behavior as soon as they've recovered a little from the from the anesthesia. Even though THEY JUST HAD AN EYE CUT FROM THEIR HEAD, they're happy and playful.  I hate when people don't want to enucleate an eye from an animal that's in excruciating pain because they don't like the way it looks. Or the ones who have a silicone implant put in to make it look like there's an eye there. That is such a painful recovery for nothing but cosmetics. 

For anyone reading this, if your animal has severe glaucoma, just enucleate. It's a horrible existence with that much pressure in your eye.

>she has some white fibrous scarring in her right eye, which can only really be seen if there is light directly in her eyes. The vet said that she likely is partially blind in that eye.

Yeah, the corneal scar tissue tends to be opaque, so that makes sense. It's honestly probably fixable by a specialist, but there's no point in spending thousands of dollars on something that won't affect quality of life.

Thank you so much for taking care of them. You're a wonderful human. The world needs more people like you ❤️",2021-06-30 13:50:32

Many unions do not represent workers nor are run by workers. Workers frequently have little influence in how the union works and what it does.

This is not universally true, (i.e. mass teacher strikes), yet it's a complaint I've had brought up to me when trying to organize a workplace before: ""my last union job was so shit, I complained we didn't get breaks and they just told us there's nothing we can do"".

The trick neoliberalism played was severing the left from the working class. They did this by flushing all the leftists out of the unions and flooding middle managers in them, and a lobbyist or two. They were designed to keep the middle class happy and then die. This is why they dont recruit or try to grow. They are trash and we have to start again, preferably without your kind, schweine kapitalisten.",2020-04-22 22:34:30

And even though our children may occasionally veer off the right path in life, we never stop loving them with all our hearts. You didn’t fail her. You’re human and we all mess up sometimes, and moms understand that. She still loved you. 

And congratulations on getting sober! That’s a HUGE accomplishment! Now, the best thing you can do to honor your mom is to stay clean and live the best life you can live.

Same single life on the line, do you sit by and let them die, or do you take action (the only action available) which might directly cause their death? 

In this case, the point of the trolley problem is kinda lost, as there is a correct, even if hard to make, choice, where the trolley problem is an exercise to understand your own morality and processing of guilt in general 🤷🏻‍♂️",2020-08-04 00:59:31

The man got out of his car and I thought he was going to scream at me and I started to cry even more. He ended up asking if I was ok and giving me a hug and trying to help me breathe normally. He said he would call the cops for me and get everything sorted out. He also helped me call my parents so I could get someone to support me on the scene. If it weren’t for his kindness I don’t think I would have been able to handle it. Good news is that his company van had mostly cosmetic damage, and we were both uninjured.

I was on the way to a friend, who was waiting for me.

The man didn't say anything, just got out his insurance info. Finally I said, ""You know, it'd help if you said you were sorry.""

He responded ""I am sorry! I'm working and this will go on my record!"" 😂

He wasn't snarking, either, just utterly whooshed the fact that he'd majorly inconvenienced me when I'd done nothing wrong but was going to have to go through the hassle of having my car fixed.

*On. My. Bicycle.* 🙄

I couldn't really fight it, because I technically did break the law - but as a broke college student, I couldn't afford to pay the $385 fine, either. (It was the exact same ticket that you'd get for running a red light in a car.)

On a friend's advice, I go to court to beg for leniency. I'm nervous as hell, because I've never been in a courtroom before. The judge was very kind - he heard my plea, and instead of bankrupting a kid for being late for a midterm, he gave me 30 hours of community service. 

The best part is, the judge's decision ended up making my life better. I chose to volunteer at a local botanical garden for my service, and that got me interested in conservation, which has led to my lifelong love of volunteering to clean up and fix local hiking trails.

I have been single for most of my adult life (mostly by choice but also by circumstance) and I have learned to be independent and to be great company for myself, and I believe we’re all exactly where we’re supposed to be. But I have reached a point/season in my life where I am INTENSELY lonely and feeling acutely alone. However, I have not yet reached a place (knock on wood) where I am bitter or snarky about others having found theirs. In fact, it almost always brings me some amount of vicarious joy and comfort (and maybe even hope), especially when it is something so fucking awesome, like your story above. 

So. Cheers to your love ☺️",2019-11-16 07:43:18

Since then it's just been AMAZING!! She's in my brain and am In hers.. so we just have tons of wacky fun together.. this woman can make a power outage in chilling temperatures, a wonderful memory of extreme amazement and happiness..

Am pretty sure someone will 'snatch' you up in no time (and you'll have a best friend in a partner.) That's my solemn wish for the day.. a wish for you (knock on wood, actual wood nothing sleazy 😂) to get that person that realises you're already a complete work of art and loves you, for you 🙌

tigr92,"Not for caffeine but for tannins. I’m a betta owner, and I honestly don’t know the science behind it (I don’t really believe in home remedies either) but tannins worked!! I got my boy Sushi some alder ones and mini cattapa leaves. Boiled them for few minutes until I got some dark brown tea color water and used it in his tank. His fins grew back so full and healthy!! Always whenever fish are sick sick, it’s recommended to use tannins either for healing abilities or the darkening of the water. I believe it gives them a calming effect so even the most timid of the species comes out to swim. Especially neon tetras, they live in schools so they become really bold when they get to roam in tannin water 🥰",2022-03-20 13:31:38

From the perspective of the bee that you don't hit , you have changed everything 

Not alone. Not wanting to hurt the world we share is a admirable thing.  Working out how to make more of a difference is the tricky part though.

For me I'm going to plant fruit and nectar trees in my small garden for the birds. After I've finished that project, I'm hoping to sink a supertrawler with a submarine 😂",2022-03-20 14:41:28

I always hope he will just show up but the location I left him is miles away from me and it's been 5yrs since last seeing him. In the rare off chance your new friend might be he (LJ), or most likely not,  it's good to know this fellow has found love in a new home!!

Especially those of us who are salaried. The executives all work out of a different office building across the road from the operations. With the Advent of technology like Skype meetings, they rarely have to come to our building anymore. We sometimes go months without seeing any of them. But on Friday, July 5th of this year, when most of the professional world was enjoying a long holiday weekend, our CEO decided to take a stroll around the operations office to say hi and see what we were working on.

I was basically told I make my own hours, but when there’s no work to be done, I would be paid to sit and wait for the phone to ring (he HAAAAATES answering the phone.) There is the same set work to do each week, and it depends on how quickly the rest of the office gets their job done. If they are delayed, I have nothing to do, so I can come in later if I want. If I want to stay late to finish the work instead of start early the next day, I can, and vice versa. All the work gets done, to a better standard than with the previous person, by the bosses own admissions. Best job and best boss ever 🙌🏻",2019-07-26 12:20:40

Solid person!  Great employee!  Probably punished for it in the metrics.  

This is such low hanging fruit for the massive freight companies, I’m surprised there isn’t far more development.  Amazon is making moves, the garage door opener springs to mind.  I would think that far more would be happening though.  Why does every new build not have a parcel “bunker” for example?  

Yes I’m aware there are probably better solutions than I can pull off the top of my head at 11pm on a Saturday after a few drinks 😂",2021-05-16 04:08:56
ncytio,"Before the green bins (for recycling) where a permanent thing here, you had to request a tote. It looked like a standard Sterilite tote, but green with COH and recycling symbols. I'd leave it on the side of the house as it was pretty useless in actually holding all my recyclables.  My driver would always stash my things there. If it were rainy, he'd move it to the covered patio in back. 
I hate they changed his route.😞",2021-05-16 15:35:18

ncytio,"A large plastic bin or tote with a lock is ideal. A lot of my houses have them at the end of the driveway by the gate. 

But they work well in more urban areas on the front porch.  also. I've even seen apartments with lockboxes outside. Some people get shit delivered literally everyday. So they take their security seriously. 

And to those people, I say thank you. You're paying my bills. Keep ordering. 😂",2021-05-15 21:02:18

hd4v4k,"She flew away after 10 mins i stopped recording. :)

Edit: I think she s a swift. I stopped recording to call a friend of mine who s a veterinarian. We have examined her according to our friends’ instructions. As i ve mentioned after 10 mins she just flew away. That just made our day ^^

Being able to help is the most amazing feeling on earth.

Edit II : Thanks for all the kind words and advices. 
I’m sure that everyone in this community would have done the same. 

These small actions make our lives worth living. 

🙏🏻

Edit III : I got offers from media outlets to license the video for commercial use. If they accept to donate the earnings to WWF fund we will have a deal. 

I’ll keep you posted if that happens :)

I was wondering though, we used to have a dog (sadly passed away a long time ago, he was very old), and I’ve been told that doing things like this enforces the beliefs of the dogs that there is indeed something special and scary going on, reinforcing their fears.

Nice terrible replies, everyone:

“So you’re saying everyone uses every phone all the time every day???” — No obviously not, weirdly defensive

“My anecdote cancels out your anecdote” — okay, I didn’t say everyone uses every phone all the time every day anyway so that’s fine

“Yeah well I don’t know anyone who would spend time at an animal shelter so fuck what you’re saying” — why was my innocuous comment taken as a personal attack on this guy? I didn’t even think about this specific guy when I made this comment, he’s volunteering at a shelter in a picture on the internet that could be god knows how old. I only care about people apparently *never* seeing in their real lives anyone who’s constantly stuck in their phone screens, because that makes no sense to me as someone with eyes who looks at people occasionally. 

Legit curious at this point if even one person aside from me has seen someone spend hours staring at their phone without hardly looking up. Probably gonna just mute notifications and check back in a week to see if anyone who actually read my comment replied ✌️",2022-07-05 14:27:54

vrx4dh,"Yes, it is - if it's done wrong; especially if you're adding baby talk and cooing at them, and such.
The worst is to give them treats while they are freaking out.

Have you heard of a Thunder Shirt? I'm taking care of my granddogs this weekend and the male is especially bad with fireworks. It didn't help that his mom and dad just moved to a new community last year that goes completely nuts with fireworks at every damn holiday. So now he's even worse.

He's on tranqs AND now he's got a new Thunder Shirt. This thing is awesome. It creates pressure kinda like holding him tightly all around his body. I put it on him last night. He still hid under the bed, but he wasn't freaking out as bad.

It's a precarious game, though. If you wait for the split second when they are in control that's when you do regular praise, and do the voice changes, and add the treats. It's hard to catch the right moment. 

Mainly YOU have to be calm. Do a lot of self-calming breathing - or whatever it takes to keep yourself calm throughout the whole thing. You can't ever let them see you sweat 😉

Here's an article that talks about how you can create that pressure by doing a specific type of petting in a very specific way. I think it's item #6 in the article.

vrx4dh,"Ooof, you have my sympathies! Working at dog daycares wasn't quite that bad because at least most of the dogs would forget about their owners once they realized where they were again. Separation anxiety wasn't as frequent as inappropriate play style/poor socialization with other dogs, that was the biggest hurdle to cross with 90% of owners...there's only so many ways to nicely tell a delusional person ""your dog is an asshole and needs behavior modification training."" 🤦‍♀️

My bf later quit from stress so I had very little friends at my job accept for our amazing friend. Every day when I was stressed I'd sit at his desk at lunch and talk with him if he was there. He is an amazing man with so many pets, fostering kids with various problems, and was a lead for one of the most stressful areas and got zero credit for it. He is the most amazing man I ever met besides my boyfriend, and is an amazing father figure. We are only six years apart but I feel like one of his kids. He told me that he loves me far more than my real father ever will, and is probably going to be one of the only few people i feel comfortable crying in front of. We constantly look out for each other and he has given me new hope in people's parenting. Shout-out to Chris!! ❤️",2022-01-15 04:39:16

Likewise it has phone numbers, personal notes of why her life is worth living, fidgets, cotton balls w/essential oils for smell , mp3 player w/personal uplifting music, a journal and pencil. Meaningful objects  to engage the 5 senses that are effective in distracting your mind. She has used this box successfully many times to get her through the critical moments.  I'm glad you have taken steps to have a plan in place and I hope it is helpful for you, too!  
My 16yo daughter had multiple serious suicide attempts over a 2yr period. 2 in which she was in critical condition.  She spent a total of 9 months in a couple of mental health rehab facilities until we were told they could no longer help her and, exhausting what we thought were all our options medically and financially, signed papers to have her commited to the state mental hospital. Luckily, the waiting list to get in was several months long and during this time, she made enough progress that they released her to come home at a lower level of care where she spent all day at treatment, but was allowed to come home at night.   After 3months at home, she attempted again on  Xmas day and we were back at square one we're facing institutionalizing her.  Through a miracle, our insurance approved a $90k inpt. stay at a private teen mental rehab program out of state. She spent 3 months there and since she was released, 1.5 yrs ago she has had Zero suicidal ideation and zero self harm. It is a true miracle! And even though she will most likely have to be on some sort of meds and remain vigilant of her mental health for the rest of her life, she is here, alive and thriving!
Sorry for the long post to make a short point.  My message is, never give up!  No matter how utterly hopeless you feel and however bleak the future looks,  things can get better with time.  Depression/Anxiety/mental illness is a horrible disease with a huge lack of public knowledge, empathy and resources available!  We  must do better!
Stay strong, keep trying, and know things can get better. 💜 Peace and love to you!",2020-06-06 20:27:04

95peno,"I experienced my first adrenaline rush a couple the months ago. I heard someone screaming help behind my house. Went outside and looked over the fence into the neighbor's yard. Couldn't see anything, but kept hearing a woman screaming. I saw my neighbor next door to me poking her head over the fence too. I said fuck it. My 5'3"" self ran and leapt over a 6' fence. Twice. The second fence I didn't realize there was a gate to go through 🤦 When I got to the helps I found an elder lady that had a garbage bin on top of her. (she just had surgery on her leg, and I guess it gave out on her while taking the trash out). She called me an angel for getting to her. The other neighbor who was looking over said she couldn't get that vision out of here head of me leaping over the big ass fence. She said it wasn't human like. When the paramedics and police arrived they looked at the fence. Looked back at me, and called me a superhero. When I got back home I had this rush of pain. I had scrapes all over my body, and splinters all over my hand from going over that fence. A few days after I tried to pull myself over it again. It wasn't as easy.",2018-08-09 06:57:59

He's 13 and he fishes off the dock in the back and he just refuses any kind of education I provide him with. I don't know why he's so close minded or where he ever got the wrong information but he's the most stubborn kid I've ever met. He believes fish don't feel pain therefore it's true, period, he doesn't care what anyone has to say. He so fuckin rough with my fish friends 😔

whsb7o,"There are actually federal regulations that protect certain species too like snapper, grouper, etc. where you have to use non stainless circle hooks and descending devices to release them safely. The circle hook is so it cheek hooks them and not swallowed, and in the event you do need to cut the hook, it will rust in days. I’m okay with it, but I think people would be surprised to see how well/hard American fishing waters are regulated down to the type of gear you can even use, let alone when and what you can keep. Fish Rules app will help you learn them.

By rough, I mean when he reels one in, he steps on it with his shoe, pressing it against the seering hot deck because he's a pussy and doesn't like to touch icky fish. He then uses pliers like a pussy for like 3 minutes to coax the hook out. We've all tried to teach him how to handle a fish and how to take the hook out but he ends up killing most of them. He loves fishing though, the releasing part he needs to work on. I'm not always giving him a hard time though... I'm not a bitch 😁",2022-08-06 20:56:37

I did love going to school though because i got to see my friends so i didn't wanna skip anyway and i don't think i realized school *caused* the migraines. I can relate to needing to just not go.

I was sick one day and mom let me stay home but when she got home i was feeling better and she was like u were supposed to be sick, like it's somehow my fault and bad that i'm getting better. I mean shouldn't u be glad if ur kid is better instead of going ""j'accuse!""? 🙄 Like ease off! It's one day. I could have skipped a bunch in elementary and never once did. Do i get kudos for that?

d95esb,I had an elderly neighbor named Dave who would always be walking his dog around the time I walked home from middle school and high school. Every time I saw him I would pet his dog and he would always encourage me to keep working hard in school whenever I told him how boring school was. He did the same for my sister (six years older than me) and always encouraged her to keep pursuing her dream of becoming a doctor. Never knew how much that encouragement meant until he passed away from cancer right after I graduated high school. My sister is now in med school and I graduated uni this past year. Wish Dave was here to see us tho ❤️,2019-09-25 19:24:44
d95esb,"When i was a teenager we had a family with 7 kids live next door. 6 were girls 12 or younger. Would run up and ask me if I could play, would run over when they saw me gardening, loved to come pet my cat, pick flowers from my yard, anything. I started buying sidewalk chalk and bubbles for them.

They moved away years ago but the family came to my wedding last spring ❤",2019-09-25 19:18:36

9htd00,"Look into Core Beliefs and how they are formed when you are young. They can be undone so for you it’s trusting men and to do that, you’ll need to find nurturing examples to show you that you do not have to fear anyone. I’m sure you know of friends Fathers etc who would fit this ‘ideal’ father figure role.  

You were abused, which will never be your fault in a million years. A weak, spineless excuse for a ‘man’ did that but it does not mean you have to carry that burden - you’ve done so long enough.

I spent thirty years scared thanks to all manner of abuses from male family members. You can recover and for you, you needn’t waste as much time as I did. 👍🏻

a6x0dh,"As someone who has a mild form of epilepsy, my visual signs are I lick my lips consistently, sort of go in and out of a conversation like someone who appears really not interested in the topic at hand. Mine are very mild though caused by lack of sleep, stress, dehydration. I’ll rarely have one public if not only 2 and most people know if they have a history know their triggers. I’m fully aware when I have mine, some if not most other people either pass out like this lady or lose their balance. What the “protocol” would be is don’t over react just grab their arm and make sure they don’t fall onto something hard or sharp if they fall over, and obviously take anything that might break like a baby out of their hands 😆. Don’t try and stop the convulsions all you can do is make sure whatever happens is make sure they’re safe from their surroundings if they are going to fall make sure you help them fall down as they could fall hard and put them
On their back and they don’t choke on their tongue which is rare but just watch out for it. If it goes on for longer than 4 min, and foaming at the mouth occurs then call an ambulance ASAP.

Mine and the few I’ve had I just move my head from the center to the right, making loud exhale noises just standing up. They last like 30 seconds and then I return to normal I don’t fall over or anything. I only had a few in public and I can tell when they’re coming so I can go find a private place. But the ones I’ve had in public I can tell by people face they don’t have a clue WTF is going on. Interestingly people in the vicinity don’t see or help with what’s going on, just go about their business. Which to me is bizarre because if I witness this happen to someone else, I’d go over and make sure they’re ok instead of sipping my Starbucks and going about my day. Also as sort of a thing not to do is call 911 first thing, make sure they’re ok then if it’s bad after a about a min or 2 then call. I’ve had to stop people from calling when I know what is happening to me and I come out of it and try and convince them to hang up. If they’re anything like me it just adds to the embarrassment, and more stressful. But do as you feel as necessary. Just asses the situation for a min or two to make sure they don’t fall over and hurt themselves. Usually a Gran Mal which is usually the first one and the first sign something is wrong (for me it was my first sign I had a brain tumour, had MRI that day and taken out 2 weeks later)  it was the only time I fell over onto my back and was foaming out of my mouth and was about 4 or 5 min from what I was told. That time was the only time I was happy someone had called for an ambulance.",2018-12-17 10:42:49
a6x0dh,"Trigger warning ⚠️ 

Some people get the feeling of one coming, it’s called aura. You start to get dizzy and light headed, adrenaline rushing. The type of seizure I experienced started with the contraction of the right side of my body, I was alone fo all of them so I tried to fall to the side and hope for the best. You completely space out, but I ‘came back’ close to the end of the episode. The first thing I remember is telling myself to breathe but my inside voice was this super distorted and high pitched voice.

You ‘wake up’ extremely tired and can’t produce sentences. You know what you want to say but can’t. Luckily I didn’t shit myself.

9okdv1,"Not a shark expert by any stretch, but most animals have evolved communication of some kind, whether conscious or not - especially those who have communities, as sharks do. Dolphins chatter and have extensive body language; fish use body language and also colour and chemical signals. Sharks might be somewhere in that spectrum?

It's reasonable to assume that since they live in groups, and communication typically favours survival of both group and individual genes, they have likely evolved with some kind of communication.

Now I want to Google shark language 😄

Edit: basic Googling tells me that they don't have any throat organs that can produce sound - they are a perfectly silent hunter. Scientists have established that they use complex body language to send signals around mating and group hierarchy. They also use their strong sense of smell, which is on the level of chemical communication. Researchers who study specific schools report recognition on the part of those they are studying.

eiavlp,"Every new year of school something similar happens  to me, but I'm so used to I just roll my eyes. Kids are SO predictable that I've changed school so many times, had so many different classes with different people, and it's ALWAYS the same thing.
 For example, I'm pretty bad at understanding anything Math related things, very bad with numbers in general, like time, distance, heights, simple countings etc, and when it comes to grammar, I have some (very mild, but is there) diction problems and I forget words very easily mid sentence and I tend to mimic or try my best to say the closest or opposite to the word I want so maybe people can understand me (or my bilingual brain farts and I can only remember it in English, but can't remember in Portuguese ~my 1st language).
What happens is the same very thing and it's so annoying, cuz I ask a lot of questions in class, like, dude I'm trying to get a good grade here, and ACTUALLY LEARN something, so the first weeks before the first tests people ALWAYS looks at me like I am dumb, refuse to join me in group works or wtvr, which for me is cool, cuz I prefer doing stuff alone and I wouldn't want to be in a group or even friends with people that treat others like that. But the thing is, I'm not dumb at all, I'm actually ~generally~ pretty smart, I'm creative too, I just have some difficulties that I've learn how to deal with in course of life (I'm 20, still in high school due to some personal issues I had a few years ago, now studying a Technical course in Environment), and when the firsts test happens, and students LOVE to share their grades 🙄 they ALWAYS seem so impressed that I usually get the higher grades in most classes (last year I literally got the higher grades in 9 of the 11 subjects, and the other 2 I got the second higher), and when they see I'm actually not stupid, they wanna be friends and put in their groups, which I don't accept (I used to join them when I was younger, but I've learn kids never wanna learn anything, specially how to treat people better, in my experience they only cared about how I would help them getting better grades), prefer doing stuff alone or with the people that actually treat me right (I was part of a such a good trio last year,  and we probably are going to stay together again this year).
What usually happens after is also pretty annoying. People stop treating me like I was dumb as a door, and start treating me like I was the most intelligent nerd ever and keeps asking me stuff and stays in my butt if I get something wrong 🙄🙄🙄 (usually are guys, idk if it's an ego/sexist thing that happens in male brain that needs to put women down or it's something else, but it happens just as I described EVERY YEAR, it's a flawed pattern for sure).
 Honestly I'm not dumb, but also I'm not the smartest nerd, I'm just a good student, that pays attention in class, actually listens to the teachers, just care about my own business, study when I can (I hate studying at home but I do my best). I don't know everything, I just wanna learn some grammar, math, geography and how to help save the fucking planet, God!",2020-01-01 14:18:51

My parents weren't really supportive of this idea.

q4qfno,"I work with kids who have special needs and I just want to say thank you for being the kind of driver who appreciates them. My kids would run to the window and try running out the door each time they heard the truck coming. It’s something that completely fascinates them. One time, before I could stop them, one of my kids ran to a driver and handed him a picture they colored of Baby Yoda. I was worried the driver wouldn’t acknowledge my client or would not accept their picture. Instead he took it and pinned it to his visor. My kiddo talked about it for months and watched for the same driver each time he heard a truck. Thank you for making the day great for these kids ❤️",2021-10-10 00:50:21

r26ywf,"Awee so cute...i had a fish like that for 10 years and came home he was floating sideways about to die..barely breathing...

.without thinking.....i scooped him up,  put him in the toilet and helped him swim around...
He started getting better...so i started pulling him out blowing his mouth...and putting him back in the toilet bowl...

A few times and he was swimming like a champ...😁😁

And no...i didn't put my mouth on him....but it was like fish cpr...he lived another 10 years.

Im still amazed it actually worked...the things we do for our pets...i win him at a school fair,never thought he would live that long..


The other fish in the tank had cancer...i guess that's what caused charlie to almost die before his time...",2021-11-26 00:14:49

vsxkkg,"On that subject, I remember a huge turning point in my life, (as someone who deals with personal mental health issues and used to be a poly-drug addict)
Was seeing a study and the results of which, on the roles of community as the cure for addiction. Socializing has really changed my life for the better over the last four years, it kind of took me back to my youth when AOL, Napster, MSN Messenger, limewire and stuff like that was around due to the pandemic limiting my social exploration to online for the most part. 

But I found ways to meet new friends through gaming, and other online groups and forums (including Reddit! Yay for Reddit!! 😍😁🤟) And honestly, it's true. Community IS the cure to addiction, and learning to socialize is such a powerful tool for someone with mental illnesses, or even someone without! We are social creatures by nature, and when we get isolated, be it through circumstances or by our own design (usually unintentionally) those dormant mental illness traits and symptoms get magnified or amplified, like a feedback loop, as the person only has themselves to bounce ideas and emotions off, and it can get kind of scary over time (from experience, I'm better now tho!)

😅 My apologies for this novel-length response. 
I just wanted to show that I agree with your comment and how important socializing is in all aspects of life. That's good to hear that institutions are realizing this and putting it to use 👍😁",2022-07-10 20:26:08

So whatever problem he mentioned “some bullshit happens, often times through no fault of their own…” it’s usually the liberals fucking over low income workers with or without papers 🤷🏽‍♂️ I stand by my opinion that if you’re homeless it’s your fault.

I told him I didnt have and I didnt mind paying for it. What do you want?

You can also try just leaving the drinks out during the hottest times of the day or around lunch time when people maybe necessarily haven't had time to take off to get food but are at the end where they need something to replenish.

xdj6ec,"This guy reminds me of my dad so much, i wish I could hug him.

When i had my dad dad ❤️ i was a varsity band member for all for years of high school. He always cheered for every kid at graduation, but harder for the band kids. Because my dad was a die hard Dan for the band my parents would always provide water for every single band event for full 6 years we attended. From my beginning to my brother's graduation (which my dad passed before). My dad went to every event and parade with his oxygen tank and cheered hard. After he passed they gave him an acknowledgement at my brother's graduation.",2022-09-14 05:54:34

He'll come get me for toys under the couch, the last piece of food stuck in his puzzle toy, the cat laying in his spot 😅

He also thinks that I'm the boss of everything, so he often comes to me to ""tell on"" my husband if he's doing things ""wrong"", like being too slow getting his food or leash, or if he's late coming home from work. It's adorable.",2019-10-10 11:05:13

dm1nuq,"I scraped a light on someone’s car while hastily parking once. I left him a note and he told me he didn’t even notice. I told him I would send him a new light and install if for him if he needed help doing that. 

I then asked my friend to order a the part for me (he’s in the parts business) and he asked I should have just walked away. I told my friend I didn’t want someone to do that to me. The guy looks like he takes good care of his vehicle and if that was me, I would be distressed over it. 

The other car’s owner was grateful and I learned a few lessons...My daughter can be late to school sometimes, my multi-million dollar earning friend isn’t so honest and I taught my daughter that even though I had to skimp on other things because I needed to replace someone’s tail lamp is the right thing to do.

rk1z5c,"Muay Thai is different about respect. And it varies on places about tradition. Like US you’re probably not going to get that type of culture unless you roll into a thai boxing gym that’s really engrained in that. 

Boxing yeah meh 😂... And bjj,fuck lol. That’s one of the reasons why I didn’t take it.

Even in martial arts it gets lazy at times. In a dojang I went back to there was a lot of disrespectful things and it came from the head master on down. But you could see it in the younger black belts especially. What what even worse was they would bump some awful music to keep try and keep teens hyped.

They put me in a class with some. Head master gave me a white belt instead of the brown I left with. We rotated on holding shields for spinning back kicks. I was holding shields for them on kicks. And they kicked liked bitches. Thing was, they were trying to kick me holding the shield really hard. Due to racism etc.

When I was there before, we learned a style from power TKD era. We didn’t foot fence, we trying to break peoples bones and souls. Fuck points 😂.

Black belt holding the shield saw my belt, and didn’t even bother to get into a stance. I kicked, he flew. I went over and helped him up. Which he didn’t really like. Then I showed them (through him) why they couldn’t knock me back or down from both sides and also how I get more power in my kicks. 

They were pissed, but the instructor was impressed. And he was like “why tf are you a white belt”",2021-12-19 22:17:21

zl3720,"All of these people are responding to you citing Henry Ford, are actively ignoring the decades of struggle to get it implemented that came before. The first eight hour workday was implemented in 16th century Spain. But in the modern, industrial period, people like the Utopian Socialist, Robert Owen, we're experimenting with 8 and 10 hour days in the early 19th century.

Labor organizers in the United States were pushing for the 8 hour day as far back as 1836. The famous Haymarket Affair, In 1886, which resulted in 12 deaths and over 100 injuries, was initially a rally in support of the 8 hour workday.
A series of strikes demanding the 8 hour day, swept the US north east in 1915.

And that's all not even taking into account that Federal employees in the US had the 8 hour day (though not universally enforced), as far back as 1868. 

And that's only scratching the surface with a focus on the United States. Henry Ford didn't establish the 8 hour day at his company until 1926. The US would only see the full enactment of the modern 40 hour work week in 1937.

Ford was incredibly late to the party, and enacted it at his company due to the long-standing social and political movement that was long bubbling in the wider culture. Not out of your goodness of his heart, or simply because of The Free Market™.

The eight hour day was paid for in blood, and was in no way, shape or form, simply handed to you.",2022-12-14 00:33:06

Thank you OP for making these masks!!  u/Youareyou64

I'm a nurse in the underfunded, understocked, NHS national health service in Scotland.  I can't work as I am in Very High Risk category and with there also not being enough protective equipment... It's just too dangerous for me to be there right now. As much as it pains me inside... Can't help feeling I've let the side down.  Nursing and helping people is in my core..
But best thing I can do for the NHS is to not become a patient myself by being a martyr and exposing myself.   You're doing an *amazing* thing here.  Making such a difference 💕💕💕💕  I love to see people, helping people.  The staff will be beyond greatful and appreciative for these gifts  ❣️",2020-03-28 16:06:54

Depending on your relationship with the old person, it can either warm you all over and make you smile, or it will give you that knowing feeling that you’ve *disappointed* said old person, which is one of the worst possible feelings to ever experience.

fmydio,"Hi!

This is the original post: https://twitter.com/beauty2streetz/status/1241468899972935680?s=21

I didn’t know about her but apparently she has an organization which helps homeless people giving them food, makeup, clothing, and hygiene. I don’t usually share this stuff but while I watched some of her other videos I felt like she is a real hero.

Stay safe these days! ♥️

Edit: Thanks for the awards! It’s so nice to see all this positivity, especially these days. Spread love and stay safe.♥️✨ As someone commented, her name is Shirley Raines. I’m sorry I didn’t mention it earlier but I didn’t know who she was. 
I’ll leave here her social media in case you want to check out the work she’s doing.

exd0u7,Hope it all works out for you 👍,2020-02-02 18:01:10
exd0u7,"Yo I had to comment cisplatin bro! For me I have terminal stage 4 colon cancer but also the BRCA1 gene mutation so even though the cancer is pretty much everywhere besides my breasts breast cancer chemo like platinums worked amazing. 

Started with ocsaliplatin but after 4 treatments I had a massive allergic reaction swelling of my tongue and couldn’t breathe but ended up fine. Since then I did cisplatin for 2 years worked wonders and saved my life. Sadly nowadays it’s spread to my spine and bones and some areas aren’t responding to it so I finally switched to irenoteacan and had 5fu all along so more traditional colon cancer chemo.

Anyways always fun to hear from people that beat it and now in remission, since that will never happen for me I love living vicariously through posts like this and comments like yours I hope you have way way more then 3 years of good life and that jr doesn’t come back ❤️ 

If you don’t mind me asking I’m so so sorry if this is sensitive or painful but what’s it like having no tongue? I’ve had to have things removed but not that so I’m merely curious if it’s painful to answer please disregard it. Just like is drinking/eating different or talking affected? My lymph nodes all have tons of cancer including one has grown to block my kindey function so I have a stent in my ureter, what kind of symptoms and side effects did you have from the removal of the lymph nodes both surgery and post life? Just want to get any info I can in case I have to get mine removed, which I’ve had both hips replaced and many many more surgeries so I’m sure I can handle it but hey While I’m here I might as well ask someone who has been through it.

Again I’m sorry for rambling and for the questions if they are painful, I saw you talking about cisplatin and had to login and reply and I really do hope that you are enjoying and making the most of your life post cancer, it’s kind of crazy for me thinking about that since I’m almost 25 and I was diagnosed at 18 so my entire adult life has been dealing with it to suddenly be cured and go back to normal must have been very tough I certainly empathize with what you are going through and again much love ❤️",2020-02-02 02:36:27
exd0u7,"I commented up above so you can read that if you want but cisplatin family here :) I Am so fucking sorry for your loss god I feel like shit throwing a pity party occasionally or being mad at life for the hand I was dealt when it’s been multiple miracles to still be alive and almost make it to my 25th birthday it could always be much worse which is why I’m so thankful and grateful for life. Which also makes me so sad for people who want to commit suicide, i have depression and anxiety but I don’t pretend to fully understand what they are going through and I wish so badly they could enjoy and be happy with life but at the same time I think man why can’t we switch bodies and healthiness. 

One of my favorite shirts is one I got at md Anderson after going there for genetic testing to see if there are any good trial chemos and then emergency surgery to remove blood clots that were basically in my entire legs and swelling my entire legs and scrotum to the tube of 50 pounds in 3 weeks and I’m pretty skinny before that. If I didn’t have my Ivc filter I would have 100 percent been dead and if they didn’t emergency surgery for 6.5 hours with 3 surgeons working 5 surgical sites I would have died pretty soon. Anyways point being while there the shirt I got just says Cancer Sucks lol. I don’t know why maybe just the understated casual approach to it or what but yeah cancer definitely sucks.

Like I said above I love living vicariously through people that beat it and are in remission congratulations, happy anniversary to your first dose that allowed you to continue enjoy life for years to come and I wish you good luck in the decades to come you deserve peace happiness and good health ❤️❤️",2020-02-02 02:43:52

exd0u7,"Lol I agree with you, I have 2 and it just confuses the hell out of me. I’m not interesting at all 😂",2020-02-02 03:55:15
exd0u7,"I never get to talk to younger people with similar experiences to mine so I greatly appreciate the love that is going around here. Only kid I knew was this little guy, quite a few years younger than me but he looked up to me since I had beat it. I know it’s impossible but obviously I wish I could have done more to make it easier for him. I’ll have to see how I can handle being around is family tomorrow...

It’s sounds like cancer took you for quite the trip. The funny thing is, even when I was sick, I kept telling my friends how lucky I got, because for someone in the “kid with cancer” category, I had it about as easy as it gets. Surgery to remove the initial and largest tumor, a month or two of doctors arguing over what to do, 4 months of chemo, and I was out. They really hesitated to take out my lymphatic system surgically, but because I was young, mostly healthy, and they couldn’t find any more traces in my abdomen or lungs, they gave me a pass...

Everyone in life goes through different things, and everyone in life deserves to have their own grievances. One bad day may seem like a beautiful thing in comparison once you find yourself in a different situation. But as long as people have your back, and I promise there will always be at least one person, things tend to shape up in the end ♥️♥️♥️

cnf7ev,"As a 19 year old still in the system only for benefits but I’m living on my own, I feel this.

I still keep contact with most of my foster brothers and sisters from across all the homes I lived in. Spanning 8 homes I try to check on a different one each week.

(Fake names but latest updates)

Arial is in college too, we’re the 3% who actually are prusuing and going to get our college degrees.

Kay, well. Kay is a drug addict.

Jay jay moved in with a friend of mine after a bad breakup.

Saul joined the military, he’s holding his own new Brothers in Arms now. 

John. Well... John is still a prostitute who I can’t help because it’s what he wants to do, he’s staying clean though!

Rob died.

Zed is moving on with her life, I don’t see a way up for her tbh.

Kass has two kids, she’s kicking ass at being a mom. I think Kass finished college though.

Tay is, well. Nobody knows. Nobody has seen her or heard from her in a long time.


Everybody chose their own paths, we were all able to set ourselves up for success and almost nobody did. It’s sad, but we don’t look toward the future. We learned to live in the present with our past staring down our backs, ready to stab us at any moment.

For me, I’m paving my way. Going on with College after a nasty breakup where I was beat horribly by my fiancé. Moving on slowly, but surely. 

One day I’ll see the day where I’ll be where I wish to be in life, who that’s with I only dream to know. I wish to be married eventually, have a solid job and two boxers. A stay at home wife or kids to help out with the dogs.

But for now, it’s just me, college, my cat Stinky, and a gaming PC with thousands of memories ready to be cracked open at any moment.


To anyone still reading this, consider adoption or fostering eventually. You can save a childs life, not to mention mental health, and help set them up for the success many of us never had.

I ended up breaking up with them because it got to a point where I’d only be able to see them once or twice every 6 months/a year and never saw them again. I heard they ended up saying fuck it and actually moving in with a man anyways which cut me like a knife but I’ve tried many times to track them down over the years with zero luck. It’s like they’ve disappeared off the face of the earth. I’m with someone else now but it’s very hard to shake so I’m happy it worked out for you ❤️,2022-12-07 00:34:19

Idk maybe I'm just in a sappy mood (better than a meltdown, my therapist says 😅), but that's just.... that's a really nice moment.

Yes, without any context or examples you are allowed to clutch your pearls as tightly as you want.

No way I was refering to 6x 70L bags of pop cans in the back of a Tayota.

w9icgl,"I understand that you're trying to come from a good place of ""don't tell others what to like no matter their disability,"" but your original question: 1) is sexist, because it assumes that men do not like gold speckles or pink flower art, and 2) assumes that the sister didn't give him a choice in decorating. We don't have enough evidence either way to know if he had a say. He may have had no choice, had no preference, picked out some things himself, or picked out everything himself. 

I would like to point out that he has both a Rarity & Rainbow Dash (My Little Pony - Friendship is Magic) stuffies on his bed, so the choices may very well have been his.

hk5y0x,"Yeah, depression sucks; I have to like make myself do stuff I like sometimes. Damned wad of soggy bacon in my skull always telling lies about stuff being pointless and boring 😒 If I catch myself going ""I'm bored but nothing sounds fun"" I just pick something at random (usually a video game) and start doing it out of spite, like ""shut up, brain, *you're* boring and pointless; I'm gonna play subnautica, it's gonna be fun, and you're not gonna stop me"" so I basically end up having fun on accident while my brain is like ""well shit, he called my bluff, i guess i have to make some seratonin now"" lol. My meds help and my dog and cats too but I still have to push past some of the fucky brain chemistry. Sometimes that's walking the dog when I don't feel like it, sometimes it's just getting out of bed when my defective skulljello wants me to just lay there and suffer. Doing something that ""matters"" helps too, like rn I'm making a baby blanket for a friend's first kid and a backpack for my SO; even if my lying brain is right and my life is pointless, I can still make this blanket that'll be important for this kiddo, I can make a cute backpack that'll make my SO happy. Some days I've got [all the spoons,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory) some days I make do with a single rusty spork, lol, but I muddle through.

With SIs, tbh I'm not really sure where they come from, usually I'll come across something that's interesting in a ""oh neat"" kinda way and most of the time that's about it but sometimes the more I find out about it, the more I want to learn and the next thing I know it's been 10 hours and I've got like 50 open tabs about it 😂 That happened like 5 or 6 years ago and now I have a ton of info in my head about heraldry.

No need to apologize for not knowing, you're asking for info instead of making assumptions, I don't mind explaining! Autism is complicated and there's always new info being found. [ASAN has a ton of info and resources, too!](https://autisticadvocacy.org/)",2020-07-03 08:20:56

hk5y0x,"Well brains are mostly fat with water+salt electrolytes and neuroproteins. So it's basically soggy bacon in a semiliteral sense, and it's similarly analogous to gelatin (jello) to a lesser degree, so skulljello.

Thinking about it that way is helpful for coping with neurological problems because... Well, I mean who's going to win an argument: me, an entire human being, or half a breakfast with delusions of grandeur? 😂

The language you use for things can be pretty powerful, so I like to use terms that give me more power than my brainweirdness as much as possible.

Also: [I kinda responded to a shower-thoughts tumblr using the soggy bacon equivalence and it went slightly viral](https://willow-wanderings.tumblr.com/post/181384816112/showerthoughtsofficial-the-brain-is-just-8-lbs-of) so I just keep using it because it's more likely that people will already be familiar with it",2020-07-04 02:37:04
hk5y0x,"Yeah, it sounds simple but it took me a long time to really get the hang of it. Depression (and autism too, lots of brainweirdness does this for some reason) sabotages your ""executive function"" system. It's the part of brain process that lets you make the jump from ""thinking about doing a thing"" and ""actually going and doing the thing,"" it also handles the logistical details like figuring out what order to do parts of a task in. 

That might sound inconsequential but it's actually required to do even the most basic tasks. Lets say you're hungry. Your brain goes ""hm, i need some calories"" and then it has to move to ""what options do i have for that"" (just making that jump takes executive function). So lets say you manage to pick one ""i think I'll have some cereal,"" now you have to work out what order to do the steps in (go to kitchen, pour cereal, get bowl, check if you have milk, find spoon, eat cereal, sit down to eat); if the steps being listed in that order bother you, welcome to being a brain, lol. Putting all those steps into an order that will result in yummy cereal getting into your mouth takes executive function.

So if you have depression or ADHD or autism (or maybe you're sUpEr LuCkY like me and have all three 😵), your executive function *doesn't work.* So you have to do all of that work yourself. Neurotypical folks (people without mental health wonkiness) don't have to do any of that; their brain does all of it for them in the background with no need for conscious input. It's kinda like the installation wizard in Microsoft systems that means you only have to click the ""do the thing"" button and the wizard makes all the actual installation decisions for you. If you've got atypical neurology that hamstrings your executive function, your brain is basically running Linux; it won't do anything *unless you manually type in every command and file path yourself.*

This is part of why depression is *physically and mentally exhausting.* You're having to do 5 times the work for 3/4 of the accomplishment. So having coping mechanisms that get around the nonexistent executive function helps a whole lot. Which is how I've found stuff like this. If you can't decide what to do cuz it all sounds pointless then *don't try to decide*. Just skip that step cuz your brain won't do it anyway, do the first thing you come across and be proud of yourself for getting it done to hack your brain into doing it's job and making with the happy chemical.

Do it for long enough (especially if you have help from medication or therapy or a support group) and skipping the executive function for some tasks becomes a habit your brain will do automatically. That's how I've gotten from ""fucking soggy bacon won't let me get out of bed"" to ""I'll decide whether to get out of bed after I have some calories and walk the dog"" and poof I'm out of bed hunting for cheerios and getting doggo snuggles, and feeling good about accomplishing it!

- Develop routines for simple tasks until they become muscle memory (e.g. for ""deciding"" what to eat just keep several options available that you could eat basically any time and that take little to no effort to make)

- Don't try to decide on tasks, that's a trap, go with a random option (again having multiple options that are all about equally good helps)

I see babies and toddlers and children (honestly anybody younger than me) and I want to hug them and kiss their heads and tell them they're good and watch them grow. I get the exact same ""I wanna squeeze you and tell you I love you"" feeling whenever I look at any and all primates. 

Watching this gutted me. It's a baby AND a primate 😭 I'm soooo happy he's doing okay and is even going to get to be reintroduced to the wild, but this hit so many sensitive areas for my heart and I was not prepared.",2022-06-05 01:47:05

Apes, Dolphins and Whales, Mantarays, Dogs, Horses... if you suggest eatting them most people are ***shocked*** while they eat bacon and pork all day.

Pigs are essentially tied in 4th place as the smartest grouping of species on the planet by most studies, but are one of the most consumed animal protein on the planet.

As a pig owner and former MASSIVE pork consumer, we all need to reflect on how we view our porcine pals in my opinion.",2022-06-05 11:24:31

11ljv2k,🥹 and I bet this kid is his favorite client. Beautiful ❤️,2023-03-08 06:13:23
11ljv2k,"I got in to doing hair by accident kinda. My ex was a master stylist in Charlotte and for months she told me ""you should do hair"". So finally I went down to the school (the same one that she attended) to talk to them just to get her off my case. Well, I started school 3 weeks later. 

I couldn't draw a stick person on paper nor did grow up playing with barbie dolls. So cosmetology never crossed my mild. She told me I have the artistic ability a lot of stylist lack. After a few months, I started to get my foundations down and all my instructors, director of my school, even a few of salon owners kept telling me I had a gift to do hair.  Little did I know, they were all right and I may not be able to draw but I could create works of art with a pair of shears and a comb. Starting out, I couldn't tell you how I even did what I did to get to the finished style but I just was blessed like that. 

Little did I know before I got out of school I had another gift that was right in front of my face and everyone else's and most didn't see it because it's the part of being a stylist that you can't teach. That would be your personality and people skills. At my school we would have groups that would come in from nursing homes, daycare centers, battered women's shelter, etc. My director and most of Mt classmates would refer to me as the 'baby whisper"" or the ""blue hair whisper"" because of how I could calm screaming children and gain the trust of our elderly. 

Like this gentleman in this video, every client is different and your job is to professionally cut and style hair but even more importantly you have to be able to get on your clients level. This barber is a master of his craft. The secret is (in my professional opinion) be genuine.  His smile and laughter is real. If it wasn't from thre heart, the child especially and autistic child would see right through it... and he and his mom would be back at square one. 

Much ❤️",2023-03-08 08:52:18

11ljv2k,"Yes! Sometimes anxiety can be as a result of another condition, but some people have anxiety on its own. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for over 15 years, and only in the last few years I have discovered it is most likely due to untreated ADHD. Since my ADHD diagnosis and treatment, both my anxiety and my depression have gotten a lot more manageable.

Anxiety can be effectively managed with medication and therapy, but many doctors recommend a combination of both. There have also been studies which suggest that lifestyle improvements such as exercise can help with anxiety. If you are struggling with anxiety, I definitely encourage you to seek medical help. It is a hell of a mental illness, and it doesn’t have to be that way.

Getting off my soapbox now! I am not a medical professional, but if you have any questions, I am happy to share my experiences. I am a huge advocate of talking about mental health issues and supporting others who might be struggling with them. ☺️",2023-03-08 14:35:18

13ybhni,"One of my best friends and her roommate both had chemo a few years ago (at the same time), and shaves their heads. I had cancer at the same time but escaped chemo, and I told them I was going to be a lousy friend and hold onto my hair, but if she got a s alp tattoo, I'd think about it. 😁 She did not, but she still loves me.",2023-06-03 01:17:53
13ybhni,"Good to hear your friend got through!

I had cancer in 2004 too, I was 22(F) at the time. It's a deeply emotional moment when your hair starts falling out and you need to shave your head. The memory stays with you.

I would have disliked it if others would have done this, even though I'd appreciate the intention. It would make it about *them*, not me. I know, at that moment, I didn't have any emotional space left. 
I'd hate to have to respond to someone else's gesture in that moment. Having to show gratitude or appreciation for something I didn't ask for. I wouldn't want to be forced to focus on someone else, at a very vulnerable and emotional moment.

Fuck cancer. Scary disease... Spend your time with the people that make you feel good and give you energy! ❤️",2023-06-02 22:39:59

jgd8xu,"My dad wasn't and still isn't like that due to his upbringing. In 21 years I can count on 1 hand how may times I've seen him cry, 3 of which was after his head injury, but that's not to say he hasn't by himself. His mother made them believe emotions like sadness was a sign of weakness and would be beaten if they showed it. When he was 13 his brother was killed and after a week they were told that ""he's gone so stop crying"". He tried his best to show me and my siblings how to show feel emotions while learning it himself but it didn't work. However, he expresses how proud he is of his kids and will express it to anyone. I've been present when he's done it and when you look into his eyes you can see a proud father and although he shows love a little tougher than most fathers, he was and always will be there for his kids when we need him. How he raised us drove all 3 of us to bust our ass and work til we can't anymore and to keep pushing ourselves beyond our comfort zone. I've always said that just because he doesn't ball his eyes out at everything and sometimes let's his mental issues take over I'd never want another man as my father because I wouldn't know what to do with a ""sane"" man as my father lmao 😂😂😂",2020-10-23 08:28:00

zxl0g9,"Reminds me of this time I was coming home from college and not far from my parents’ house I saw a bunch of cars pulled over on the side of a road and people standing looking at something.

I pulled over and there’s two whitetail deer (with antlers) stuck in a wrought iron fence. Someone had already called animal control, but the deer appeared unharmed and we all knew they’d just be shot once animal control or the deputy sheriff decided to show up.

We ended up using a towel I had brought home with me (putting it over their face helps them calm down a LOT) and we were able to pry the bars apart with a car jack. We all worked together to gently push the deer through the fence. 

Once both were out, we used the car Jack again to push the bars back how they were without damaging the fence.

My faith in humanity was restored a bit that day 💕",2022-12-29 05:51:42

zxl0g9,"""I'd like to share a revelation I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with their surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to another area, and you multiply, and you multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague, and we are the cure."" - Agent Smith 🤖",2022-12-29 00:15:05

114w11l,"My one dog is afraid of women. That's the reason my one ex gf is my ex gf 😡. Eventually he started getting anxiety every time I left him home alone with her and it culminated in him growing a pair and standing in my bedroom door way growling and snapping at her because he didn't trust her to be alone with me. Of course she denied any wrongdoing and said he was a ""menace that needs to be put down"". You lived with him his entire puppyhood... dogs don't just turn on people that are actually caring for them for no reason.

 I don't know how people can do that to dogs. I get so mad thinking about it. She seriously thought I would get rid of him (put him down if I had to) for her. Really caused a lot of problems that didn't need to be. That girl is still cockblocking me and I kicked her out like 6 or 7 years ago. It's hard bringing a girl over when your 90lb dog feels like he needs to protect you from them. Aside from my sister/nieces, every girl ive tried to introduce him to is like, ""oh dogs love me trust me."" No. Not this one. And I'm not about to explain why by complaining about my ex when im trying to score. I love him so much though, it's worth all the trouble to have him around. It's not his fault, it's mine for not kicking her out sooner.",2023-02-18 03:21:07

Got to hope there are good people fostering as well. My family fostered kids while I was a kid.  I don't talk to my mom now but she was far from abusive.

a8famu,">No other country spends this much time talking about the Holocaust as much as we do.

Source? I have a study that shows that knowledge about the holocaust is pretty poor in the United States.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/04/12/two-thirds-of-millennials-dont-know-what-auschwitz-is-according-to-study-of-fading-holocaust-knowledge/?noredirect=on

Last I checked, there are tons of WW2 documentaries and movies that explore the vile acts committed by nazis, memorials, etc. Just because the most prominent act of evil by the nazis is committed against the Jews doesn't mean that people don't remember the 70 million that died. There is a difference, for example, with an Allied soldier dying in war as opposed to an ethnic group getting systematically erased due to merely ideology.

>But I guess it takes a genius to know killing is bad, right? 

I was parodying you. It's not propaganda, it's ridiculous to claim it's propaganda. How am I being manipulated? Why are you so upset about people enjoying historical facts? Am I going to find questionable things in your post history?

The first page of your comments already reveals you're an incel, lmao. 

>Democracy is tyranny by majority. Females are the majority of voters. The system is fucked.

Y I K E S. 

>Saying anything negative about wihmyn, even if they're sourced facts, makes you a misogynist. Just like how stating (((they))) own a majority of corporations makes you anti-semitic. Society is such a joke.

I’m of the belief that your daughter (and the children/people like her) *is* a soul that was sent to this earth via you in order to fulfill a purpose far greater than any of us can put into words. I’m not religious but discovered that I’m extremely spiritual only when I became very sick myself and did have a couple of experiences where I was pretty sure I would die, but what I experienced in those moments changed my life in the best way and made me undoubtedly believe that we are all souls living in bodies, here for a/multiple purpose(s). 

Once again, beautiful story—so grateful you shared it. 

I know your message was short and sweet but it seems like you have found comfort since your daughters passing, and I’m sure she’s extremely happy with that—just as she lived while she was on earth with you! Wishing you nothing but the best❤️",2020-07-23 07:50:06

cee5se,"Uhhh, hi I’m Jeff the dude who wrote the tweet. I’ve added stuff to it because people have some questions.

1) I usually wouldn’t shop for supplies at Target but some coworkers let me know about a 15% off discount they were having this week, so I went.

2) Our school has a policy against sending home a list of supplies for students to have their parents buy them. Out of my control.

3) I said no to her offer because we have a fund for supplies through my district. People are mad I didn’t accept her money and use what I saved to splurge on my kids. Well, I can’t. The money is specifically for consumable supplies. She said she was there buying supplies for the refugees in our area and I preferred her spending her money on that. 

4) I didn’t post this to raise a debate so please stop sending me rude Twitter DMs??? I just wanted to show someone being charitable because it made me happy. I wasn’t trying to get people angry, I’m sorry!

5) People are posting that the lowest amount teachers make is 45k so I’m being stingy? Well, let’s just let me say that 45k is not the lowest a teacher makes, I can tell you that from ummmm my own experience. 

6) Despite the budget given, I would be bold enough to say every single teacher in our district still spends out of pocket, and that’s okay. We love our students. 

Have a nice day y’all 💙",2019-07-17 23:15:36

Imagine handing over your money to a group of people in town you thought were preetty upstanding based on the things they said about themselves to get into a position where money would be handed to them and expecting them to do good with it😂 except multiply the scale by x100. 
Hilarious concept, but the norm in this reality.",2019-07-17 17:14:39
cee5se,Funding is lacking for supplies. Also teachers buy extra to help kids whos parents cant afford supplies.  This highlights how committed techers are to their students.

b1spb4,"I would also like to say, to the people that believe he was fleeing instead of trying to overpower the attacker: please read the following. 

In the video, you can see that there are two large exits on either side of the room. Much closer to him and much safer to flee from. Instead, he ran towards a narrow hallway - directly at the shooter. If he was fleeing, he would’ve taken the better option. 

Besides, his son was in that room. Don’t you think a father would’ve tried anything to protect his son? You can see him grab at the gun. Please give praise when it’s due. 🙏🏼

Edit: Thank you to whatever kind stranger gave me gold. I appreciate the gesture :)

9mt7cw,"I personally think if there is a human right to life there's also a human right to die(end this life).

Or as the Germans say ""the dignity of a human is untouchable""

So if I would *want* to die, it would be undignified to *not* let me die.

I always thought it weird and problematic that people can not(ever) choose to die without it beeing considered a mental illness.

I would favor a clinic where people who do not want to life could go to die if they choose to.
Be it a machine that kills you by your touch to release everyone else from the moral dilemma, while providing proper care to the ""leftovers""😧, without causing a public freak out.

Since I come from a societies with moral standard on life, I would probably wish for a psychologist or other form of help and evaluation before we allow Somone into the ""Machine"", especially teenagers who often ""overreact"" in those cases.

I also understand that from a historic/religious point of view suicide of members of the community would weaken the society much more than it would today, we are pointing towards mega cities and more and more people, also anonymity of the individual especially in cities is on the rise, choosing death of certain few would not hurt the society as whole, in most extreme cases it might even help.

But suicide is still a very loaded moral and ethical topic among many, but I can't shake the feeling that with rising numbers of humans and our system of plenty without proper distribution, would ultimately make legal suicide a more and more viable option, as sort of cheap and fast way for the problem to ""fix"" itself, without compromising the system, aswell as twisting the right of personal freedom, to fit this system.

Kind of a dark dystopian turn I took there but 
I just wanted to share my thoughts on that matter and maybe you or someone else have something to add.

dszu9e,"The mother would see me in the elevator and apologize profusely and I’d tell her that it was alright. She’d always refute it wasn’t but then I’d see the boys in the elevator on some days and they’d get shy until I’d break the ice. Knowing I was the dude that was hearing all the stomping and screaming, I think it put things into perspective and it hasn’t been as bad at least a year after we’ve lived here. 😂

I have nephews and we roughhouse and I egg them on to beat on each other as my brother and I did when we were kids. I totally get it.",2019-11-07 16:56:21
dszu9e,"Oh they know. 😉 When I first moved in, the only notion I did once was knock the ceiling with a broom and it died down. She apologized the next time but it kept happening and my wife and I would laugh. I’m gone three or four days out of the week for work and my wife gets home late so it’s usually died down by then. On the weekends or school days it’s apparent. 

We live in a busy part of Brooklyn; our street is a hive of activity where people mainly use it as a way to commute since so many subway lines are accessible. Day in and day out it’s either ambulances, fire trucks or police cars blaring their sirens down our street so you can understand why we’re used to the noise.

But on your end, some people are oblivious to the fact they could be disrupting others. You’re going about it the right why about joking with them (in my opinion), but if it’s truly getting to you, then I’d let them politely know. 🤙",2019-11-07 17:02:39

The pediatrician that saw them explained, it’s when the fever escalates rapidly that causes the seizure. I didn’t know that!!! But otherwise keeping them down with a routine of Tylenol/Motrin did the trick.

My 4 year old did have febrile seizure that because emergent at 18 months. So of course I had to take them in to be sure! But all of this knowledge you health care providers share is very reassuring!! Thank you 🙏🏻",2022-12-10 04:47:49

I was begging my Chinese supervisors to use direct communication with me but that's not how they operate.  🤣

Language wasn't the problem as they were fluent enough, they're just horrendous at communication, even with one another. 

Face gets in the way of empathy as you put it, which leads to a lack of humanity.

Back fur goes up, he starts growling and snarling. It's always someone who looks sketchy and probably is doing something sketchy.

But for that reason I am still very careful about who I let my dog around. At the end of the day he is basically a military weapon. Still, at least 10 people a day want to pet him (half the time without even asking 😑). I let the ones who want to pet him, pet him.

q291tr,"I've never had a bad experience with a pit/pibble/bull terrier/whatever, and the first time I met our family friend's pit (who i love and would absolutely die for this dog) I was a little spooked, just becaue he's jet-black, all muscle, cropped ears (rescue), and he's super twitchy in his movements so he seems really intimidating at first.  What startled me, more than anything, is he immediately barked and did a stomp at me (classic ""friend or foe?"" move for most dogs).  As soon as I called him by name and approached speaking kindly asking if he wanted me to throw his ball, he immediately rolled it at me and was all wags and happy hoppy tippy taps lol 

I can see why nobody would want any trouble with him, he's a little tank and he's very loud for his size, plus you'd never see him or my dog (all black black-lab/Plott Hound mix) in the dark.  Sweetest dogs ever, if you're not trying to break in or mess with any of us, I wish they didn't have such a stigma.  My BL/Plott has more bite strength, and could really tackle and hold someone, ""but her jaws don't lock,"" so that somehow makes her less capable of harm?  Idk it's all whack.

Having dental issues is embarrassing and uncomfortable. Heck I wish I could find someone to take payments. I'm getting closer to 35 with two baby teeth and missing 10 adult tooth buds.

My teeth are all good now, but until the age of 17 I had really severe overbite as well as very little space in my mouth. I would constantly bite into my own gums (behind my upper teeth) and it would bleed quite often. 4 less teeth and 2 years of braces later, I couldn't be happier. :)

(I do think dental health should be universal for everyone, though. I live in a stable country so it was all covered for me. That's not to say this isn't a great act, because it totally is, but at the same time it's pretty dystopian.)",2019-11-28 09:21:33

I hope America sorts itself out when it comes to taking care of the people it sent to overseas hell. I hope that every story, gif, video, song and movie helps towards that cause.

Every time you take them out, say “take a break!” and if they pee, say “good break” and give them a treat and lots of scritches. We even have a special hand signal that means “good job” so they know they’re doing what we want but we don’t accidentally hype them up so much they forget to finish peeing lol.",2020-07-12 16:46:47

vh0phx,"Well, you can’t interfere from the “comfort of your own seat.” If you’re seated, it’s pretty hard to interfere. You have to be standing and reaching over the fence typically (however, literally every stadium is different). If you have front row seats at a basketball game, you can stand and lean out far enough to interfere (it’s happened before).

Also, the idea is to be attentive and aware of what’s going on in the game. Foul balls can kill people, so you need to be aware of what’s going on and how to properly act when the time comes. Now, you might reiterate the “then move everyone back and put up giant fences to protect them, blah blah blah.” You would kill the game if you did this. Baseball is already a slow game for many, and taking out the possibility of snagging a screaming foul ball, catching a legendary home run, or watching your third basemen make a diving catch into the stands would make it so much worse. “Oh look… another ball into the protective glass… how exciting… 🙄”

Now that I think about it, you’re actually arguing exactly why baseball needs this human element: because it’s so unique to baseball. If they lose that, baseball will suffer.

edit: and a side note, there ARE protective nets behind the plate that extend around toward first and third base (not sure how into baseball you are; didn’t want to assume",2022-06-21 16:27:39

If anyone is bored and looking for something to do, there are thousands of children stuck at home with little/no books to read, or live with adulation who are illiterate. Making read-aloud videos would give access to books to so many kiddos right now!

Planing to re-read Harry Potter? Read it out loud and make a voice recording, even if you don’t want to appear in a video yourself. I bet a TON of kids would love to take that journey with you! ☺️

Pick up a calculator and you'll see that it's a better move just to get a trailer and hitch for the daily driver. As you don't need to change the oil/tires/antifreeze or register/insure something that's going to sit most of the year

Anyways a [$500 trailer](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Carry-On-Trailer-4-ft-x-6-ft-Wire-Mesh-Utility-Trailer-with-Ramp-Gate/3013702) hitched to a [Corolla](https://parts.olathetoyota.com/blog/what-corolla-can-tow) can carry similar amounts to a [$28k F150](http://www.kimbercreekford.com/blog/2017-ford-f-150-towing-and-payload-capacities/).

We don’t get over the damage they do to us just because we grow up. That hurt little kid is still inside us deep down. The best we can do is support each other, and make sure that we don’t continue the cycle.

Anyway, here’s a hug, friend. 😊❤️🤗",2021-07-21 16:33:42

ahc6yv,"I remember I was in the hospital, bedridden for two months. My hair became a HUGE KNOT! The nurses were adamant about shaving my hair off and since I was in the coma for the first 3 weeks, I couldn’t say much. My mom refused to have my head shaved even though my hair was literally a ball. When I woke up, my mom spent 3 days unknotting it and then I braided it myself. It saved my hair. I would have been devasted if my hair would have been shaven off. I had two feet of hair😭

vebuc2,"There are definitely insane amounts of “accidents” on the roads in Thailand only 99% of them are completely avoidable.  You oftentimes read of figures like 20-25,000 people killed each year but the real number is likely much higher.  During Songkran Festival (Thai new year/water festival) there thousands killed in that week alone.  It’s no wonder as it’s like one massive water fight where Thais randomly drop barrels of freezing water and ice from overhead bridges onto unsuspecting motorcycles who are busy attempting to avoid the pedestrians with water cannons and the passengers in the rear bed of pickups throwing water balloons full of soapy water and just about anything else they can launch at you 😂). It’s complete idiocy at its best.

In order to understand the high road tolls you need to understand that driving licences can easily be bought, the Theo driving test is easy to pass, even for drivers who aren’t that good as small amounts of cash grease the wheels.

About 95% of Thais are Buddhist so when they get a new car they have it blessed by a monk who scribbles text across the interior roof lining and a dozen or so monk & Buddhist statutes are glued to the dash board, flowers are tied to the steering column and off they go with no regard for anything safety related.  It’s open slather.  You often see pickups travelling at high speed loaded with people and goods which travel at least twice the speed limit often being piloted by Somchai who’s three parts off his face and oblivious to anything other than his high speed trip to wherever.  Often Somchai plows at speed into something killing all and anyone in the area and Thais momentarily stop and utter the Thai words equivalent to, “They had bad luck” before they drop into their drivers seat and attempt to repeat all Somchais mistakes without a second thought 😂

Lots of foreigners die there because they try to apply driving rules where rules are if little concern. 

All said, Thailand and Thais are wonderful, if you survive the driving.  Beware 👍",2022-06-17 21:50:52

Most ""civilized"" folks dont go around judging other cultures as being less ""civilized"" simply because of their traffic rules. It's got that slight hint of almost-kinda-racism just lurking around the corner. No, the comment itself is not racist, but we all kinda know where such thoughts are born - a false sense of superiority.

If they came together downward he would seem angry/annoyed.

vx3uj8,"I feel you. One of my other cats who passed away was very attached to me but i wasnt there when he passed either. (It was him n the other surviving cat left behind but the one attached to me was younger n not good at fighting. Think the other younger cats wounded him badly.. N he died on our little hillside. Our neighbors nanny told us when we got to visit. Our other cat is still alive n is taken care of but he's older now. They dont care for him enough, He's also skinnier.. N now we can't move or fly out n I don't think we can get him. Last saw him before covid when we paid a visit)  

Its a horrible feeling to go your days wondering if they were okay in their final moments and not ever knowing what went through their minds. When we grieve, it's the same deep pit of pain, human or animal. But i do feel like with animals it's just a bit different because you really wonder if they knew or understood your actions or not. And it doesn't matter either way, cuz in the end we couldn't take them with us and it just sucks overall.Even if it was in their own best interest. It just sucks.

I'm sending you all the hugs. ♥",2022-07-13 08:23:26

I went down to Los Angeles from Santa Barbara (roughly 100 miles away) for a concert (rave).

Got there and found out I couldn't get my ticket at will call for some reason and since I was barely 19 I didn't know what to do. Called my mom for help but they wouldn't take a credit card over the phone for a new ticket. I had no credit cards at the time.

So I went back to a booth where you could buy tickets, and came across another guy who was having the same trouble as me. I chatted with him for a couple minutes and he agreed to take a CHECK from me for the price of a ticket.

So he says ""Hey why don't you just come to my place real quick, I live a couple blocks away.""

I (a young healthy man) had no problem with that. So we go to his place, he gives me a bong rip and a microdot of LSD, and paid for my ticket! Gave him a check (it was good) and we went to the show!

I will always remember the kindness and trust of that man. I try to pass it on when I can.

They slip in under the kitchen / garage door and from the backyard french doors when we let the dog out all the time ..  she stands there and then I have to say “In or out , letting all the air out ! “  I swear she is worse than my kids with the doors opening;)  Geckos pay their rent by eating the bugs that make it in ~ moths , mosquitos , spiders, ect.  😊 I’ll take a few lizards/geckos anyday compared to the palmetto bugs that may fly in once in awhile ~ Holy Hot Balls !!!

Completely terrified , wet her dress and the whole backseat of the station wagon .    By the end of summer , I renamed my treehouse , Lizzies Lizard Family Tree .

dllyb0,"Hi there! I’m a therapist at one such place. Regarding the two things you mentioned being nervous about not having:
- phones: you will almost definitely not be allowed to have your phone, **however** you will almost definitely have time and opportunity to contact those you want to. The amount of time and means of doing so varies from place to place, but my hospital allows folks to write down all the numbers they want to keep + to have virtually unlimited time on the unit’s public phone (unless the unit is supposed to be at a group or activity that the patient is skipping, or unless there are others waiting on the phone, in which case there is a 15 minute turn limit)

- knitting: my knowledge of the hobby and tools is limited, but unless maybe it’s like a plastic latch hooking thing and they are very lenient, I’m thinking this one is a definite no. Most places limit the amount of personal items you can keep in your room in general, but as a more specific rule...just assume that they will not allow anything which you could in your wildest dreams imagine being used to hurt yourself or someone else. Shoelaces included. We use special bendy pens and paper clips even. You have no idea the lengths they go to in order to minimize the odds of people getting hurt

Feel free to PM me any questions you have as well. I completely support your interest to take care of yourself + at least figure out if it’s right for you 👍🏼",2019-10-23 02:38:34

11ukwjy,"That’s really sweet. It’s lovely to hear. I’ve heard that Turkey is going through some rocky times right now. I imagine that once they stabilize, their culture will be a generous one. 

When I was working with folks in shelters and living on the streets in Oregon, we crocheted them sleeping pads from plastic bags, packed them kits with everything from contact solution to baby wipes and feminine hygiene products to skin care products and sunscreen. I still worry over the people I met, stayed in contact via email and some social media, when they have access. 

They especially appreciated receiving dog food, doggy cold weather gear and shoes, and meds like paying for vaccines or flea and tick meds (for those that can afford it) because their dogs are their reason for living, their protection, their best friend, their warmth on cold nights. And most of the time they’ve taken in street dogs and given them love and care. They’re doing the public a favor and it just so happens to benefit them too. 

Thanks for taking the time to answer! It was heartwarming. ☺️",2023-03-19 01:10:01

sv405w,"Ok. I work at a restaurant that allows dogs. Most dogs aren't trained. Here's what I've encountered:

They will jump on you, which sucks if you're carrying food.

They will fight other dogs 

They will attack you (95% chihauhaus, but worth mentioning)

They will shit and piss. The owner won't clean it up.

They will try to get food out of your fucking hands.

They will get under foot, and you will trip over them.

Now, I like dogs. But dogs don't belong in a public space when the vast majority of them aren't trained. The most people do is apologize over and over while their dog continously commits the same infractions over and over. These are people who don't know to to train/discipline an animal. Cant people just leave their God damn pets at home for 2 fucking hours?!

1135088,"If it helps, he isn't apologizing, the title is a shit translation. The Turkish text he appears to be signing off on says he is sad he couldn't save one more person, not that he is apologizing for being unable to save another - özür diliyorum is ""I apologize"" which appears nowhere in the image.

It's really bizarre because the first sentence is a completely correct translation. ~~Google translate wouldn't mess the second part up~~, it would translate literal meanings; it's as if someone tried to translate the semantic meaning without knowing Turkish very well. **Edit:** I was wrong, this is just a Google translate job - if you put ""I'm sorry"" it (wrongly, IMO) yields ""üzgünüm"" and when you flip translation directions in the widget it re-translates to ""I am sad"" 😆 then to ""**im**utsuzum"" which is ""I am unhappy"" which after another flip is (wrongly) re-translated to ""I am hopeless"" which is ""**um**utsuzum"", which Google translate finally correctly shows after yet another translation direction flip. So tl;dr Google translate isn't perfect at Turkish/English semantics vs. literals yet.

""Üzgünüm"" (I am sad) is sometimes used ""as"" an apology (99% of the time sarcastically) but that usage doesn't really fit here in that sentence, nor would it make sense to translate it to English that way; you'd go with the literal translation for it to make more sense/actually represent the original intent of the writer.",2023-02-16 00:32:59

This site lists it first, as if it's the preferred translation, again contradictory with other sites (such as the second link you cited that lists it second - that site which btw is super dog shit - it lists başın sağolsun as a synonym for ""I'm sorry"" when it really means ""I'm sorry for your loss"" as in, somebody died! Hardly synonymous, yikes).

Please cite where I said always? I said ""almost always"" (did the italics confuse you? 😆) and ""99% of the time"" but didn't claim it is always used sarcastically. Just heavily. What are your credentials for thinking otherwise? How much Turkish media have you consumed, how many hundreds of hours have you spent in Turkey or among Turkish communities abroad, etc.? I'm confident I have a far better sense of the modern Turkish vernacular than you do, especially as it relates to English translation.",2023-02-17 20:45:37

And [here they are as of Thursday](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/ie0b30/fk_these_pants/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) when I brought them to work with me to be dewormed. Happy playful brave little stinkers 😻

Of course I don’t post the ones with sad endings but seeing the kittens everyday reminds me why I do what I do :)",2020-08-23 06:26:29

Those kittens are so cute! Do you know what caused their blindness? I have a blind cat myself (she has eyes but they don't work unfortunately) - I've always wanted to know why she's blind but don't think I'll ever find out.

Thank you for doing what you do ❤️",2020-08-23 09:11:21

ieqmd4,"Yeah this lady disgusted me, she heard of our rescue but didn’t even try to rehome him, her excuse was “they are already full!” Yeah we’re full when people are trying to dump their kittens on us but not when it comes to directly saving a life. They already had the hole dug for him that’s how serious she was she said. She seemed genuinely happy to be taking his life, almost vengeful. Also get this - her name is Karen, no joke 😳

The kittens mother was blind as well so we assume it’s hereditary as every one of them were blind. [I have a blind kitty also](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingDerps/comments/ien6kx/what_is_this_evil_creature/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) at home and hers was caused by feline herpes as a kitten",2020-08-23 10:51:07

ozwyj6,"Hi fellow tribal person. I'm Kenyan of the Agíkúyú tribe.

For many, the bracelet is simply a sign of Kenyan pride but if you look at when it first became popular, it gives it a little more significance.
 

First, the bracelet is made with [Maasai beads](https://www.google.com/search?q=Maasai+beads&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjx8YHLzKPyAhUlmIsKHX5tBjMQ2-cCegQIABAC&oq=Maasai+beads&gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQAzIECAAQQzIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQ6BAgAEA1QykVYnVRglmFoAXAAeACAAbYCiAG5BZIBBzAuMy4wLjGYAQCgAQHAAQE&sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img&ei=hvEQYfGWFqWwrgT-2pmYAw&bih=786&biw=412&client=ms-android-samsung-gn-rev1&prmd=ivmn) in the style of the Kenyan flag 🇰🇪 and helps to support local craftsmanship. 

It is a sign of patriotism (not nationalism) to the land we share with 55+ other tribes. The bracelet is a reminder to me and to all who wear it that we are proud to be Kenyan. In Kenya, tribal and ethnic identities have been used to divide us esp in politics and in 2007, we almost fell into a civil war - a tragedy we see all around us. We started wearing this bracelet as a show of 'Peace, Love and Unity', the Kenyan mantra, and to show that we are as much Kenyan as we are our tribe. Today, almost every Kenyan wears it. 

Many Kenyans are protective of the bracelet and only give it to someone we love or has 'Kenyan qualities' such as kindness, honour and respect.

Fun fact: Timothy Cheruiyot is of the Kalenjin tribe and in his tribe, they give you a leather pouch full of traditional medicine or a drink called [Mursik](https://www.google.com/search?q=mursik&oq=mursik&aqs=chrome..69i57j46i175i199i512j0i512j46i175i199i512j0i271.1410j0j9&client=ms-android-samsung-gn-rev1&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8) as a sign of togetherness and welcome. Sounds like you have something in common with this great athlete.",2021-08-09 09:35:16

“This platypus, renowned as one of the few mammals that lay eggs, also is one of only a few venomous mammals. The males can deliver a mega-sting that causes immediate, excruciating pain, like hundreds of hornet stings, leaving victims incapacitated for weeks.”

“Equipped with sharp stingers on the heels of its hind feet, the male platypus can deliver a strong toxic blow to any approaching foe.”

“Platypus venom disrupts haemostasis (blood regulation), cell membranes, and nociception (pain regulation) to cause nausea, swelling, and excruciating “whole-body” pain that lasts for weeks in humans and cannot be alleviated by morphine.”

You can technically feed just hay but it would have to be a lot and you'd have to worry about minerals too. I'm sorry they told you that and were an AH about it. Hay/forage is really important for their digestive systems. Honestly a lot of 'pet' people (and even professionals like vets) just don't know crap about rabbits. Some say only pellets. Some say no pellets. I just do what's worked for me over the years and 100s of bunnies (I showed for a long time and now have a few around just as pets mainly) lol",2023-03-11 15:01:11

iiquzl,"It’s hard to find the right words, but being there for her is helpful. It’s a horrific journey to be on, and sometimes the meds have to take make it even more depressing. But my number one support was my family, having them there to cry with me or me pat my back or calm me down was everything. 

Send your mom a big hug for me. And never forget no ones journey is the same, she may have the same thing but she may be more fortunate. Blessings to you and your family ❤️❤️",2020-08-29 17:58:23

I can't even begin to imagine what its like to go through a situation like what they went through, having to hide/flee or face going to concentration camps, being separated from family, torture, and for so many, an inevitable death. & to think that this all happened within a short enough time span for these 2 men to still be alive.

ilud3p,Adding to this discussion. Our base pay for teachers is 30k I believe. Looking at the sliding scale etc. getting your masters in addition to a bachelors gives you 5k more a year on average. Is that really worth it? The schools in Utah are a joke. But sure that 5k a year may cover part of your student loans 😂,2020-09-03 23:49:20

Personally I would exclude something like planned parenthood in the same way your comment seeks to exclude churches, and yet that would not be fair to how someone chooses to be charitable.

The act of giving the resources away is the charitable act, where they go is just getting into the weeds. At least that's how I choose to interpret such things, from a position generous to both sides.",2022-08-28 19:04:14

s307dr,"Incase anyone is curious: 

This looks to be a hatchling loggerhead turtle. They're endangered because of things such as light pollution, retreating beaches as well as the survival odds of reaching adulthood being roughly 1000:1. 

As lots of people say, they should crawl a distance (roughly 12m) to the water to imprint the location for when they come to lay their own eggs. However, if the turtle is found hatching during the day its already very dangerous as they dry out very fast (the yolk and nutrients from their egg sustain them for their first week of life so they don't need to forage/hunt immediately). 

All in all, yeah if you're in this situation the best practice is to dig a trench about 12m long, put the hatchling in the trench and shade it as it travels towards the water. If it looks weak already then putting it straight in the water is the best course of action. Ideally if you have a turtle conservation company nearby give them a ring and they'd love to help! 

Source: This summer I volunteered to help monitor and look after loggerhead turtles in Kefalonia in Greece. Any questions are welcome ☺️

s307dr,"Turtle conservationist here 👋🏻 Agreed about getting them to the sea and the hot Sun.  The only point I came to make here is that if possible, try not to touch them on the bottom of their shell.  Hold them by the sides when moving them to the beach.  The under side of a baby turtle shell is soft like a human baby’s fontanelle, and chemicals from bug spray, sunscreen, lotion etc can seep into their shells.",2022-01-13 19:50:59

s307dr,Awww ☺️ little waddling little turtle baby,2022-06-26 02:42:01
s307dr,"Raise it until it’s at least six months old! Putting it in the ocean now is a death sentence! I volunteered at a sea turtle rescue in Indonesia. That’s what we did and why. Crabs, seagulls and all kinds of marine life will have it for a snack. This person just wanted to film themselves for ‘likes’. 🙄",2022-07-01 10:20:41
s307dr,Omg I was in Zakynthos in 2014 working with Archelon! I was coming to say the exact same thing😂,2022-01-13 19:24:14
s307dr,Wildlife Sense? 😊,2022-01-13 21:36:41
s307dr,I watched a presentation by Kefalonia and we visited a nest beach. I bought a T Shirt too lol.  As a Consultant Ecologist in Scotland I was very jealous of the volunteers spending the summer on the beautiful Greek islands while I was staying up all night doing bat surveys in the rain 😂,2022-01-14 09:47:37
s307dr,You are an beautiful human ❤,2022-01-13 20:50:52
s307dr,"So basically when they hatch the way they find their way to the sea is by the moonlight reflecting off the water. Manmade light such as: beach bars, street lamps, floodlights, even headtorches with white light, all of these emulate the moonlight for the turtles. 

When they try to follow the light they then go the wrong way and become disoriented. When we monitored the beaches at night we used red light head torches as the red light doesn't have the same effect ☺️",2022-01-13 16:40:45
s307dr,"I just came home from Sal Island, Cape Verde. I found loads of dried dead loggerhead babies on Kite Beach. ☹️ Supposedly the light from the new hotels fools them.

I talked to a marine biologist there and at least the have some people there when they hatch.

In Cape Verde all the stray dogs pose another problem for the turtles.",2022-01-13 20:02:23
s307dr,You can always go somewhere to volunteer for a bit ☺️ I live in the UK but Greece was open in Covid for me to go.,2022-01-13 19:04:19
s307dr,So for me it was really straightforward. Where abouts are you based? Europe or elsewhere? ☺️,2022-01-13 20:07:28
s307dr,"I initially looked through Plan My Gap year, they do lots of volunteering projects for wildlife and humanitarianism etc. I ended up with a company called WildlifeSense which I can't recommend enough ☺️",2022-01-13 21:00:44
s307dr,Haha I was wondering when the AC references would come in! 😅 Unfortunately I didn't but I did visit a few places that were in the game! We had most of the day to ourselves after morning shifts so I saw a few of the ruins etc in the game which was cool!,2022-01-14 08:45:08
s307dr,"Just doing what I can to help ☺️ So the best way with a trench is to dig it and then get wet sand to place along the base so it keeps them cool and then shading them. If they look really weak then straight to the water is best, it's better to save them than it is to let them dry out in the name of letting them walk the 12m. In terms of food I unfortunately don't know how they learn what to eat but they certainly figure it out!",2022-01-13 19:03:14
s307dr,Yeah they were really brilliant 😋,2022-01-13 21:38:29
s307dr,"Haha trust me it wasn't completely altruistic! I'd had a really shit breakup and then I had a few months when I quit my old job and had to wait to start my new one so it was only booked last minute!

Most people do think it's really cool though and it's a privilage I had the opportunity to go and experience it ☺️",2022-01-14 01:00:21
s307dr,"I 100% recommend anyone to go do something like this it was really amazing. However the credit should go to the people running the conservation, I did good stuff but also spent the summer lying in a hammock drinking beer and chilling😅 They're the ones who put their lives into it",2022-01-14 18:31:54
s307dr,They have quite a large weight variety around the region of 100kg 😋,2022-05-07 22:20:10
s307dr,"Haha, I'm sure they wouldn't appreciate it too much 😂",2022-01-13 19:03:32
s307dr,I'm actually not 100% sure. When they're adults they can hold their breaths for around 40 mins. When they're first in the water we watch to see if they surface 3 times and take 3 breaths to ensure they're strong enough to go ☺️,2022-01-13 18:01:41
s307dr,Some cities require special glass that limits transmission at night along beachfront construction. I call it turtle glass🐢,2022-01-13 18:48:35
s307dr,"Very interesting thank you for sharing! That's cool, it is also correlational though so we might find they use a combination of effects or something. Such as needing time to imprint the magnetic signature as they travel or something, no real idea just theorising! Good find though ☺️",2022-01-13 17:18:01
s307dr,Thank you 😊,2022-01-13 23:19:57
s307dr,Wow. I did not know the odds were that bad. Thank you so much for rescuing them😊,2022-01-13 23:55:04

s307dr,"Well shit I'm looking at hatchling pics and it looks very similar. Even that butt shaped bump on its head is exactly the same.

This could actually be video proof of illegal activity 😲",2022-01-14 07:18:34
s307dr,Yeah.. I saw some absolutely heartbreaking video once of baby sea turtles trying to cross a road at night because of the light. So many where laying dead and crushed in the road 😭,2022-01-13 19:07:20
s307dr,"Yeah you're totally right, they have a combination of size and grace. Definitely personality too 😅 They are an animal I'd barely heard of before but they're really really special",2022-01-14 00:57:30
s307dr,No worries ☺️,2022-01-13 16:49:40
s307dr,Yeah it was really cool ☺️ Quite intense with early starts etc but it was really worth it,2022-01-13 20:27:37
s307dr,"Haha I didn't realise how big of a deal it was until I went out there to be fair, I thought I was just going to be filling in a clipboard all day! 😅",2022-01-14 00:05:46
s307dr,"Pretty good from what I could tell, I presume that they took the scans from the modern environment then overlayed back to then so it was like being there 😋",2022-01-14 13:06:05
s307dr,They get to around 3 feet but the largest ever recorded was about 9 feet if I remember correctly 😋,2022-05-08 11:06:12
s307dr,"> The weak ones also need to die and get eaten by seagulls. If there were a bunch of weaker turtles in the breeding pool because people helped them, no turtles soon.

Doing 5 insane surgeries on a human newborn to fix horrid birth defects that would've left it dead in a week: 😊

s307dr,Oh that's really cool thank you for sharing! ☺️ Feel the turtles had a bit of a shock though 😅,2022-01-13 17:43:28
s307dr,Yeah Greece was lovely for it. I am ginger though so a bit of sunburn happened 😅,2022-01-13 19:36:39

dct3kr,"Been watching Juan’s for the last week. This video is obviously awesome but his other videos are mostly of him just confidently walking up to girls with an opening line, making some decent convo and small talk, then getting their numbers. He makes it look SO easy. Guy excludes confidence. Since watching though I’ve decided to give 3 woman a day that I see in public a compliment in person. Overall it’s been an overwhelmingly great experience especially after having used tinder for years. I’m not bad with women but I wouldn’t say I’m a Casanova either. I can already see changes in my confidence level when approaching and speaking to them. I highly suggest it! Doesn’t have to be creepy but just give a genuine nice compliment and you’ll be surprised how far you get 👍🏽 thanks Juan!",2019-10-03 19:36:15

9s2cbw,"Exactly! Y'all can't just tell every single woman that standing up for herself solves anything - I'm 5' tall and was pretty skinny when I was younger, and not physically fit or trained in anything. 

I tried to stand up to my ex, and every time, shit got crazier. It went from words, to shoving, to throwing me around, to choking (not the fun kind 😨). Escalated to him straight up beating me anywhere there weren't outsiders. As in, he'd beat me right in front of his parents.

r4uha1,"One time I was going up an escalator at a mall in Madrid, and I absentmindedly watched this kid play with the brush-like things near the edges as we went up. My eyes caught an emergency stop button and I briefly had a passing thought of, “oh, it’s nice that there’s easy access for when something happens.”

Lo and behold, as the kid reaches the end, his hand? Sleeve? Got caught and he started shouting and crying hard. All the people around him needed time to figure out what was going on or what to do, but for me, without even thinking, a split second, I put my hand on the emergency button, and it was over as soon as it happened, before the parents were even fully aware what was happening.

Apart from the kid screaming his lungs out in trauma he was totally fine. Then I walked away without thanks.

I totally forgot about this until i saw this video. Looking back, it feels weird/serendipitous/fated that I would have had that prior passing thought about the button and taken notice of that kid playing, when normally i’m such an absent-minded person. I like to think i was there for a reason that day. 😎",2021-12-10 12:25:29

yx3rsw,🤯,2022-11-17 04:41:16
yx3rsw,"Damn I thought it was going to be pulled out the other end 😳 also plastics aren’t necessarily the problem, it’s littering. And it’s single use plastics, cheap materials so people don’t have to use one water bottle and just refill it. I definitely think this issue is about consumerism and not one particular material. Though it is an issue that plastics are difficult to recycle. Recycling is actually a bit of a myth, I’m curious if aluminum and glass can be recycled more easily and more completely than plastic. But I also think that recycling expends energy, we should be supporting food warehouses where you bring your own bags and bottles. Not grocery stores that literally throw out perfectly good food and wrapping all the time.",2022-11-17 04:43:31

ylyxhe,these birds — specifically the snowy plover — are the reason i’m alive today. my closest friend told me this quote which is “bird by bird.” my favorite bird is the snowy plover because they’re so adorable. i kept telling myself “bird by bird” and it’s gotten me through the worst days of my life. i plan on getting a sleeve on my arm to cover my scars. i love you forever snowy plovers! 💛💛💛,2022-11-05 03:41:26

ylyxhe,"Unfortunately it's not just laziness. My cat came to me from the outdoors (legit just showed up at my house one day) and he was indoor/outdoor for a bit, and I am now trying to transition to keeping him indoors, and it has been a disaster considering he's basically a barn cat. I have a harness and leash for him but he freaks out when wearing it, despite wanting nothing but to be outdoors. 

I'm hoping with practice he'll get used to it, but for now I have to deal with his excessive meowing and running around intentionally destroying things because he's not getting his way 🥲",2022-11-04 20:21:06

jxdsfv,"What she say ?

Edit: it was a she

Edit2: this is what she said:

> Thank you to everyone for your beautiful comments ❤  Mairead (pictured above) is 12-years-old with congestive heart failure and hemangiosarcoma of the spleen (and infiltrating her lungs). The past week has been very hard, but she is rallying and is such a beautiful little trooper.\
\
When I messaged the Town of Bancroft this morning asking if you had snow, I felt like a crazy dog mom. Instead of being passed off or ignored, I was met with compassion and a photo of a backyard covered in snow, with a note to come soon as it was warming up. We packed up our little girl for what might be her last road trip in her favourite Jeep and we got moving!\
\
Not only did we get her to her beloved snow for a roll and some puppy snow angels, we took her to Eagle's Nest as she is a woods girl at heart, and although we didn't make it very far to see the sights, she loved the woods and the beautiful rock cuts.\
\
Thank you so much for being such a compassionate (and snowy!) town and for making my wish for her come true. Winter is her absolute favourite time of year, and with the mild weather here in Quinte, I don't think she would have had the opportunity to see it if not for Bancroft area. \
\
This is her at Eagle's Nest enjoying the beautiful forest ❤ She still has so much gumption and we intend on making her last moments the very best that we can.

Final edit:  Thank you very much u/CandyyPiink for the award. Today I spent most of my day playing around with my dog, and although she is only 6y/o, you just never know. Take care everyone <3",2020-11-20 02:02:40

i'd be so happy, friend!

the ice cold wetness i'd adore

a bit of time to spend...

so many years of snowy fun -

the slipping sliding play!

perhaps a chance, a final one 

to in a snow drift lay...

a quiet walk thru woods we'd go -

my very favorite part!

i'll leave my pawprints in the snow

Hearing this, I told my clerk to add his total to my fees. It felt good.

Did it again at the grocery store last year. I was the second in line and the elderly person in front of me had trouble to pay with his card (his bank had an outage with debit card) and had no money. All he bought was essentials. I told the clerk to add his bill (amounted to about $30) to my total. Felt good again 🙂

So far, in over 30 years of driving, no speeding tickets. Fingers crossed 🤞, knock on wood and all that.",2020-11-27 00:34:38

kgza2r,"Being recognized by the community more than out weighs the bullshit you deal with at work, especially this time of year. Gives the strength to keep going when the time home is virtually nil, and the time delivering to those at home is your entire world. It’s so heartwarming to know that someone noticed. 

To all the delivery people I know - You got this! You are in the home stretch! Breath and know that PEOPLE DEPEND ON YOU!

To figure out what makes a big difference in the life of someone you love, shoulder that burden day in and day out, foregoing your own immediate gratification to provide something like this?  Wow!  THAT'S AMAZING LOVE!

There are people, men and women alike, who complain, ""Men don't say 'I Love You' enough."" That is true in some cases.  But this is how a real man says I LOVE YOU.  With actions.  With his whole being.  The words just cap it off 😉

Any ways I had really nice dress Sandals fully strapped around ankles and no high heel or anything. Very comfy and easy to remove going through security. Somehow I managed to wedge my shoe under the metal corners of the stairs and completely broke my shoe off tumbling down the stairs on my ass. No one looked, helped, asked if I was ok or anything. I was surrounded by a bustling airport literally flooded with people. So that was my intro to London people lol. I tried to look at it in a good light like maybe they just didn’t want to embarrass me by recognizing it happened but I know if I was home in America someone would have at least asked if I was ok etc. I was extremely embarrassed especially since most were on my next connecting flight 🤦🏼‍♀️.

My flight departure gate wasn’t announced until 10 minutes before boarding was to begin because they couldn’t find an available gate. Talk about stressed! Luckily for me the gate they picked wasn’t too far or as you know it could have easily been a 15 minute tram ride or walk since the airport is so huge!!!

One time I left my backpack with my laptop on a city rail system. By the time I realized, it was long gone. I was very sad because my laptop had several college papers that were in progress that I had to start over, in addition to struggling to find money to buy a new laptop. I also had a bottle of medication that I needed daily. Needless to say, it was a big mess-up on my part to lose it all. Anyways, a week or two passed and I had just gotten a new laptop and was getting it set up when I got a phone call from my pharmacy. Apparently a homeless man found it, found the bottle of pills inside and walked to the pharmacy’s address (miles away, not on the rail line) that was on the bottle and had them call me to let me know he found it. I was absolutely astounded. We met up and he gave everything back but apologized that he ate the bag of chips that were in the bag. 😭 I gave him a stack of gift cards to various food places in the area as a thank you. Sometime people are really, really good. ",2019-02-17 19:46:50

After 7 phone calls to different hotels and still no joy, i rang a number I found on the business card. A man answered who was Spanish speaking I’m Irish so that didn’t work out to well, he kept hanging up and was quite annoyed with me I heard “puta Madre” which I know is not a nice phrase. So the next morning I decided to ring the bank that issued the credit card. Turns out he had the card cancelled. The bank got in contact with him and I met the man in a bar and returned the wallet. Turns out he was on holiday with his wife and grandson and was over the moon that I returned the wallet.

Then I get this message on Facebook from a random guy saying he found my backpack at a station. Apparently he’s with lost and found but was trying to track me down faster.

r0gtma,"I’m sorry. It can be so hard. 

Here, they probably got advice from a specialist. In my experience they are more pragmatic than the family vet (I’ve ignored specialist advice as well with support from my vet).

Also, this was a stroke, which can have better outcomes compared to cancer and other health/painful situations.

Overall, Vets will err on the side of the pet instead of the human because that’s their role.

Please know, it’s always a hard decision (too late/too soon??). And although it’s really difficult and incredibly sad each time, I’ve always been grateful our pets have had this option. 

I hope a new friend will brighten your days in the near future ❤️",2021-11-24 04:41:39

What if we planted a tree above every grave and organized them like wildlife areas or something with trails.

12ch5r1,"I’m only arguing your point about golf being exclusive to people that can afford a country club… which is a wild statement. 

Sprinkler water can come from a variety of sources depending on the area. I live in a spot that often has droughts. 60% of courses here use non-potable or secondary water. Still nothing compared to animal (mostly cows) agriculture. The original comment was about “importance” of something. I would argue that golf, a game that makes people happy, is just as “important” as eating burgers and steaks.

e197a8,"My dad passed 5 years ago from esophagus cancer, compared to other people his battle with cancer wasn’t much of a battle and was very short, within 4 months he was diagnosed and passed. 

As far as suggestions/regrets/advice:

I regret every single aspect of how I handled the entire situation, if I could go back and change it I would do literally anything and I have to hold that guilt inside of me for the rest of my life, it’s not pleasant. 

Be there for him, keep him company, spend as much time as you can, if you haven’t always had a perfect relationship find the time to apologize for wrongdoings, play games/watch shows/whatever is his favourite. 

I’m not sure how active your dad is able to be in his condition but just do whatever you can with him while you can. Make sure he knows you love him. 

Good luck ❤️",2019-11-25 05:23:59
e197a8,"When my dad passed I only had 1 recording of him, which was his final palliative care chat before going on to the really strong pain killers. I can't bring myself to listen to it even though I so desperately want to head his voice again.

I even tried his voicemail to see if he had a viable piece audio I could save for our family.

Bottomine record anything your dad will let you. Him reading a news article, a poem or a story for your kids (Hallmark have books for this too if you want to get fancy)

I'm training to become a biographer in order to offer this service, such was the impact my own loss had on me.

Record his thoughts on life, ask him about key life events. First memories of banal things can often yield amazing stories and are less confronting than asking about First Love or Regrets.

Let him know you'll be ok. Send him off knowing you got this, and then just enjoy your time with him.

So sorry, but be sure to focus on doing what you can now. You can grieve later, knowing you squeezed out every last drop of shared experience will spare you so much regret later. Knowing you did all you could is enough to keep the worst at bay.

Be sure to find out about advance care planning and his thoughts on that too, that's less fun, but taking that burden from him if you can is one hell of a departing gift.

vrdhsq,"This is a very interesting philosophical dilemma, because one could argue that even if those influencers are *virtue signalling*, a good deed is still done regardless of the intent. 

The intent is wrong but the outcome is fine. You'll realise that some ethics and religions, that are [deontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology#:~:text=In%20moral%20philosophy%2C%20deontological%20ethics,the%20consequences%20of%20the%20action.), say that the action is wrong and hence it is wrong to do it regardless of whether that beggar got new clothes before winter, as you took advantage of their plight for your benefit in front of a camera. 

Meanwhile, [Consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) says that you can't tell if the act is right or wrong until you see the outcome. That influencer was being a selfish dick, but in the end the beggar is more equipped for winter, which is much greater than whatever temporary shame the influencer brought upon by sharing to the whole world about their plight while taking advantage of it to gain likes. 

There's a third type, [virtue ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics), that says it depends on the doer's character, not just intent but the personality and that good actions are only possible by people with good ethics (virtues), while the same actions are malformed when done by people of bad ethics (vices). So here you would say the influencer lacks magminity (to help others), truthfulness (resorting to lie to the audience to get points) and modesty (having to brag to viewers that they are doing good) 

#---------

It's interesting because now it raises a question, are the virtue signalling phonies still doing good? 

If you thought it ends here, then nope it goes further, I'd argue to even economics

#---------

Another good example is a rich person who donates to an hospital and build a new specialist ward, in exchange for being bumped up an organ wait list - corrupt and unfair to those who rightfully waited in a just manner, potentially robbing their lives. But at the same time the new specialist ward might result in lots more folks being able to receive better treatment over the next few dacades and potentially escape death / diminished living

#-----------

Here we see the classic economics ethical dilemma. Kinda like the trolley problem. Should economics take the utilitarian approach and conclude that this is good because in the end there are more lives saved, albeit with an opportunity cost amounting to that few folks in the organ list who got bumped down (**concequentialism**) 

Or

Should there be some kind of humanitarian factor that concludes that the act of malice itself by unfairly costing the lives of those on the list, is far far costly, regardless of whatever future benefits it may bring (**deontological**)

Or

The rich person held the wrong values of selfishness when paying the kickback to build the ward, hence it is wrong, while if they had the good ethics of selflessness and instead wanted to sponsor the ward out of 0 malice and 100% goodwill, and then as a result got gifted by the hospital the chance of jumping the list, then maybe it will be OK

#---------


Back to the virtue signaling. If humans being bros are due to said humans feeling good after being selfless, is that person secretly being selfish? 

Selfish altruism, we as social animals feel good and want to be altruitic because our ancestors did that and survived ss a community, while the selfish ones who didn't naturally feel good about being altruistic ended up eventually, over generations, dying.

So if it is selfish to want to sit and eat well and feel good regardless of the plight of others, are we truly altruistic or just being bros because we feel good, **and is that ok?** 

#--------

wanting to help not because you genuinely care for others but you just feel good knowing you can make someone else better.

Compare this again with

wanting to help not because you genuinely care for others but you want to show you care and gain support and acknowledgement from others

#----------

So, are we all humans being bros? Or not? 🤔

I don't want to answer it, but I also don't want you to feel it is a pessimistic criticism of mankind, because no one said the ethical norms can't coexist, and no one said selfish altruism is bad, and also no one said that all forms of selfishness are the same. So it's really just to make you wonder how we would judge someone, or **whether we should judge the character, the act or the outcome**",2022-07-04 23:17:21

11umjgf,"I actually swam in the ocean with stingrays in the Grand Caymen Islands, or maybe Jamaica? I don't remember which trip it was but it was this excursion you take a bus from the hotel to a boat and the boat takes you out in the ocean a lil bit and you just jump in and they give you food and you feed and pet the wild(but slightly domesticated?) sting rays. Of course they give you lots of warnings and instructions on what to do and what not to do. But tbh it was one of the coolest experiences/memories I've ever had.  It was surreal combined with the crystal clear water the white sand and sun shining/glistening off the water and the shoreline with palm trees and foliage looking like something out of a travel magazine. Unreal. Would still do it again today if they have it. But also RIP Steve 🙏 he was dope af. Miss seeing his shows and his energy he brought to everything he did. He had a pure passion for what he did and you could sooo tell. Thats awesome to see in and of itself. Not many people are that bright of a shining person with an aura that draws ppl in like he had.

When the rays swim to the middle of their tank you can't reach them, so they can get away from our hands if they want.

I don't know much, but some of the smaller rays seem to like pets. I was petting one, and when I stopped to move on it kept following me along the side of the tank until I kept petting it. 

A larger one did that to my mom once too and it splashed her when she tried to leave 😂

I hope the domesticated sea flap flaps like the pets, and I hope the aquarium stops things if they seem bothered",2023-04-25 07:37:04

i.e. ever heard the story of the scorpion & frog? A scorpion asks a frog to carry him over a river. The frog is afraid of being stung, but the scorpion argues that if it did so, both would sink and the scorpion would drown. The frog then agrees, but midway across the river the scorpion does indeed sting the frog, dooming them both. When asked why, the scorpion points out that this is its nature.

Its not in the stingrays best interest to sting this man nor does he probably even care too atm. But it doesnt mean he will be able to help himself 🤷‍♀️

i3hcnc,"I get it, but, to me he sounds disingenuous when he “compliments”. My assumption is so that he can film it and post it on social media for fake internet points. I believe in complimenting someone if you want! I do it all the time. When your compliment consists of “I like your shirt” it doesn’t reflect the qualities of a person. It just a statement. For example “I liked your shirt, it’s fire 🔥” sounds bland and not personal. “That shirt really looks good on you. Blue definitely agrees with your skin tone!” is maybe a little more personal and flattering. Also I don’t know why the font changed.",2020-08-04 21:29:38

i3hcnc,"It’s my favorite pastime and my secret superpower. I have more than once given such a targeted compliment that the person cried. I try to find something they’ve obviously put effort into and then be very specific about it. 

I made a bank teller cry until she had to take a break because I complemented how perfectly executed her eyebrows were that day. 

I feel like it’s important to note that my love language is words of affirmation 🤣

---

i'm not sure what happened, but something so strange,

and Everything i've ever known here has changed...

the humans were fleeing, they said to help others,

as i stayed behind with my animal brothers 

but it was my puppies who needed me More!

I just couldn't rest to their safety was sure

they all cuddled close, 'cause they needed their mom,

n i tried my best  to keep Everyone calm...

but so much was gone as i watched the smoke clear -

i counted each pup - thank God they were all here!

i searched for my humans, but new friends arrived

so Loving n caring - i knew help arrived!

now all that i want is my family near,

n when they return

i'll be waiting 

right here....

❤️

101loxr,">*’My antlers hurt…*’

______

‘twas a week after Christmas, when i lost my way,

i dropped from the reigns when returning the sleigh

the others flew off - i could see them all go,

i fell to the ground, n was buried in snow!

but then - *Prancer Saw me!* I saw him drop, too

*’Hang on, dear friend Vixen! I’m waiting for You!*’

n then,  out of nowhere,  the humans appeared

they yelled *’Keep your Head up - we’re Friends!*’ as they neared

they pulled on my antlers with all of their might,

Prancer looked on - i knew i’d be all right!

determined to free me from my snowy grave,

the Kindness of friends is what kept me so brave

at last they succeeded! i wobbled away,

a lesson was learned on that cold snowy day

when things look the darkest there’s Hope if you find

the love of a Friend

who won’t leave you

behind

k4ukzy,"Being kind has nothing to do with your pocket money, bank balance or income level. Kindness is carrying a box upstairs as you introduce yourself to a new neighbor moving in. Kindness is looking the homeless panhandler in the eye, asking how they're doing, wishing them a prosperous day - whether you give him money or not. Kindness is offering to hold and quiet the crying baby so his exhausted new mother doesn't also begin to cry as she unloads and pays for her groceries. Generosity is a form of kindness, yes, and is often assumed to be financial. However, generosity can be extended in many forms. Fortunately, humans universally need generosity of heart, spirit, time and energy   far more often and in much higher amounts than that of financial currency 💞",2020-12-02 12:27:14

k4ukzy,"Going to the cinema in the UK is quite expensive, and the sweets/ popcorn / fizzy drink stand is so bloody expensive it’s criminal. So, when my boys were young we would go with our own snacks and drinks. My bag (security reasons) was searched and our treats were confiscated until after the film. My sons were so sad, it made me cry for days. My husband emailed the cinemas head office THREE times, and wrote two letters - he heard nothing back. We never went back to that cinema, it’s still there and apparently the prices are still murderously high. Greedy sods. 😥",2020-12-02 03:09:45

10urbg9,"yes, sadly. birds have cloaca, so their eggs and waste come out of the same place. egg bound birds get the passage blocked, so the waste builds up and they can get sepsis. they can also just die from exhaustion of trying and failing to pass the egg(s).

Their daddy always fixes things for them. This approach DOES NOT work with those types.

Tbh I never even thought I'd get to this point because I can't even afford to go to the doctor let alone buy musical equipment, but now suddenly Instagram wants to monetize my reels so... Now I just gotta learn how to use GarageBand 😩😵‍💫

But yea, I gotta say, us neurodivergent kids tend to be pretty artistic. If we actually had the resources you'd probably see a lot more autistic musicians. People with ADHD also tend to thrive in more chaotic environments like the music industry.",2022-12-29 20:34:17

zybyve,"Because I can’t upvote a thousand times, I had to comment so I could say that I, too, had musical talent but had my love for it and confidence in it stolen as a child. Your story isn’t exactly like mine, but close enough, I think. I get it. I know the empty space in your life where it should be, and I know how it feels to wonder what it might have become. The ways life might have been different as a result. 

My other love/talent was also writing, and luckily that was actually nurtured — at least a little. Not enough that I wrote the great American novel, but enough for me to be able to use that talent to help others with theirs in a way I absolutely love.

I’ve just recently started an attempt to take up piano playing again (I’m 45), and it’s … great, but so frustrating. I have to be proud of myself for playing the simplest things when I already KNOW what it feels like to REALLY play. It’s a part of me I thought was dead, and I hope it’s not. I guess I’ll find out.

Whatever you do, good luck to you. I’m sorry that your candle got snuffed out so early by careless adults who should have been encouraging you. Your young heart couldn’t sort this stuff out, but your grown mind can. Your talents were and are important and valuable. No one is there to “punish” you with them now. You are in control. Do what you love and do it well, and make sure to tell anyone who doesn’t like it that they’re more than welcome to fuck right off. ❤️",2022-12-30 11:01:45

If we want true justice *in time for it to actually matter*, we need to act *in time for it to actually matter*. Unfortunately, following the rules of justice altered and molded by those people will result in no actual justice occurring in time for it to actually matter, but at least our headstones will read ""We were civilized to the end!"" 👍

Humanity *is* for the most part beautiful, and part of that beauty is wanting to be civilized. However, everything is a poison depending on the dosage. There is a time to be civilized, and there is a time to save ourselves.",2022-01-05 23:46:15

nc4cl0,"Aaagh, no, what the hell, where did this net come from? ⭐",2021-05-14 12:57:12
nc4cl0,"Median net income in France in 2018, per month, was 1871 euros according to the National institute for statistic and economic studies, which is a branch of the Government in charge of publishing statistics about economy, population, … etc : https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4990766 And that’s in EQTP, meaning it’s if everybody with a part time job was having a full time job paying the same hourly wage, which artificially increases the number. 3776 euros per month is the 9th decile, meaning 10% of people earn more than that. At 3000 euros she should be in the 8th decile, so somewhere between the top 20 and 10% (she can’t be higher than top 10% nor lower than top 20%)

Edit: you seriously thought that half French people made more than 3800 euros a month?????? 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Second edit : even if you were talking in revenue before taxes for the social security, which I wasn’t, according to the world renowned economist Thomas Piketty, in his book « pour une révolution fiscale » (« for a fiscal revolution ») in which he scrutinized wealth inequality in France and how the fiscal system adressed it, a 46k euros before taxes in France would put you in the top 10% of earners. Even if you were talking in income before YOUR BOSS pays taxes on you, 46k euros would still be in the top 26% of income. Those are 2012 figures but I highly doubt they would have risen that much in less that ten years, especially considering that as I said she told this to me years ago. You can check those numbers on an old website he made in 2012 : https://www.revolution-fiscale.fr/simuler/distrib/ According to his simulator, and considering a 3000 euros after taxes roughly translates to 3800 euros before taxes in the French system according to another simulator I found online, such an income would actually put her closer to the top 10% than 20% and is coherent with my evaluation.

az1j9x,"So dumb 🤣

My dad always said if I couldn't sit still ""I can belt your arm to chair, or I can just belt you. Your choice."" 

Lot more efficient than guy in the gif!",2019-03-09 09:44:46
az1j9x,What is this reference? 😂 I see it all the time,2019-03-09 13:39:56
az1j9x,"We have tried that as well, and all it does is make him want to do is cut our hair then gets mad when we go back to him 😂. I appreciate your comment, unfortunately I’ve tried sooooo many things. He has gotten somewhat better with things over time, but it’s a very long (years sometimes) grueling process for him to do and/or be comfortable doing many many things that other kids his age have zero problems with.  One day at a time!",2019-03-10 02:00:58
az1j9x,"Thank you, honestly 💜",2019-03-09 17:06:09
az1j9x,"Thank you for noticing. I take pride in the fact that I have no empathy for these people and even more in the fact I don’t have brats running around all day crying about getting their hair cut. To me, all I see is undisciplined children and bad parenting.  It’s much easier to say your child has a “disorder” and let it run around a restaurant or place of business screaming and disrupting civilized people’s days than it is to actually step up and discipline your child to act appropriately in public. But still, these parents won’t do a damned thing and they’ll expect the rest of the world to cater to their child’s “special needs” and call the rest of us who don’t insensitive. 🙄 It’s sad and funny all at the same time. ",2019-03-09 20:15:41
az1j9x,"That’s a good question. Maybe? But knowing me, I’d have a secondary meltdown from the headphones being too tight or getting sweaty. 😬 I might have to give it a shot though. I didn’t find out that I had an APD until midway through my junior year of college so I haven’t really had the opportunity to test out different solutions just yet",2019-03-09 13:33:16
az1j9x,"That’s interesting.. my son also used to chew, but on ends of blankets when he was a toddler. Now that I think about it the clapping may have been his replacement for the chewing because at the time he didn’t clap. I completely agree that people should be more accepting/understanding of the situation and I try to get other adults in his life to see it that way. Kids on the other hand are usually pretty merciless 😑",2019-03-10 16:38:31
az1j9x,Hey thank you that’s really nice to hear! Honestly I feel like it’s an uphill battle everyday and that I am failing them in some way. I think that may just be part of being a parent in general much less when you have a child with special needs. But again thank you it means a lot to hear positive feedback even if it’s from someone online! 😊,2019-03-10 06:09:20

96p7vj,"Seriously. My dog (he's mine for 1 year while my best friend and his wife, original owners, are out of the country for work and thankfully he already knew me very well. Transition was way better than I expected!) Was born at a high kill shelter in Tennessee and taken away from there when he was about 4 or 5 months old at which point my friends adopted him.

I have no proof of course, but just by how affectionate he was with my friends, and how loving he is now with me, I feel like he knows how much worse his life was. 

He's not even 2 years old yet so it wouldn't surprise me if he remembers the place he was born. Maybe it's just wishful thinking but I like to think he knows how much better of a life he has with my friends and me. He can be a little stinker sometimes but he's such a goofy sweetheart😊",2018-08-12 15:37:08

My dog went from walking on the knuckles of her back feet and falling when attempting to toilet, to long and happy walks just like she used to.

Edit: never mind. Someone mentioned his Instagram name down below. If you just Google Wolfgang2242 they all come up. 
Guess he was heartbroken by the loss of his beloved dog so decided to adopt an old dog from the shelter so something good would come out of it. Then it just snowballed from there! Is he EVER an angel!!! ",2018-08-12 15:25:25

Neighbor down the street died and he had a bunch of outdoor cats he was feeding. His kids gathered up all the cats except the scrawny cross-eyed drooly cat. After three days I claimed him.

Every weekend she holds an event where homeless people can get haircuts and makeovers for free and of course she is handing out food + hygiene products daily. If you've ever wanted to donate to a charity but don't want to give it to some huge multi million charity that will pocket donations for the ceo or something, then Shirley is a very trust worthy source. She goes on live every time she donates so you can literally see her handing stuff out. She used to post videos of herself going to Costco to buy the supplies but I haven't seen her do it in awhile. Anyway Shirley is an amazing person and if I ever have kids I hope that they'll have a fraction of the empathy and kindness this woman has ❤️",2022-11-27 03:33:30

Maybe the extreme trauma of being unsure of survival day to day pushes them to act out. Either way, the unpleasant have as many rights as the pleasant.

We were on our way home from shopping and my son knew I had cash and was upset that I lied to the man and didn't want to help him. I had to explain to him, ""I'm a woman alone in the car with my son. It's not safe for me to roll the window down for strangers"". He understood (as much as a 5yo could) but he was upset the whole way home and I felt like such a dick, regardless 😭",2022-11-27 01:24:12

Well, I had my time with lots of anxiety and such, back in 2020. Well, to tell one of my experiences, I have a ps4, and I was playing Journey (a short game which was given away for free that time). It was just about a little being that had to go on a journey to be reborn after reaching the end. Well, when I finished it, I bursted into tears, because I felt like that little being was finally free and I, too, wanted to be free.

9vobwi,I’ve had some first hand experience with this. My dad had a liver transplant about 10 years ago and there have been some real behavior and personality changes. His liver really loves to curse. My mom and I kind of refer to him as two people - him and his liver. Not scientific but 🤷‍♀️ I believe it,2018-11-10 01:58:47

kekm4x,"As an Aussie living in the US, I'm so happy someone else made this comparison. 

I always say ""New Zealand is our Canada in every possible way"". And what I mean by that is -- sure, Australia tends to be more involved in broader world discussions, and we are never left off maps and such (except Tassie). But NZ is straight up more progressive than Australia -- their infrastructure moves faster (beat us to fiber optic internet for instance), their laws move faster (also beat us to gay marriage), and they're just more chilled out, more polite, more tolerant people than we are. A lot of that is due to population and land difficulties (much like US vs Canada), but most of it is the slight cultural differences we have. And we have really strong bilateral relations with one another (again, like US and Canada).

In fact, almost every stereotype of US vs Canada that I can think of would also apply to Australia vs NZ as well. 

So if anyone was going to try and out-Canada Canada, it should probably be NZ. After all, Australia seems to be trying to out-US the US these days. 🙃",2020-12-17 07:33:14

I disagree, I think that little boy died exactly where he wanted to. After working in hospice for many years, I’ve seen people surprise you in when/where they ultimately die.

When my dad died of ALS last year, my mom (a retired hospice nurse) and his hospice nurse said he had weeks to days left. I felt it in my bones that he was going that day, because my husband was going back to our home 1800 miles away the next morning. My dad really loved him, and my husband has a healthcare background so was helping with bed bathing and the stuff my dad didn’t want his daughters to have to do (and my mom couldn’t do alone.)

iob03s,"Thank you. :)

Your words just made me think of another story when it comes to all creatures great and small. 

For a while my dad was gathering all the lawn clippings in a pile behind the garage, with plans to eventually move the pile back to the field behind our house for burning (with our neighbor’s permission). When it came time to move the pile, it had gotten pretty big and he was using a pitchfork to load it into a wheelbarrow. He had almost reached the ground when all of the sudden, dozens of tiny garter snakes scattered and quickly slithered to the overgrown grass of the field! He realized he’d disturbed the nest of a family with babies and felt completely awful about it, but of course he couldn’t really do anything at that point. But as he finished moving the pile, he was extra careful because he didn’t want to hurt any that might still be hiding. 

He was still working in the yard a few hours later when a fully-grown garter snake slithered over to where the pile used to be. It had a very enlarged spot in it’s belly, so he assumed it was the momma snake; either she had just eaten a mouse, or she was very pregnant! And the part that really got to him was that Momma Snake stood up (well, as best as a snake can) *and actually looked him up and down* as if to say, “what did you do to my house?” A few minutes later she slithered away and into the field, in the same general direction her babies had gone. 

Whenever we had to rescue a garter from our window wells after that, I’d wonder if it was one of Momma Snake’s descendants. 🐍",2020-09-08 00:07:37

I once thought I’d found some tiny tadpoles in the ditch, and scooped them up to put in our old aquarium. When my dad came home from work, he informed me that they were in fact tumblers. 

Oops. 

I promptly emptied out that aquarium in the back yard.",2020-09-07 23:35:51

tkczxi,"Yes, but a volleyball spike that touches a player is a point, even if it's out. You seem quite simple so I'll try and find a comparable that you can comprehend. Baseball perhaps?

A runner on first base tries to steal second, the catcher throws the ball from the plate to second base, the second baseman catches and and goes for the tag while the runner slides for the base while the second baseman goes for the tag. 

There are two cheating scenarios presented (you may want to find a grown up to help here):

1) The second baseman catches the ball and tags the runner before he touches the base but the umpire calls safe.  Ethics demand the runner say ""Nah, he got me""

2) The second baseman misses the tag and the runner slides in safely but the umpire calls him out. Ethics demand the second baseman says ""Actually, I never touched him""

Omission of either of these confessions is cheating. It is unethical sportsmanship. You can get away with it sure, but it cheapens the game and takes away the benefits of true athletic competition.

Once again, I posit the reason you have such a hard time comprehending this most basic of concepts shows that either you have never competed in true athletic endeavours, or you are a dirty unethical cheater.

Good day sir.

akzgvi,"I have an amazing story too:

I once lost my phone while walking through fields and forests of the village, to which my SO and I had just moved to (lost it on a path through the country side). 

The people whose land it was found it, when the went there to cut the grass and tend to the field. (it was by the side of the path and must have fallen out of my pocket into the soft grass, so I didn’t notice). The son found it and gave it to his mum to try to track me down.

She scrolled through my contacts and found an entry „Mum and Dad HOME“. The lady thought that sounded promising. But my speakers had broken the previous month (so I always did calls with a handset). She of course didn’t know that.

So this lady and my mum were on the phone 📞 Saying „hello“ with my mother hearing the woman perfectly but the Good Samaritan not hearing my mum.

My mother hung up and texted from her own cell phone: „M. what’s up with your phone? I can’t hear you. Mum“. The Good Samaritan read the sms, knew my name now and that she had indeed found my mum. 

She then proceeded to  text my mother from my phone, explaining what the situation was and my mum wrote down her name and address and contacted my SO with all the info. Turns out: The family only lived 3 min from where I live and were locals for generations. :-D.

SO and I went by that evening with a bottle of wine. Such a nice family. They were rightly proud of their detective work!

It led to a new acquaintance in the village we had only lived in for a short time, and in the end I became their daughter‘s French Tutor for a few months ;-). 

Am still so grateful to that family!!!


Another story:

- I was robbed in the city I now work, during a commotion around trams (I was getting out), but someone saw it, lunged at the robber and grabbed my wallet and handed it too me and then got into the tram. All in seconds. The robber ran off, the HERO got on the tram. I could never do more than mouth „thank you“ over and over and bow, as he drove off.... I would have loved to buy him a drink! But he seemed like a humble and shy person. He’s still my hero! I was pretty shaken after (for a while). 

I in return once yelled at a person who got money from the ATM, retrieved her card but NOT THE MONEY (she seemed in a hurry). She wouldn’t stop thanking me. If I ever found a wallet, keys or phone, I’d drop them off at the next police station or try to find the person.",2019-01-29 19:57:26

99572b,"Metal show have the most wholesome atmosphere. You're all there as one big family and you help anyone and everyone out and include anyone and everyone that wants to be included. I have never felt more at home and safe than at a metal concert. I'm a very small female and love to mosh, I always get knocked over and what not and people always help protect me and pick me up right away. Metal family for life 🤘",2018-08-22 04:07:36
99572b,This is so sweet . I love this . God bless ! 💕,2018-08-22 12:17:05
99572b,"My first mosh pit experience was similar - I was 16, watching Green Day at Leeds Festival in 2001 with a friend who was 13. It was our first festival. We were completely freaked out by the crowds and I fell over, my friend fell on me, and due to people pushing I couldn't get back up (my friend did though). A nice girl helped me up and guided us both out behind her. I remember I kept stepping on her baggy trousers and I know I tore them at one point. Once we were out of the way and she'd made sure we were alright she went back to her friends. I am forever grateful to her.

I do have a slight fear of crowds and crowded places now though. At gigs I stand near the back, and if someone so much as brushes past me I jump out of my skin. 😣",2018-08-21 22:10:10
99572b,"In my first circle pit, there was a bit of a jam-up and I went down. Knees hit but before my hands made contact I was scruffed and pulled up from the floor like a kitten. The (giant) kind man that saved me from trampling was super chill and we hung out a bit, as he said that I clearly seemed intent on getting trampled. He was awesome. I imagine he is saving young women from stampedes at punk shows even now 😊",2018-08-21 22:28:44

99572b,"Had mine knocked off my face in a moshpit and proceeded to catch them, I'm proud of it 😅",2018-08-22 02:39:25
99572b,"I'm pretty light for a 6' dude, I was even lighter when I went to my first concert. The first time I fell, the grass had turned into mud because security was spraying the pit with a fire house, so I slipped mid run and slid and knocked over probably like ten people like bowling pins, when I finally came to a stop, I just felt hands all over and I was thrown as high in the air as when I did when I was a kid, I looked over the entire concert for like a second and hit the ground running. That's when I learned metal concerts are a great crowd 👌I almost threw up.",2018-08-22 01:52:22
99572b,I've been getting really into the reggae scene the past few years and that's a owefext amount of chill and energetic for me. Not metal related I know but if we're talking about genres and their crowds 🤷🏻‍♂️,2018-08-21 21:00:20
99572b,"Another big metalhead, my most played artist on Spotify is Grimes 🤷🏼‍♂️ ",2018-08-21 22:40:05
99572b,"I've had the same thought. While all those genres have their emotionally evocative elements, there's a very cerebral component to understanding how everything fits together as far as rhythms, melodies/harmonies, and overall structure that takes a bit of work to decipher.

I think the people that enjoy finding those patterns in music are, generally, drawn to things they don't immediately understand and figuring them out. It makes sense that this trait would lead someone to a broader world-view with a more complete understanding of all the components that contribute to things being the way they are and, therefore, being more at peace.

Definitely heavy speculation but interesting to think about at least. 😊 ",2018-08-21 22:59:05

When he was holding it upside by its legs was surely a trigger even for him to stop filming his mate struggle and to just fcuking help instead! The next time he's in a stressful, anxious situation and there's some passerby, who instead of joining in and immediately helping him ASAP... they just get their phone out and stand there filming it all to save and share the video of him to anyone and everyone who happen to come across it... 🤔🙄🤨😒",2021-09-22 01:08:05

psj1un,"I love oh so much old mate helped the sheep get unstuck.
However my first thought was the sheep is external to that fence.. did she come from another paddock? 😅 Maybe a neighbour feud could ensue cause of a mistaken stolen sheep..

Also old mate was struggling with putting the sheep back over the fence by himself... Ha but for the sake for the old camera footage he does it alone... Not get a hand from the cameraman. Haha I guess I'm too oldskool to just get the job done. If it gets caught on camera, bonus..  ha but I'm not the type to post vids either...

yxyubk,I once was late to a class in university. In the middle of the lecture I heard a big yawn. I was visibly confused because I naturally thought it was one of the students and I was looking around. Someone saw my face and pointed at the huge dog napping on the floor right next to the teacher’s desk. The dogs were huge and they were all casually going in and out of classrooms sometimes when they wanted pets. Everyone would pet them silently and the dogs would go to the next person in the row😂 Only amazing thing about living in Turkey for me.,2022-11-18 07:40:43
yxyubk,"Morocco is like that too. I was at an outdoor cafe in Tangiers, and I was slipping a local cat some of my food under the table, trying to be discreet about it bc in a lot of places, business owners don’t like it when you feed surrounding animals or strays bc they’re seen as a pest. But more and more cats kept showing up at this cafe, like maybe 20 cats slowly converged over the course of about 15 mins. Then a waiter brought out water bowls for them and a couple minutes later a fish monger pushes his cart up. The cats all run to it, and he throws each one their own little fish. It must be a daily ritual, bc clearly these cats knew he was coming and were waiting. And there I was worried about slipping one cat some table scraps 😂",2022-11-18 01:19:40

Loved seeing this note and knowing you got these little glimpses of her pre-dementia self after years of seeing only her dementia shell. 

My dad lived with my family for 5 years, and we lost him two years ago this week at 95. His dementia worsened over that time, but I just loved having him close and doing things with him every day. I love that my kids got to see how we treat people we love when they need help.

You did one of the most difficult jobs that exists, and clearly you were great at it. Knowing well the difficulty level of the undertaking, I’m completely impressed at how long you took care of your mum.

I’m so sorry for the loss of your nonna it’s heartbreaking. The story with ""her father"" is beautiful even if it’s very sad, she was happy. ❤️ I’m glad it offers you comfort.

I just found it yesterday but it’s just so perfect. My mom and I went no contact (again) after I asked her to please not text me constantly talking horribly about my dad. But instead she text bombed me with like 10 texts telling me how horrible I am and I’m a POS. Like ok whatever 🤷‍♀️. I honestly can’t love more what she wrote cause it’s so perfectly her.

Edit: love it more! Cause that’s totally my mom",2021-08-03 02:19:01

This!! I love this!

Sadly I've only ever had this once. Where they did it off their own back.

Usually don't say anything. Or can't as it's so loud etc.

At a festival once. My pal who was a couple inches taller and I were stood watching a band play.  There was two tall guys stood behind us. But patches of space all around as we weren't exactly close because I can't see anything close.

They moved. From just behind us. To directly in front of us.  Their view pretty much the exact same.  But meaning my pal and I now couldn't see at all. 

I'd had a few drinks.  Tapped their backs nand called them out for it in a jovial sorta way. And said if you just stood two footsteps to the left or right... They'd not have completely blocked our view?  They were cool about it and apologised and said they hadn't even thought!  And moved over a bit 😁

I even had it at the circus once.  Sat in a row of sit anywhere in your zone seating area.  With my son and two very small relatives.  A man came with his kids and sat in the row in front of us. So the big tall guy about 6 ft tall sat directly in front of the 5 year old with us. Meaning she couldn't see a thing.  Even with tiered seating. And many many other seats available with same view.   Whereas if he sat in front of one of the 2 adults in my group. He'd also not have blocked the view of a child.  We got up and moved seats. 

Wish folk would just take in their surroundings a little and just think of others more...",2019-04-29 10:29:14

ah4wce,"They're not getting paid because our lawmakers didn't pass a budget to ensure they do (meanwhile, on the last budget, they made sure to allocate money so that THEY get paid).

Congress is the one with the power to allocate money 🤷🏻‍♂️ and unfortunately, the Senate Majority Leader will not allow a vote on any of the budgets the House already passed.

And our President already stated he will not pass a budget without funding for a wall. I believe he even stated we SHOULDN'T pay them during this shutdown because it would lower his chances of being able to get this dumb wall.

Honestly, the only thing you can point to in order to blame the Democrats for not giving in and letting Trump have what he wants.

And the American People don't even want a wall. Even the people who live near the border do not want it. Fox News, a news station that's biased in favor of the wall, even showed a poll that showed 42% Support, 54% Opposed. Yes, that's pretty close, but the support isn't even high enough to warrant a Shutdown. What about 70% Support for Medicare for All? 71% for a $15 Minimum Wage? 61% to end the war in Afghanistan? 91% for Universal Background Checks? If we're going to shut down the government over something, how about something that the people actually want?

e8evvr,"My mom has been donating crocheted blankets to sick children over the past 20+ years. In total she has made 49 afghans this year, 45 of which she just donated to Jersey Shore Medical Hospital’s Pediatric and Pediatric ICU wards (her 5th year donating to them). She has probably donated over 1000 blankets to those in need at this point in her lifetime and she’s not stopping anytime soon! 😊

I wanted to show her some appreciation from internet strangers since only a handful of people see her work on Facebook and Instagram and she rarely gets thank you notes (which we understand as parents with sick children have enough to be worried about). She has also been discouraged in the past as she’s had issues with blankets being given to children and their families who are not seriously sick (i.e. in the hospital for a night for fluids) to blankets being given away all at once at a holiday party to people who were never patients.

Overall, my mom is a machine who has been crocheting for 52 years and is self taught. From preemie blankets to veteran lap blankets to charity auction blankets, if you find her a pattern she can make it!

edit: Thank you for the Platinum Award stranger! Also here is a [link] to her Flickr page if anyone is interested in seeing better pictures of her blankets. Thanks again reddit!

edit 2: Thank you for the awards everyone! And for everyone asking if they can donate supplies, yarn, etc. my mom just asks for you to pay it forward.

edit 3: Just posting this here since I have gotten multiple questions regarding commissions. Depending on the pattern, blankets start at $125 (depending on the complexity of the pattern) + shipping for a blanket that is 48"" x 60"" (size can be changed). She requires a 50% non-refundable deposit up front. I know they are not cheap but they are heirloom-quality and the money goes towards making more blankets for donation. Let me know if you are interested or want additional information. Thank you for your consideration!",2019-12-09 19:44:58

13lknhs,Or defending China 😶,2023-05-19 16:59:31
13lknhs,"I just don’t get this “he made contact with his face that’s flagrant.” calls 🤷‍♂️ 

I grew up in a time when a flagrant foul was an intentional foul. Something done maliciously. What D’lo did wasn’t malicious at all. It was a basketball play which happened to end up with the backside of his arm contacting the offensive players chin. He was going for the ball. He wasn’t trying to intentionally injury the offensive player. 

These types of calls are ruining the game. It’s a contact sport, after all. People will accidentally get hit at times but it doesn’t warrant more than foul shots. 

Hachimura got hit in the head a while later after the D’lo play and it was a much harder head hit but was completely ignored. 

Everyone talks about how great the 90s was for basketball but then are okay with all the ticky tack shit called today and okay with flagrant fouls being called for someone making a basketball play. 

Now get off my lawn",2023-05-19 21:35:48

11hsl95,"My boyfriend did this with me, twice!!! I had brain surgery in 2020 and my hair was down to my butt. He chopped it off, shaved it bald, then automatically shaved his! I had surgeries again in 2022, and he did the same thing with no hesitation. My first surgeries took about 22 days. He slept on the hospital futon every night so that I wouldn’t be there alone!

Edit: I got an award!!! I had actually seized again very recently lol. I was in an awful mood, but the award made me feel better 😊",2023-03-04 15:42:05
11hsl95,"My partner had cancer and she was a hairdresser, we talked about her getting her head shaved as she was starting to lose it. Me being the great boyfriend said ""I'm going to shave my head if you are"". Her reply was, "" don't be fucking stupid, one of us looking like a twat is enough"", she had a great sense of humour 🤣🤣. Sadly she lost her life to the fucker that is cancer 7 years ago, still miss her like crazy",2023-03-04 12:22:34
11hsl95,"While I love and support this so much I just wanted to add a laugh for those who might need it.

I would be less than thrilled if my fiance shaved his head in support of me having to with cancer. Not because I don't appreciate it.

My fiance and I are the exact same height. He is like 1/2 an inch taller. We are the same skin color. We have similar body sizes, though he is more muscle and triangle shaped, and I'm more hour glass designed.

When we wear hoods up, people often mistake one of us for the other. And honestly I don't wanna deal with being mistaken for him for a few months. 😂😂",2023-03-04 14:22:08

11hsl95,"Not saying this is… but I wonder how many of these are fake. 

Who records themselves shaving their head? Especially when you have nice hair still!

I went through chemo as a kid. Wore a hat everywhere when my hair got patchy. Didn’t shave til one day a guy took off my hat 🧢 because I was inside a building and it was “disrespect” to have my hat on. He felt bad but my parents decided it was prob time to shave my head. That’s when I realized I had a pretty funny shaped head 😂 

But I or my family would have never recorded my head shave process. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",2023-03-04 18:50:06

11hsl95,"I have tried to explain on other threads similar to this that the notion of other people shaving their heads in solidarity isn't always comforting to the patient, and people get angry when I say it.

As a cancer survivor, my response was very similar to yours. While I understand the gesture is meant to be a comforting one, it can also highlight that you have a choice to shave your head, while I did not, and that your hair will grow back, while mine didn't (permanent chemotherapy-induced alopecia). My husband and son both wanted to shave their heads when I shaved mine, and I begged them not to.

I think the point is that while it's obviously a very sweet and caring impulse, anyone contemplating doing this should probably talk to the patient first and make sure it's something that will comfort them instead of upsetting them.

I'm sorry to hear you had to make this decision so young. It's so unfair 💖",2023-03-04 12:35:16

11hsl95,"You’re making too many assumptions when it comes to their motivations. What if sharing it fulfills them? What if helping break down stigmatic walls appeals to them? Of course, you could be right about what you said, but that is only one possibility. We don’t know these people, so any concrete speculation about their motives seems, at least according to my values, premature. 

I don’t think the video OP posted is a good example of the societal observation you just described. However, I do agree with the observation. In fact I couldn’t agree more. I think it’s spot on. Especially the last sentence. If you experience reality, and no one is there to witness it or take a photo of it, are you really experiencing reality? 😆",2023-03-05 08:12:51

gs7foc,"A little off topic but you reminded me of an experience in I had in high school. Being the youngest of five children meant that most of my clothing was hand-me-downs from my older sisters, and that my parents weren’t big on shopping the “name” brands. When I started high school in a fairly wealthy area ( I came from the not wealthy part of town), I was teased a lot for my out of style and “knock off” clothing. Some of the popular girls just called me Wal-Mart or K-Mart when they would address me. Most of the teasing occurred after school on the bus ride home. 

I remember one instance in particular, I had been wearing a black fleece jacket and boots from Aeropostale. One of the girls on the bus said something like “oh ante and Sarah are twins today!” because Sarah had been wearing a black North Face and Uggs. (Yes I went to high school at the start of the basic bitch era)

Another snotty girl retorted “Except Sarah’s clothes are real and ante’s cost probably 5 dollars total” and they all laughed and went back to ignoring me. I was the last stop of the bus, so once everyone else got off and it was just my brother and I, I silently cried in my seat. I was excited so excited to wear that outfit that day, aside from some jeans, they were the only new items of clothing I owned and I was happy to “fit in”. Those girls completely ripped that feeling away.

Anyway, my bus driver witnessed the whole thing and my tears. She witnessed it every time. She always said “hang in there kiddo” as I got off the bus after the girls were rude. She was always so nice to me. But that day, before getting off, she said “hey you’re about my daughter’s size. She has a bunch of clothes she’s getting rid of after cleaning out her closet. Tons of stuff with the tags still on. Would you like me to bring them in for you? It will be our little secret!” I said that would be cool and the following Monday, as I was getting off the bus, she handed me a GIANT bag of clothing from Victoria’s Secret Pink, Abercrombie, Nike, and Vineyard Vines. It even had a small Coach wristlet and a bunch of VS body sprays and lotions. Everything fit like a glove and I was so excited, I wore those clothes so proudly to school. She gave me three more bags full of clothing, shoes and accessories over the next few months. Basically a bag for every season so I had warm and cool weather clothes to wear. 

My parents and I thought the gesture was unbelievably kind and wanted to do something nice for her. The bullying about my clothes and being poor had stopped completely because of her sharing her daughter’s clothes with me.

So my mom reached out to a friend of hers in the school district and asked about getting a gift for the bus driver, seeing if she had any suggestions because she knew the woman very well.

Turns out my bus driver didn’t have a daughter, or any kids at all. She was just sick of seeing some heartbroken kid every day get teased over something so futile and used her own money to help me out. She turned down all gifts and money offers from my parents, but accepted a home-cooked meal with us around the start of the new school year. Her and my mom are still friends 11 years later and I still am eternally grateful for her extreme gesture! ❤️",2020-05-28 18:37:37

a3rqvb,"When I was fifteen, me and my then best friend were going to throw a huge sweet sixteen together. Her birthday was in February, mine is in August, so we were going to do it in May to meet in the middle. 
We put a lot of plans into it, we picked a theme, invited everyone we knew. Two weeks before the party, friend decides that she doesn’t want to split the party and just to do it on her own. 

She had my guest list, my theme, and my plans. She stole my sweet sixteen. I was really upset, and didn’t want to throw a party at all. So my birthday in August rolls around and I have no party or anything planned. I just planned to go grab dinner with a different friend(named Cass) and then hang out at her place. Turns out, she was planned a huge surprise party with all the girls from our soccer team. There was a theme and music and like 20 people and it was so much fun. That was the kindest, most selfless thing someone has ever done for me. 

2019 will mark 12 years of friendship with Cass. I’m her maid of honor in her wedding this May. I am so grateful for her, and the beautiful friendship she cultivated with me when we were kids. Love you, Cass. ❤️

c828ar,Haha. Touché. 👌🏻,2019-07-02 03:58:48
c828ar,"You've gotten some great answers, but I'll give you my 2 cents anyways. 


First to be pedantic, while calling it fibrillation is technically correct, a better term is cardiac arrest. You could be in V-fib (ventricular fibrillation), which is the shock-able rhythm where the heart is ""quivering"" but not effectively pumping, but what caused it is typically under the umbrella of cardiac arrest, which means heart no go boom boom. 



Now to the actual question. 


So in a car crash, unless the person gets out on their own it's best to leave them in the vehicle UNLESS there is a more pressing matter. It all comes down to the lesser of the evils. Ultimately, C-spine protection doesnt matter if the heart isnt going boom boom (the patient wont be alive to appreciate the use of their limbs), so at that point it's best to get them out and provide high quality CPR and let the doctors worry about the other stuff later. It's why they get paid the big bucks anyways! 😂



Most of the ""split second"" decision making in the field comes down to picking the lesser of the 2 evils, so to speak.",2019-07-02 12:45:17

w5zw89,"It’s common in other countries too, like Indonesia and to some extent countries in Africa snd the Middle East, only in parts of the Middle East they actually go out of their way to hurt the dogs.  Thai people don’t do that.

Don’t get me started on Vietnam and the various people around that support the dog meat trade and the incredibly cruel transportation methods.

I live abroad and still support the soi dogs at my home, I make sure my family is still feeding them.

Thailand needs a govt led program to sterilise the soi dogs, if you could somehow sterilise the dogs quickly the problem would resolve itself but that would require too much action by too many people that would honestly believe they are interfering in something that they shouldn’t be.  It’s a headache.

I use to ride my bike in the evenings, looking for the skinniest dogs to feed from a bag of pork off cuts and trying to deal with the injured dogs is very difficult as most vets are happy to treat if you pay for it but few are willing to put a dog down, it’s very traumatic.

Two young guys behind reception, like 16/17. Their English wasn’t great and my German is non-existent so when I had to ask for an iron they were both very confused. 

I was pointing at my shirt and thinking of different names for an iron to see if something would click with one of them, so I said ‘A press, a clothes press’ 

“Ahhh, ahhhh - we will, to the room”

20 mins later, he arrived my room with a cafetière.

Work for your room, bitch. The probation officer demanded you go somewhere though, to get out of going back to jail for simple possession. And it is technically better than being locked in jail.

It sucked, I bought that big bowl from a thrift shop for my very first apartment when I moved out of my parents' house shortly after high school, and followed me through my adult life, through my engagement, marriage, birth and life of our son, our divorce, and an international move to Europe and back to the US, many many bowls of popcorn during movie nights, and countless Halloweens, and this year some butthole decided to steal it after having it for 17 years.

Wasn't worth much, it was just a big cheap hard plastic bowl, but the feeling of someone thinking that was okay to do on a holiday that's meant to be fun for kids is just crappy and not a fun thing to discover when I got back from trick or treating with my kid around our neighborhood.

qsndfk,"So just FYI — I work for USPS, and they go crazyyyy on us about bringing Amazon/Fedex/UPS packages that are put in USPS Resident mailboxes back to the Post Office. Depending how petty your mail carrier is, some carriers will actually bring your package back to the Post Office. From there, we then bill and charge Amazon/UPS/FedEx for placing the package in our USPS mailbox since “it’s a federal box and it’s designated for resident letter mail only.” 
From there, the post office bills and charges Amazon/FedEx/UPs for it being placed in the mailbox, USPS will then actually wait for them to come make a special pick up for it which ends up delaying the package quite a bit!! 

Again, just depends on your mail carrier. 

(Last thing I’m doing is bringing any shit back with me for more work at the Post Office, besides we all want our packages regardless of where it comes from. )

Just thought I’d pass this fun fact along!
Be nice to your mail carrier we don’t all suck!! 😬❤️",2021-11-13 01:36:54

qsndfk,"Yeah! Absolutely! 
They make lock boxes for packages. You can put out a wood box. A plastic container. You can tape a sign on your front door that says “put my fucking packages under my doormat” 
As long as letter mail and your packages can be separated. Letter mail has to go into a protected covered mailbox. Packages can go on porch or a separate bin, and any delivery company is able to put packages in that bin. 😬",2021-11-13 02:14:23
qsndfk,"I'm not American so I don't know what it's like over there. Remember that video recently of the boy almost taking the package, and then realising he was being recorded and saying are you home? There's a package here! 😂

It reminded me of that video. Asking first before taking it protects you in case there is clear CCTV. 

For me personally, if I wanted I would just ring the doorbell and walk away. If they're in they'd answer and pick it up, if not it would be left outside either way. I wouldn't need to know if they are in or if there is CCTV unless I considered taking it",2021-11-13 01:12:41

o7obu6,Actually did know this. My friend went to a turtle sanctuary for turtles that wouldn’t survive in the wild and one of the poor turtles was dropped on its back which broke its shell and as you know it’s spine also so it lost all control of its lower half. Because the shell cracked it allowed air into the shell so it can’t even fully submerge anymore 😢,2021-06-26 01:53:24
o7obu6,"I agree there’s nothing we can do with natural selection but there is SO much we can do to eliminate the waste, pollution, poaching, etc. 
Everyone needs to come to realize the fact that we as a human race are killing the sea and all the incredible creatures and it’s inhabitants. I encourage for everyone to inform themselves and understand the brutality we have done to our oceans and ways we can help revive what we’ve done. And I’m sorry this is definitely not directed directly at you, but everyone. …and I will be getting off my pedestal now, just the ocean is so special to me (and obviously others) and when I get a chance, I like to spread a little bit of knowledge and awareness.

s6fvqj,"In some deep [/r/conspiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy) rabbitholes the line of thinking is that visitors disable nukes because those are the only things we possess capable of posing a threat to their craft.

I'd say the rather more common groupthink one comes across on that subreddit is that they do it so we don't destroy the planet with nuclear war, have averted nuclear war by doing that before, and world governments have been given ultimatums as far as disclosure, most of which people think are overdue or due Soon™. Most people seem to agree that by and large the visitors adhere to a prime-directive like doctrine of general non-interference.

10zw29z,"Nurses are incredible people. I watched them keep my mom alive while she was waiting for a heart transplant, as the doctors (who were also amazing, but it’s a very different job) would come around twice a day during their rounds.

Same as you, we had our first child who was 22 months when my second was born. I had a high risk pregnancy for #2 and he was scheduled as a C section, but I went into labor the night prior. My son was born with a heart defect and had some issues at birth… the grace, love and care the nurses showed me and my son at this little small town community hospital… man, it makes me tear up even thinking about it. I had trouble nursing both boys, and these young women would come in and were so gentle and kind to help me, it made me feel so much better.

I remember my mom had incredible nurses at this huge hospital in a major city, a couple of them were combat medics. Truly humbling to see these people who work in a CVICU (cardiovascular ICU) to just be SO CALM and chill and collected and relatable day in and day out for her three month stay. The cheers she got when her new heart came in… gah, tears.

I’m rambling.

I’m sorry. I guess I just want to say that I agree with you. Nurses are amazing people and this video touched me. ❤️",2023-02-12 03:00:29

I remember forgetting my purse on the train years and years ago after a night out. I got home in a panic, about 17, wondering how I'm gonna sort out replacing everything etc. And then my mam showed me my purse, saying a man knocked our door to drop it off. That's always amazed me to this day years later... He actually went out of his way to drop it off himself. I couldn't believe it.

He didn't leave his name or anything, and I always wondered how far out of his way he travelled and can only hope he was local and didn't travel too far. It was so, so kind. I wish I knew his name so I could've thanked him in some way... But maybe sometimes you've got to just accept the kind act, and pay it forward whenever you can ✨",2021-03-27 15:39:06

f1d45o,"My little brother once saved a baby iguaca parrot after it got slingshot and landed on rocky ground. My brother was playing outside when he found it and brought it to the house. He told my mom, a nurse, and asked her to teach him how to get the bird better. We nursed it back to health and brought it to a veterinarian to check on it. Once the parrot was healthy my brother released it. Well, that parrot came in to our yard literally every other week for years. It even brought a family. The parrot died last year almost 20 years after we found it. Sometimes it would bring us jewelry or trinkets it found. It was very affectionate. And it used to do this little dance and little song for my brother every time it would land on him. It was like it would greet him “my main man!”  It was loving and friendly to everyone in the house but it really loved my brother, his getting the most of the bird’s quirks, attention and funny songs. We named him Salami. Man we loved that animal. It was beautiful and so good for my brother, as it helped him cope with his autism and shyness. Because of that parrot my brother met his wife. The parrot landed on my brother at the beach then flew to the future wife and tried to befriend her. She was freaked out at first and the bird panicked then shit on her. Then the bird started bringing trinkets to her place since my brother would stay there. Eventually it became a goof for them that the bird would find them no matter where they’d be in the area. My brother had him at the wedding. Salami was literally the best wing man there was. We tried keeping him in the house but he was so much happier being out. At first we thought it was a weird thing that the parrot came back every few days but whenever my brother would get near it we noticed it would do the weird dance and song. We realized the parrot was trying to make kinship after the vet explained that to us and we just helped it by leaving feeders for it, taking it to the vet every few months for check ups and letting it do what it wanted. We registered it at a local preservation for the creatures since we eventually found their population was shrinking. He helped make some 30 more little parrots! In general, Salami just wanted to cuddle to my brother’s head or play with him or bring us stuff. As it got old it became homebound by choice. When he died it was like losing a sibling as he was likely only a 5 years younger than us. So do I believe animals or a certain few of them can remember us. I think they can. Not all, but still.

*I just realized part of your username is “Salami”. That’s hilarious and a bit of a deja vu moment. 😂",2020-02-10 02:55:28

Parents leave the playground when my boys arrive.  It’s frustrating, tiring, and honestly I need a break now and then. Every morning, when I get home from work, and before bed I hug them (regardless on how pissed I am 😡) and tell them how much I love them.

uyf52d,"Yeah but the minerals would have be to mined out of the earth by underpaid workers, and the money would be put into hands of a company that would continue to do evil around the world. And the tire could be destroyed, creating non-biodegradable waste.

So he should have walked.

Except his shoes were made by slave laborers overseas or in South America, and he'd be supporting evil in that way as well. And the shoes might get holes in them, and he'd have to replace them, feeding more money into the hands of the rich.

So he really should just stop existing altogether. 🙄 .. because there's always a downside to one's preferred form of transportation.",2022-05-27 10:03:20

cdlohu,A couple years ago I was driving on the highway and saw a kitten in the middle of the road.  Traffic was way to heavy and moving entirely too fast for me to do anything.  It also took me a second to process what I had just saw and by then it was too late.  Broke my heart and I still wonder what happened to that little kitty. 😢 Since that day I’ve seen a few instances of kittens in the middle of the highway and it boggles my mind how they get there.,2019-07-16 03:07:44

r424sa,"> So go get a rabies shot?

🤣🤣🤣

> Treatment after exposure can prevent the disease if given within 10 days. The rabies vaccine is 100% effective if given early, and still has a chance of success if delivery is delayed.[26][28][73] Every year, more than 15 million people get vaccinated after potential exposure. While this works well, the cost is significant.[74] In the US it is recommended people receive one dose of human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) and four doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period.[75] HRIG is expensive and makes up most of the cost of post-exposure treatment, ranging as high as several thousand dollars.[76] In the UK, one dose of HRIG costs the National Health Service £1000,[77] although this is not flagged as a ""high-cost medication"".[78] A full course of vaccine costs £120–180.[79] As much as possible of HRIG should be injected around the bites, with the remainder being given by deep intramuscular injection at a site distant from the vaccination site.[28]

It’s expensive af, painful and if you wait too long there’s no reversing the effects, including death.

Your ignorance on the subject is impressive in it’s scope and scale.  You should become a Trump supporter; you’re certainly stupid enough.",2021-11-28 14:36:03

Sidewalk chatter is part of the culture and there’s a huge sense of community in most neighborhoods. And, again, contrary to popular belief, kids are very nice and super friendly because they’re often safer (especially in the NE) with so many adults around, even strangers, who can intervene if things get weird, so their interactions with random adults are generally more positive and t, obviously, they have more of these interactions than kids elsewhere would (because rolling up on kids in the suburbs radiates an entirely different, creepy energy…)

WTF?!? LOL. Uh, that's better than doing nothing I guess and probably about as good as you can do with a pet on a boat in the ocean short of a tracker. But how about leaving him home or with a sitter in the future. You know... on LAND?

I'm not trying to suggest the owner is necessarily a negligent POS and needs to be cancelled, harrassed, swatted, or whatever. People do legal dumb crap with their pets all the time. Doesn't always make it right but to each their own. But...

>“I was crying, I was sobbing,” said Zuko’s owner. “I’m so grateful for them because they saved me such a huge heartbreak.”

What? So your response to almost losing a beloved family member and suffering said heartbreak is to give him a life jacket and be like, ""That oughta do it!""

For those that don't know, the intended purpose of a life jacket is to aid in saving the wearers life if there is an emergency situation in the water and the wearers life is at risk. 👀

Question: Had this been a child, elderly or disabled person (ie a human loved one), would we be spewing ""Sweet story!"" and ""What a brave little guy!""?

10ggr6t,"Yeah, I introduced my dog to water via the beach and my parents’ pool and she very much is not a fan. I would NEVER stress her out like that unless it was a necessary mode of transportation or I had no one to watch her for whatever reason (I can’t think of one!) 

Even then, I thought about buying her a life jacket the next time we even go to the beach but she doesn’t even want to get her toes wet, so i may be overreacting 😂 

I know some dogs love water but the responsibility falls on the human to make sure it’s done safely.

10ggr6t,"I didn’t say no one interpreted that way. So, I’m not sure what your point is. 

Went off on them? 😂 Exaggerate much? I didn’t go off on them at all. If you say something and half the people think you meant one thing, and the other half think you meant another thing, you didn’t articulate yourself well. If you don’t agree, good for you. 

I don’t measure what I said based on whether one person or two people, or five people, on Reddit agree with me. That might be how you measure what you say, but it’s not how I measure what I say. I think for myself. If people agree, they agree, if they don’t, they don’t.

But if half of the people reading what I wrote understand what I meant, and the other half think I meant the opposite of what I actually meant, that’s my fault, not theirs. As far as I’m concerned that common sense.",2023-01-22 00:42:51

pdwzep,"There are so many examples of why humans are bad. There are so many examples of why humans are good.

Numbers don't matter as much here imo. The weight of good actions is much heavier than the weight of bad actions. It's harder to be a good person than a""bad"" or even neutral one. 

When someone makes a choice to go out of their way to be a good human, it means a lot more to me than someone allowing themselves to slip into evil actions. Of course for some, it truly is easy to do good things.

There will always be bad shit going on, but focusing on and contributing to the good makes a literal world of difference. Even the little things. A smile for a stranger. Holding the door for someone behind you. Those are great ways to start.

Don't be depressed my friend. There has always been terrible people in the world but there are plenty of good ones fighting back. Be one of them. And be well! 💜",2021-08-29 18:30:26

6sqrvq,"So a couple things--

1) buy used! It's the only way we managed to do astrophotography. 

2) You can get a really good scope that's still small in size. This is important because the bigger the scope, the bigger your mount will need to be to counter the payload. Which means the more money your mount will cost. It also means it'll be a bigger pain in the ass to set up shop (the head of my husband's first mount alone was 50 lbs without the tripod on it!).

I know it's an expensive hobby and I obviously don't know your financial situation, but if it's something you are really, really into, be aggressively pursuing the buy/sell groups. Yes there are set ups going for 100k, but there are a lot that are more reasonable, especially at the low end (as people upgrade etc). The astronomy community is full of wonderful people who could help you out too. If you look in your area you may be able to find star parties to join and talk to people about it, view some scopes etc. 😊",2017-08-10 12:38:44

We had to lie to our family and call my moms wife a “roommate” we have religious family that shunned us. This, this is the most beautiful thing and my heart can barely take it.

Slavery, treating women as inferior beings, condemning homosexuality (which is not a choice and is determined before birth), opposing birth control, being against a mother having the right to choose if she wants to abort her baby, against pre-marital sex, and brainwashing children with falsehoods which make them believe they’re born into sin are all great things...

On top of christianity (and all religions, especially all organised messianic monotheistic ones) being a man-made lie and incompatible with scientific fact and reason, I wonder why christianity is dying 🤔

edit: okay, I get it. special needs girl was wearing white. not all weddings have to follow the traditional script. from reading more about the bride, it's unlikely the twin will ever get married (not saying it's impossible, just very unlikely). the sisters are obviously very close.

and this wasn't something the special needs girl threw a tantrum over. it was important to the bride for her twin to be included. settle down y'all and consider enjoying a wholesome moment 🙂",2021-10-05 20:58:26

Grows some weed, but it’s legal here and I can handle that. To end all that, former neighbor came back one day and in broad daylight took a crowbar and hammer to the super box to get at the mail. I happened to be across the street, and got almost all of it on video. What an idiot. The cops were called, and I even got to go pick him out of a photo lineup(never done anything like that before, it was kind of cool!) 

We had another guy around the corner who called the city/cops/hydro on us as well, and a few others in the neighborhood, he was just a dick with nothing better to do. His landlord didn’t care as much about getting him out, he was more “well I get my rent money every month, so…”

zswqaw,"Yeah the major problem is phosphates need to be given intravenously. Phosphate is needed for cell membrane transport and loads of other things and once you eat after a long time of starvation your electrolytes which have been carefully balanced by the body despite starvation go out of whack insulin is created etc and the body goes into a kind of shock. 
Just by administering phosphate the chance of death by refeeding goes from around 100% to about 20%
It’s incredible what the body can survive ❤️",2022-12-23 03:58:12

Sometimes I have to regroup and reorient myself when something like this rubs me the wrong way and remind myself that people who aren’t in it every day don’t usually mean harm with comments that come across as flippant or judgy, they’re just making passing comments about something they don’t have a ton of info on and it isn’t coming from a place of malice.

178gaw3,"This is SO BEAUTIFUL that it’s really REALLY hard to watch… and then look up to see the SHIT going on in the news. WE should ALL take a moment to reflect on what is truly important in life, regardless where we live or who we pray to (or do not pray to). Making someone ELSE feel happy, fed, loved, safe and just generally taken care of is our true purpose in life. I feel we often lose track of that. We can’t take ANYTHING with us and the dirt we stand on belongs to NO ONE. We are all here renting. Be kind. This clip was/is fantastic. Well done Sir. Well done. 🥰🔥",2023-10-15 17:08:05

d79wu9,"You got downvoted but it’s kinda true. The kitten we got was supposed to be my husbands cat, as his other cat sadly passed away in feb. (I have a cat that loves me to death) 

Well I’m the mom, so this kitten has been fed by me, I change his litter, I stayed up with him when he had severe diarrhea, so guess who he likes. Lol. My husband is jealous but he didn’t put in the work soooo.

Long story short I have 2 cats now. 🙄",2019-09-21 22:18:24
d79wu9,Aw thanks! No need. The cat is like gold all by herself. She adds positivity and substance to my life ❤️,2019-09-21 23:25:32
d79wu9,"I think it’s the same with purring right? Cats don’t normally purr unless they’re with humans or something? I have two cats that were both rescued very young, maybe 6 weeks old. My older cat who’s 9 didn’t start fully meowing until about 5 years ago. She would make what I like to call pigeon noises occasionally and didn’t purr very much. Now she’s very vocal! My little guy is 2 and makes the pigeon noises sometimes, if he’s jumping up or down from a height. He purrs a lot and always has. He’ll also mimic my older girl when she’s meowing for food so he can make sure he gets some too 😂",2019-09-22 01:58:06

8bvmcf,"This is what all garbage man should strive for! Just teasing. But, That’s so courteous of him to help you out like that. I know it sucks forgetting to put out the trash. It also sucks when your trash doesn’t get taken. I had bought a 75” tv and the box for it was gigantic!! I cut up the box about half way and then stuffed the rest into the trash can. When I came home from work the box was in the middle of the road. My neighbor told me that they seen the garbage man get out of the truck, pull my tv box out of the trash can and rather than setting on the side of the trash cans he threw it into the middle of the road.  I guess he really didn’t like my box lol.  I was surprised by my garbage man’s actions this day as well. 😆",2018-04-13 09:30:48

8bvmcf,"My question to you is have you ever thought about leaving something else out? Like, maybe snacks, Gatorade, (other sports drink), maybe an energy drink or water?

Reason being beer is just not a good idea to leave out, idk the laws where you are, but in US, it’s illegal to keep alcohol inside a commercial vehicle unless it’s intended to have it. (Delivery trucks for example)

Also, what if he drinks it at work? Now you have someone intoxicated behind the wheel of a very large very heavy truck.

And third, what if they are in recovery from alcohol.

Just my view on the matter.

-Can they pay for what they ordered? (I’ve had people order, gave the benefit of doubt, already assuming no tip -fine, you’re already in a crappy position. By all means, please just eat!- but then can’t pay for what they ordered & bosses yell at me to pay for it. 😕 This guy has purchased food already!)

-Is there a smell that’s affecting everyone else? (This guy is OUTSIDE! Already doing what he can & remaining considerate!! Old job had a guy trying to come in…when I say he cleared the restaurant, I mean as if someone yelled “fire!”. Then it’s a matter of pleasing the masses. 😔 We sat him on the patio)

-Are they bothering other customers? (Clearly this guy is just keeping to himself! We have a homeless regular that sneaks in & will start talking to tables like she works there. Except then asking to try their food & reaching for it. She then flashed a guy while attempting to grope another man- I’m sorry but that’s when you gotta go.

One female wolf spider can decimate an entire fire ant colony, a roach colony, hone in on black widows and brown recluses and eat them and their eggs for dinner.

“The spider has a name? Well, it’s missing a leg.”            
“Well, he’s a tough guy.”      

I then explained to her that he probably came inside because it’s raining or he followed some cockroaches in (we are in Hawaii & cockroaches are everywhere).  She seemed satisfied that it was going to eat those fuckers and let Kawika be.     

Spiders are good as long as they are not aggressive or harmful to us. I will kill a spider if it gets too near my dog though, sorry spiders 🕷",2021-04-20 01:10:36

x52jns,"When my wife was a flight attendant she once saw a mother alone with 3 kids one of them a baby or young toddler that was really fussy.

 It was a night flight and the mother was exhausted so my wife took the baby to the back, layed a cover on the ground and gave the baby some pencils and paper and some toys. 

The mother ended up being able to get some sleep and was so grateful she gave my wife a card with her contacts and told her something like ""we're really rich and have a mansion you're welcome there anytime"" 😂

Bottom line is sometimes all fussy babies need is to see something or someone different to calm down.",2022-09-03 20:02:06
x52jns,"Was on a flight on Wednesday and a very upset baby forgot themselves when the flight attendant stopped and stood talking to the baby for a good 5 minutes.

I will literally choose inconvenient flight times and layovers as long as I’m flying SW bc I know that through the nightmare that is air travel, I can bet money on the fact that my crew will be kind, helpful, accommodating, even sometimes silly ❤️ recently flying east coast to west coast and had my flight canceled last min (v unusual), and not only did they immediately rebook me but they gave me a $100 voucher just… because? I literally didn’t even speak to an agent or anything. Love them!!!

x52jns,"The difference is we WANTED to be around the concert or auto race and paid for the privilege. A lot of us would pay more to not be on flights with children. I've flown a lot, but my parents left me with relatives when I was a baby and they traveled. They didn't take me on long haul flights as an infant because it would have been stressful to me, I wouldn't remember it anyway, and it would inconvenience everyone else. 

I was once on a flight from Dubai to New York and a toddler cried the entire time. That's literally over 6 hours. I don't blame the kid, I blame the parents for putting them in the situation they and passengers can't leave. I genuinely wish parents would stop 1. Believing everyone loves their kids and wants them around as much as they do, and 2. That if their babies/kids cry and act up, they shouldn't have to try very hard to soothe them because ""It takes a village"". 🙄

Unless they're traveling to move or for medical treatment, what concrete reason do parents have for dragging a baby onto a flight? Babysitters exist for a reason.",2022-09-04 04:21:01

awji1r,"Y’all Milwaukee gets a bad rep sometimes but I always see Milwaukee county public transit workers, in the news, as heroes. The bus drivers are truly amazing people. 

As a college student in Milwaukee, there were many times the bus driver would let me on the bus if I forgot my Id. And I rode the bus so much to my volunteer spot that this one bus driver and I got to know each other, I would get off one bus and transfer to hers since my volunteer spot was quite far. 

So one day I explained to her that I took the bus to go volunteer and work with homeless youth. After I told her that, she’d always cheer me on and thank me for my work (even though it felt like I didn’t do anything special). Well one day, it was snowing and the bus I rode before was running late so I was so nervous that I wouldn’t catch her bus which not only would I have to wait for another bus in the snow, I would also be late for my volunteer place. So there I am hoping I see her bus and as we approach my spot, I see her bus and I was soooo relieved. So I’m basically flagging her down to wait and I get on and I thank her for waiting, telling her she didn’t know how much it meant and she simply responds with “don’t worry baby, I knew your bus was coming, I was taking my sweet time to buy your bus time. No one even noticed.” ... Y’all, i seriously got so teary eyed bc I was so stressed that day and her simple gesture had given me so much worth and peace. That amidst of feeling alone and stressed about life and time, someone, a simple stranger, was looking out for me. - I ended up asking what her favorite snack and drink was so I could get it for her next time, and though she refused anything, I told her I wanted to show my appreciation. 

I stopped seeing her after that semester ended  but, Rhonda from the Purple line, you’re an amazing person and I still think about your kindness, 4 years later. Representing Milwaukee well 💕",2019-03-02 21:06:22

So it is a tough one because on the one hand you are totally right. I got a lot better once I had a person who was there for me. On the other hand I couldn't count on anyone to be there for me and I needed to fix it on my own. It's really tough out there and not a position I envy being in.

zfzs2e,"When I was a child, we had a Shih-Tzu. Famously require a lot of care to keep their coats healthy. My mom after a while couldn't afford to take him to the groomer as often, so she started cutting his fur and having me shampoo him instead of a groomer. One day when I was lathering him up I saw that he had a mat. Just one. Right behind one of his legs. When I touched it he got defensive... And he was the sweetest dog ever, so that was startling. I immediately told my mom, and she said simply ""so cut it, then."" I immediately got set to work. Locked me and Elvis in the bathroom together and gently convinced him to lay on his side, him being his usual darling self. Stretched out the leg and he tried to nip me, pulling his leg back. I tried again with a shorter stretch and he let me do that one. I moved all the fur out of the way with puppy clips to get a better look... It was awful. The mat was a thin band cutting in to his flesh. A bit of fur on either side had gotten tangled together and pulled tight every time he walked. There was blood in the fur. First I took the trimming scissors and tried to cut right at the root of the hairs on one side, and he whined. I got a little bit disconnected right on top of the root of the mat. When I tried again he actually pulled away and cried. I told my mom I thought he needed a professional vet/groomer to remove the mat because it was hurting him. She gifted him to a new owner who could afford that. I was so heartbroken. My amazing little friend had to go away to live with someone else because we couldn't afford his basic care. I was 8-9. 😭",2022-12-08 16:53:17

zfzs2e,Fr 💀,2022-12-08 16:26:39
zfzs2e,"Unfortunately it’s not true at all 🥲 A dog with a type of coat that grows continuously (like shih tzus) will not be able to survive outdoors on its own for long. 

The undercoat will fail to shed properly as the coat gets longer and longer, therefore getting impacted to the skin. Friction from running/moving around will make it worse. Getting wet in puddles or the rain will make it worse. A sedentary indoor dog that has good personal grooming will still mat, but not as quickly.

Once the mats get too tight, it could easily immobilise joints or even amputate them. They can also block the penis/vulva and anus.

(I’m a groomer in case that wasn’t obvious 😅)",2022-12-09 07:11:31

Tamberi had been one of the favourites for the 2016 Olympics only to rupture the ligaments of his left ankle 20 days before Rio. Many times he feared he would never be as good again.

fiz3zs,"I‘m from Germany, underwent chemo and radiation therapy a few years ago. 

Transportation is covered by health insurance - though I had heard that only a taxi back from chemo treatment would be paid by some insurance companies and you were supposed to use public transportation to get there, since you were supposed to be fit on your way there. I called my insurance about this and they just said „if your doctor says you need a taxi, then you need a taxi and it will be covered“. Taxi company charged the insurance directly, it‘s like a prescription for medicine. I didn‘t have to bother at all. 

Later for radiation therapy I had to be there daily for 35 days (clinic is 40km one way). Since that didn‘t affect me that much in terms of general well-being, I could drive there myself. Insurance covered 0,30 Euros per kilometer. I should add that I love driving, it was summer and I had a cabrio. Happiness makes healthy! 😃",2020-03-15 14:26:58

When my brother was a kid he legit thought they could read minds. We were getting out of my parents car and one of the turkeys randomly tried to attack my brother.

f3anrj,"Oh good, I was worried I worded things in a way to deeply offend! I agree that people shouldn't automatically call out abuse either. Really people over the internet have no way of knowing. I know a few people as well that have tried their best to give their kids every chance they can, and the kid just continue to be horrible to them even into adulthood. Its really hard seeing that side too. They get taken advantage of and abused by their own kids.

Thank you for the kind words and well wishes! I wish for you, and the parents you see struggling the same! 💕 Happy Valentine's day!",2020-02-15 04:25:46

ppcfpw,"I drive semis and I almost hit a turtle by accident. It was so tiny I didn’t even realize what it was until it was too late to stop. The road was full of bends and only 2 lanes traffic coming both directions. I, luckily, was able to position my truck directly over the turtle and run over top it with a 53’ trailer. I was so scared i had still hit it but when I came back there was no evidence of road kill.

I luckily have not hit any animals knock on wood. The thing with big trucks is you cant really stop for things that fast you only can try to dodge it. I will literally be devastated if i ever hit an animal, I *just* saw a TINY baby fawn in the road today and I was so upset I wanted his mom to come get him out of the road. I hope he was reunited I didn’t see her when I passed him but 15 minutes later he was gone back in the woods hopefully 🙏",2021-09-16 22:20:56

She was just 14 years old and had been fighting Neuroblastoma for nearly 10 years without remission. Her name is Cambri, and I went to school with her. We live in a very small town. Seeing all those bikers come together, some from several towns over, all just for her was incredibly emotional. The majority of the residents here also held signs welcoming her home and lined the streets for miles. Rest in paradise, Cambri and FUCK CANCER💛💜",2023-03-22 01:28:54

I went to Ipswich to visit friends, and we were out walking one night, and I noticed a cctv camera on a pole seemed to be following our movements. Being a hardheaded american (2009) I couldn't believe there were eyes & hands behind a city surveillance camera. It was too dystopian future scifi to be true.
So I broke off from the group to experiment, being a jerk and making the camera follow me to & around its base. Laughing like an idiot and being kind of freaked out in my head that it was happening at all, & that my friends were like, yeah...they watch, they'll even call cops to the area if they see trouble, it's normal.

yod266,"This never occurred to me. 🥺 I have a golden that I’m training in as many situations as I can. Loud ones especially so he is never reactive. He’s now amazing even right next to an emergency vehicle or ducks/squirrels. He hates tall men though. 🫤 Our kiddo has epilepsy and emergency vehicles are an increasingly rare part of our lives. NOW, I will be more thoughtful towards my golden bc he’s such a good boy! Smh - I learn to be more thoughtful when I see others being thoughtful. I’m not sure if that is the usual way people learn, if people are just born kinder or if I was just so anxious I didn’t have capacity to think of others. You don’t know what you don’t know.

yod266,"Yea my dog smiles, it's not a human smile of course. But you can tell by her face she's happy. Although Labradors are quite expressive. She doesn't bear her teeth but rather she pulls her jowls back slightly, she slightly squints her eyes and her ears perk up towards you. With mad helicopter tail wags, it's not even a wag, it's a very circular motion 🤣",2022-11-07 17:34:11

Although it seems fair, leaves a much colder feeling than when everyone is fighting for the bill. 

I went to international school, so we had kids from East Asia, S.E. Asia, South Asia, Latin America, Africa, North America and Europeans, and we ethnic kids would always fight for the bill while the ""white"" kids just stand by and watch 😂 like not that they wouldn't offer but them fighting for the bill is a really sad ""oh let me take care of it"" but if you say ""no it's fine"" they just accept it, whereas your ethnic friends will threaten to stop being your friend.",2021-12-29 10:07:56

9gqlxh,"For-profit insurance has to be one of the scummiest industries of the modern day. The concept of insurance makes sense. Everyone pools some of their money together so if some misfortune occurs to any one of them, they afford to deal with it without financial ruin.

Then some assholes come along and decide that they deserve a bigass chunk of that money pool just because they hired some middle class workers to do the paperwork. And they'll find any reason to screw you over if it saves them a buck.

Insurance seems like exactly the kind of thing that governments and nonprofits were made for, and yet we're sitting here praying that we don't lose our life savings from firefighters putting out a fire. Or worse, going into financial ruin from unforseen health issues 🇺🇸. I can't believe we still put up with this shit.",2018-09-18 07:09:44

lycdy8,"Yeah as long as we will use the kitty wand, he will stay out to play, but no touching is allowed. He is finally letting us reach out a hand without running and hiding, but still no touching. My kids are probably the most frustrated but my husband and I just keep reinforcing that we have to go slow to get him to trust us. Also, it's hard to name a cat you don't see 🤣

I actually just rescheduled his first vet appt because I worried it would be too traumatic. 

Glad to hear you had luck and it gives us hope!",2021-03-05 20:16:21

Sure the way they’re saying it is debatably correct, but it’s incorrect for them to say the other correct way is wrong.

As we were exiting the park, a worker asked us how our trip was and my 9 year old brother was like “Awful cuz I couldn’t ride the hulk coaster!” The worker responded “well let me see what I can do for you!” The worker spoke into their walkie talkie for a moment, then brought us to one of the gift shops as you leave the park and said we could have whatever we wanted from the store, no charge. Being a layaway kid, this was a dream. We both ended up getting these $50 toy swords that we used to bonk each other the whole drive back and forgot about anything else. Will never forget that; totally an awesome moment of kindness, especially considering this was also the time our mom abandoned us at the park for 4 hours 😂",2023-02-02 22:00:13

9nk5hi,"Super fun story time! So something similar happened in my parents property that was up for sale (no one lived there), but no one called to tell me as I was kind of the grounds keeper. I turn up to mow and there's bones and bit all over the place from coyotes. I find the biggest part of it and decide to bury it in the woods on the back half of the lot. It looks like jerky at this point. It's been at least a solid week of sunshine and 90°F days so I think it's probably dried out. 



I set a garbage bag out next to it and get my shovel under it to flip it into the bag.



It. Fucking. Explodes. It is raining gore and maggots. It's in my mouth. It's on me. The neighbors almost called emergency services because they thought something had happened to me. I was screaming and crying and running around with maggots falling off me. My dad still has the voicemail of me sobbing unintelligibly about it being in my hair.


That's why you shouldn't bury stuff. ♥",2018-10-12 18:37:18

If it’s the kind that can’t bring it’s neck back into its shell, you can’t grab it on the side like this because it’s neck can reach around the sides. If you encounter a snapping turtle with that kind of neck (they don’t/can’t pull it back into their shell), grab the shell right behind its head, and the shell above it’s tail. He can’t reach up to grab your fingers but he can reach around. 
Grabbing the tails can also really hurt them. This guy did great 👍

Turtles have something called a swim bladder that fills with air to allow flotation.  When tuned upside down, the valve on this bladder jams shut, trapping the air inside.  This turtle will never get far under water, and if it tries the bladder will rupture due to the pressure.  A rupture related death is probably better than the alternative... baking in the sun and starving to death.  ☹️",2018-09-08 06:41:53

At the time I did not understand the pain they both went through, both emotional and physical. But today I do and my heart hurts for them and their family.

e5ljoc,"There are two ways to donate. The most used procedure (about 80% of the time) is called Peripheral Blood Stem Cell donation and OP described it perfectly in a comment above. Basically you register, the registry contacts you because you might be a match, bunch of blood draws. If you're still the best match for the patient they do a health check in a hospital and soon after you donate. You get a growth factor administered for 5 days so you produce more stem cells and at day 5 you donate via blood (looks like a blood plasma donation). Most registries around the world have a lot of info on their respective websites or even videos. Check it out! ☺",2019-12-03 21:49:34
e5ljoc,"There are two types to donate stem cells. Can only say what's true for my country but for example with a herniated disc the risk for a potential decline of your health would be too high so you would only be eligible for a Blood Stem Cell Donation. For many autoimmune diseases it's the other way around, like with a stronger form of psoriasis you would only be eligible for donating via bone marrow. You can call or email most registries if you have a certain health condition and ask them if you could be a donor. They will help you out! ☺",2019-12-03 21:59:16

You have flu like symptoms for a few days but after the donation you are fine. A Bone Marrow donation is slightly more invasive but not as awful aa some horror stories tell you on the internet. Basically they give you anesthesia and inject a needle in your hip bone. No potential nerve damage or else and afterwards you have a small bruise on your back. Whole procedure is only around an hour.

And the pain from the blows isn't even really felt bc of the panic of oxygen deprivation, if that makes it any less (more?) scary lol I would have jackhammered my ribs in that moment, I ran full tilt into that table corner over and over and the adrenaline kept me going ig. I didn't feel any of it, just the overwhelming relief when it popped free. 

I also worked at a daycare, we had a baby choke on a (cut up) grape- it takes smth the size big enough to cover a straw hole to obstruct an infants windpipe. A STRAW HOLE. my aunt owned the daycare, my mom and great aunt and I were also teachers. I knew they all thought the best way to dislodge a choking hazard was either 1. Stick fingers in throat to sweep it out (no, do a quick and gentle finger sweep, don't feel shit then DO NOT shove fingers deeper!!) Or 2. Bang kid on back hard as shit or 3.) Hold upside down and bang kid or 4.) All the above. They all 4 tried these things over and over, panicking as baby got limper, I tore out of my class and had to wrestle it away from my panicked mom, did baby heimlich, got him breathing. I was 15. I don't say my age to brag lol more to say growing up with old school southern hard headed people you had to learn some damn survival skills 😂

pyhln3,"I actually knew a girl in high school who had this and everyone told her “it was just stress or nerves”  she would go to the nurse everyday and teachers would roll their eyes and say she didn’t want to do work. People even said she was doing it for the attention and not eating for the attention. Or because she wanted to be “skinny” 

Even her fucking doctor wrote her off and said her crying was “a sign she was lying” 

It took a nurse who watched her walk of the doctors office to tell her her problem was with her appendix and it was literally about to burst. She had to do an emergency surgery and everything.

She literally almost died because teachers and nurses are assholes and she literally was just not listened to this much. 

So sad.

Her stomach and everything was so swollen she said she didn’t realize and just thought she was gaining weight. 😢

the lockdowns screwed me so bad. i had to look for alternate ways to make some profits. i started investing and managed to get a passive income.

but its got to a point where all i had was into investments (i didnt have MUCH to begin with tho).

so once i got the money i had saved working, i thought i needed a more steady income, decided to look for a job and thats what i did.

once there i just proved i was there to do MY JOB. they took me serious and they know im not gonna let BS fuck me up. so thats what i do. i work hard, and i like to think i work also smart, and they started to value me on the company.

its the same method i used on my previous job pre-covid, and it also worked.

stand up for yourself, learn to respond with ‘No’ (always being respectful and fair) and they will see how to treat you right.

i wish you the best! and keep grinding 💪🏼 im sure you got this.",2021-09-30 15:40:01

tx251y,"There was a homeless man I interacted with back in college who taught me how to eat Chipotle properly. He was outside begging for food on a pretty cold day in the fall. I happened to be getting food at the chipotle nearby and just got my paycheck so figured I’d have a few extra dollars to spare. So I invite him to get some chipotle and he doesn’t hesitate to pick up his things and follow. Went to the line and he asks me if he can get two. I figured he’d eat it for dinner or something tonight so I said sure, making sure I had enough. He orders two bowls and told me how you actually get more food with two bowls and you can get a free tortilla on the side if you like it burrito style (I only ever ate it burrito style. I was a naive kid and assumed you’d get the same portions cuz it’s the same price). 

Anyway, he thanks me and goes to leave as I pay. When I went out, he was across the street giving his food to some homeless woman and child 😭. I dunno if it was his family or just another group that he knew needed it more or what the story was. I wish I had more money at that time to help him. 

But now I’m able to offer help whenever I see them. Although sometimes they buy cigarettes with the money, so I just tend to get them food now.",2022-04-05 23:39:53

gxj30h,Some people seriously just hate emojis because the younger generations really like them and can be a bit annoying about it as children tend to be when they really like things. Some people are just in on it as a joke. Some people don't really care. 🤷🏻‍♂️,2020-06-06 07:17:12

gxj30h,I was thinking high speed clothesline and then he pushed it similar to the video but his leg would be at a 90 degree angle to the bike and his calf would be against the exhaust.

pmmwpe,"1:) My reddit age is unverified. I’m sure you could generalize if you go back through my posts but. 😁

2. Not all were personal encounters. For instance when I watched 7 cops tell my friend to get inside (when he was sitting on HIS porch). They were next door for an unrelated incident. My boi said he was on his property (he did talk back but he was NOT in the wrong) and low and behold he got tazed, his ass kicked, black and bruised from head to toe. 

Or when I crashed and two cops accused me of being on drugs. That one was fun. Talked mad shit I did. 

Or when my cousin got pulled over and he had heroin on him. IN MY CAR. (Didn’t know he was an addict) It was right down the road so I drove down and was smoking a cig because I was mad and started talking to the cops to see why. They told me to put my cig out. I said no, im upset and it cost money (I WAS STRESSSSEDDD) but I will happily back up. (And did by about ten feet). They told me again and again I said we’re outside in far enough away. Next thing I know I’m in handcuffs with one cop listing off charges to charge me with. (Interfering with an investigation bla bla bla) Another agreeing. A third asked for my license which was in my truck. Boi he was surprised when I rambled off my License Number. 😂😂

Point is, none of those circumstances warranted the actions of those in charge.",2021-09-12 14:43:20

Despite the “guard” around the muffler, my first bike when I was a little over 4yrs old, a 1975 Kawasaki 75cc Mini-Bike, was notorious for them. ;)

1buu4p6,"India is going through it, as well. My understanding is it's a rebuke of the old caste system. (Someone will chime in to correct or corroborate.) The US had its reckoning in the 70s. Trash, litter, smog everywhere! I remember those days as a child. I'm glad we figured it out. You'd think that after the plague in the 1700s or polio in the 1900s that we would've gotten it together. Ugh. 

Better late than never, I suppose. I pray we never go backwards on this lesson and continue to improve. We've still a ways to go.

Respect your sanitation workers! I don't care if it's the garbage man, the hotel maid, the school custodian, or the office janitor. The people who keep our places clean (disposing trash, mopping floors, scrubbing toilets, sweeping steps, wiping doorknobs, washing windows) are our guardian angels in this world. They are critically important for a stable and safe community. 

And even if, by chance, you don't think you speak their language, 🖐🏼 😊 is universal. ""Ope"" is, too lol! Say hello, respect their work zone, be grateful they're there. You'll definitely notice if they aren't, that's for damn sure, so let's be more supportive of these jobs.",2024-04-03 20:08:40
1buu4p6,"Right? Had the misfortune of snaking my own toilet three months ago. First-time experience. My gods, I got mad respect for the people who do this on the regular in stranger's homes .
