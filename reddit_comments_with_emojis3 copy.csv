This seems to be very controversial on reddit. Every time i mention i like height differences, i get lots of 'eew' or 'pedo' replies and so on. 

Which is bizarre to me, lol, there are LOTS of women that are below 5'4 out there. Well, at least here in Brazil it's quite common to see 20 y.o+ women that are short, it has nothing to do with age (my brother's gf is about 35 y.o, btw). But i guess americans either don't realize that most of other countries have shorter people on average, or the fact that you people just love to throw 'pedo' accusations at every opportunity, like when a father is playing with his daughter in a park.

pll14q,"Not to be the shit parent in the room, but my daughter was a few months over two when COVID hit, and the minimal WFH I did was really tough for me. I found it impossible to focus on work with a toddler running around like a maniac.

And she's a... STRONG personality. Sometimes less is more. When I only have a few hours after work to spend with her before bedtime, I'm often more appreciative of that time and show more patience. When it's a full day, little things build up and things can get more tense by bedtime.  I love the girl, but 3 is a SLOG. 😪",2021-09-11 02:25:15

7cw2m9,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand microtransactions. The intent is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Austrian economics most of the money will go out of a typical gamer’s wallet. There’s also EA’s opportunistic scheming, which is deftly woven into its monetization- its corporate philosophy draws heavily from Hobbesian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the sense of pride and accomplishment, to realise that they’re not just looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis- they say something deep about challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and OF COURSE attainable via GAMEPLAY. As a consequence people who dislike Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 truly ARE armchair developers- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in EA’s existential catchphrase “It's In The Game,” which itself is an ironic reference to Norah McClintock’s young adult novel Truth and Lies. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated nerf herders providing candid feedback in earnest as EA’s avarice unfolds itself on their computer screens. What sheep.. how I pity them. 

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the twi'leks’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 60,000 credits of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid",2017-11-14 23:35:11

7cw2m9,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment. The unlocks are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of selecting initial values based upon data from the Open Beta, Battlefront 2 will go over a typical gamers head. There's also EA's other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch, which are deftly woven into this game development- the game's philosophy draws heavily from average per-player credit earn rates, for instance. The gamers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate that we'll be making constant adjustments, to realise that it's not just fun- they say something deep about GAMES. As a consequence people who dislike EA truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, that we ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Mat Everett's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens.

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Mass Effect tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for appreciative gamers' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

7cw2m9,"To be fair, you have to have a *very* high IQ to understand microtransactions. The intent is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Austrian economics most of the money will go out of a typical gamer’s wallet. There’s also EA’s opportunistic scheming, which is deftly woven into its monetization- its corporate philosophy draws heavily from Hobbesian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly *appreciate* the sense of pride and accomplishment, to realise that they’re not just looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis- they say something deep about challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and OF COURSE attainable via GAMEPLAY. As a consequence people who dislike Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 truly ARE armchair developers- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in EA’s existential catchphrase “It's In The Game,” which itself is an ironic reference to Norah McClintock’s young adult novel Truth and Lies. I’m smirking right now just *imagining* one of those addlepated nerf herders providing candid feedback in earnest as EA’s avarice unfolds itself on their computer screens. What sheep.. how I *pity* them. 😂

sxr3y9,"Congratulations on your twins!!! I’m glad the headphones are helping. Your comment just triggered a memory from when my son was a baby. My mother in law was visiting and my husband and I were chatting about using our noise cancelling headphones to help with stress from the crying. An important note here is that my MIL is deaf but she can hear a bit but mostly lip reads. We were eating and weren’t signing at the time. So anyway, she starts chiming in with “you don’t want to do that… when my son was a baby I could vacuum and he’d sleep through it” and “no seriously you guys that’s a bad idea.. he can’t get too used to it being quiet!! He will never sleep!!” And finally we were like… wtf are you talking about??? And we figured out she thought we meant putting the headphones on the baby! We were like… crying clearly doesn’t bother him, why would we do that?? 😂😂 at the time, I was like angry from sleep deprivation and this conversation made me so mad, against all logical sense. Luckily in retrospect it’s pretty funny but man at the time… haha!

sxr3y9,"Congratulations! Welcome to the Club. Okay jumping right in.

 If they are still newborns get anything around the house that needs to be done, done. Come crawling/walking it ... changes the game real...real fast. 
I was in the process of changing careers when we found out she was pregnant so I waited to take a web development boot camp till there were older. I ended up doing it when they were 2ish. Sucked. Do it now while they only need changes, cuddles, sleep, food. These are the easy days right now. 

I found that watching Star Trek Next Gen, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager were great baby watching shows. Older shows so the audio is much quieter. Even though there is some action each episode it is surprisingly tame. I dunno some of the episodes are really cringe but delightful nonetheless.

We had problems with one of the boys sleeping around 8-10 months. I ended up ordering a foam incline insert for him and it fixed his waking up problem instantly. 

If they're 2 Boys or 2 Girls. I recommend for the first 4 years getting the same of most things. Like similar shoes, clothes, etc. I'm not saying identical more like , .. our mantra is ""All fair and equal"". The only real disagreements that we get between them relates to one having the 'cooler' item. So if they are reasonably the same it's usually smooth sailing. Also Facebook Marketplace should be your go to for shopping. Best deals on clothes, books, toys, etc. Stuff that has barely been touched for fractions of the price. For some reason you put Baby/Kid on something and it 3x the price. I hate Facebook but suffer for the Marketplace.

A quick humble brag but also I feel was the secret to my success. My Boys just turned 4 and they are reading @ 1-2nd grade level and they are doing 1-2nd grade maths. 
The secret? I read to them all the time. When they watch TV I have the closed captioning on and volume slightly low. I have counted and involved math in everything from the start. Not like equations but conceptual stuff. Explore 1 of something. Core concepts of what a single unit is and kind of went from there. I also before I help them say, 'What do we do? We Stop, Look, and Think!"" and work the problem through as I help them . I swear it is the trick. Explore concepts from the beginning. Textures, views, sounds, tastes ..... one of their favorite games is when they were little and highchair age, I would go through our spice cabinet and let them smell the spices, taste them, talk about what type of flavor it was. They love it. Still do, but I think that really help nuture their curiosity. 


I can go on but the last bit of insight is this. 
Take care of yourself. More often than not all the concern and help goes to Mom. Which it should but it seems everyone kind overlooks Dad. Make sure to take the time you need to be in a good headspace to help her. I know the pandemic doesn't help things but take a walk or bike ride. Just drive around for awhile. Have a little activity that you like to do to regain your zen. On your shoulders you bear incredible weight. You're not going to be any good to them if your not good yourself. 


Once again congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'll ask the missus what we have still for baby items and try to send you all a care package.",2022-02-21 16:55:35
sxr3y9,"A wonderful reply, thank you. We're 7 months in (girl and boy) so we're slowly getting the hang of it, if I can call it that 😭. We're having issues sleeping still. But we ended up paying for one of those sleep class things and that helped a lot. But what's this incline thing? I thought we weren't supposed to use those things, though I may be mistaken for more younger babies?

We started reading super early since we seemed to be getting a tonne of books as gifts, although it seems right now that it's totally falling on deaf ears haha. But they do say you can never start too early.

I like the spices thing, sounds like potential for some funny/cute reaction moments lol. 

Thanks again.",2022-02-21 17:09:56

We were all high and bored so we did a few prank calls to them just breathing and hanging up. Few minutes later his brother calls my mate saying that there is something weird going on is it you you prick? He played it so deadpan it was impressive. He says no it's not me and what is going on? His brother tells him what happened and my mate goes, right I will come over and check what's up. So we get a mask and all head over to the house. We hide in the bushes and my mate goes to the door and starts talking to his brother and checking around the house. Part way through we start with the tapping on the windows and doors and my mate starts acting all freaked out by it too so now we have these 13yrold kids in a frenzy we burst into the house screaming and brandishing tools and my buddy screams and I swear I have never seen anyone look do terrified in my life they went white some fled upstairs. It was chaos. When we let them know that it was us they were pissed but you could send and feel their relief. I don't think that kid ever trusted us again. 😂 ",2018-01-16 09:51:24

uqu9g9,"Reminds me of the guy from “MacAfee” who sent me emails about my automatic renewal.  I knew it was fake, so I used a burner to call and get things “clarified.”  Gave him my canceled credit card number, and when he ran it, the bank instantly called me asking what was up. I told them it was a scammer, and they got his shit shut down.  He emailed me for weeks with the same energy as this guy.  There were a couple of “I’m going to find you!!” threats. I’m still looking over my shoulder. 😂",2022-05-16 19:34:03

wim1n1,"I think most people here can relate to feeling everything that your sister is feeling in that moment.💜 And I think even though some people are poking fun at it - absolutely most have felt the same way. 

Anyone who has felt this at an event: I’m bored. I want to go home. If I have to talk to one more person and fake smile that I’m happy to see them I might scream. Jesus fn Christ if one more person takes a picture of me🤬I could be watching Netflix/playing video games right now. And if we were at someone’s house - I’d be in the living room hanging out with their dog 🐾 or cat. Which would be infinitely better than being here. 💜

At least that’s what I’m thinking when I’m anywhere but home. I do like people - but from afar.😝

I could understand if you said that about a circus. But zoos actually take care of their wild life. Especially if the animals are in first world countries. It’s educational and it gives many people the opportunity to see these animals with out having to go all the way to Africa or other parts of the world where they originated from.

l64dnv,"Let’s not forget that if you have the wrong brand of tv, you can’t even *use* the streaming service THAT YOU PAY FOR because a competing TV brand has an exclusive deal with the steaming service. 

So then you try to use screen mirroring to broadcast it from your smartphone app to the TV, but it doesn’t work. So you update your phone and the TV firmware, but the latest firmware update has disabled it on androids because the TV manufacturer has an exclusive deal with Apple. 

So you try to sideload the app. It’s not technically illegal because you own the TV and pay for the app. But guess what? The latest firmware update that you installed also disabled sideloading, and the admin options on the TV are now gone so you have literally zero ability to control your own device. 

Pretty much your only option to watch the content on your TV that you’re paying for is to:

1. Put on your pirate hat,

2. VPN up,

3. Get the content on a PC,

4. Run an HDMI from your PC to the TV.

What will it take for companies to understand that the public didn’t choose the pirate’s life, the pirate’s life chose us.

And like whatever if your just repping your band and your a fan that's not only fine, it's cool. I kind of felt like a jerk for making fun of this dudes shirt begin with and feel like it was maybe a lesson I needed. 

For reference. He's an alright dude and it didn't effect our work relationship 👍

He thought he was home (he doesn’t have a dog) and I got out of him where he lived.  I had to walk him up the street. The whole time he was asking me if I knew “Steve” and I said no. I don’t know Steve.  He said he’s a pretty good guy. Did I know Steve was such a good guy? And I said no, I didn’t, but he sounds nice. 

Then I brought him to his door and he thanked me and hugged me. Took out his keys, let himself in. 

He never looked me in the eye after that day, though I felt like we had a special bond. 🤷‍♀️",2019-09-28 13:37:25

GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER, MAN. You can’t be wandering into other people’s home, what the hell is wrong with you?!? 
I’d have tased you and held you at gunpoint whilst waiting for the police to arrive. 
I live in New Orleans and 1 week ago was attacked, assaulted, robbed and carjacked by teenagers. The fact that you are so cavalier and fucking laughing about invading someone’s space is triggering me in a major way, FYI. 
Those kids laughed as I screamed and screamed for help and for them to stop. 
Yes I have serious PTSD, but it doesn’t mean that you’re not a fucking asshole here. 
Taking video? Really? You should have been arrested.",2019-09-28 12:33:09

We are destroying everything because of fear, you moronic sheep are so stupid that will do anything at this point. including doing this to your kids even when the CDC shows more that 70% of deaths are seniors ~with~ chronic diseases already in their system.

Its like seeing someone die in a car at 35 mph without airbags/safety system but rather focus on putting air bags in.... you just ban cars from society and walk.......

Making the kids suffer doesnt get rid of the virus nor does wearing a mask. My favorite part is people who are told to wear mask coming into a restaurant but dont have to wear it while sitting & eating...... like the virus is like ""whoa hes eating lets give em a break while they eat"" 😂😂

Viruses almost NEVER disapear, we still have Aids, HIV, Herpes, Malaria, even fucking Polio etc etc. Even with vacines the regular flu kills up to 650,000 a year.  You cant wear mask forever and you cant hide and wait for a virus to leave...

Plus if theirs a mask mandate why isnt there a glove mandate?? We are touching the same doors, elevators, credit card machines...

None of this makes sense but fear has a way of doing that when you are so afraid you cant think logically anymore....",2020-09-17 03:36:46

We have one prof who makes kids pick up their laptops and slowly spin 360 degrees so he can look and see if anyone is in the room with them helping them with their tests. Watched some kid in a study area start dancing w his laptop, I asked what the fuck he was on for 'medication', and he informed me his professor was making him prove someone wasnt there helping him cheat.

Certain hedge funds were heavily shorting GameStop (GME). In other words: betting on GameStop to fail.

r/wallstreetbets caught wind of this. We collectively decided to buy and hold as much GME as possible to squeeze the short sellers and force GME’s share price to rocket to the moon. How dare they attempt to ruin a piece of American culture.

Wall Street is fighting us with blatant market manipulation. Lawsuits and congressional actions are ensuing. 

Eventually, the short sellers will be forced out of their positions, driving up demand and rocketing GME to the moon.

mg3ieo,"I may have a solution 😊. I also gained a ton of weight, about 30 pounds. Recently though I've been on a diet which so far has been fantastic. Now I'm no doctor, and if you know better than I do then feel free to point out everything I'm doing wrong, because there might be major issues with my diet but hey. Basically, everyday I have 1 pack of frozen fruit (600g), 1 full 1.75 l jug of the ""Oasis"" brand 0 sugar added juice (orange mango carrot, yum!), and 2 scoops of whey protein (all max cookies and cream), and then blend it all. It makes 2 full blenders full (so I measure everything out half and half) which fits into 4 shaker cups. All in all its about 1100 calories every day, and while the first week was tough, and had me having a few meals with carbs, the last week has been fantastic. No hunger or noticeable side effects other than weight loss that I've noticed.

Edit-so to add, if I'm ever hungry I just drink some of the smoothie and that's it. Last night I actually dumped half of my last bottle as I didn't need it.. So far I'm down 9 pounds in 2 weeks, which is a lot and mostly water, but at about 1500 calories less than what I ""should"" be having every day, I should be loosing 3 pounds a week.

vdnocs,"I swear to god. One time I walked in on a whim to this empty spot at the end of the mall in VA beach.

Dude was just sitting in the chair, no one else was there. 

It was way too big to be a barber shop, like it must have been an old phone store, and they just threw down the chairs and put mirrors way the fuck on the wall 20ft from you.

I was starting a new job the next day and didn’t have time to go looking for a decent barber, I figured I was just gonna get a trim and lose some of the grunge. 

My hair was pretty long and straight down to my chin almost while I also had a 6 month beard going. 

I was polite and friendly like hey dude, would you like to cut my hair, please? 

Sure no problem.

I sit down and we’re talking bout starting the new job and he starts talking about himself and begins spraying my hair down.. so I’m like, alright, he’s just getting me ready for when I say what I want… 

Then he pulls out the clippers and starts cutting.

First it’s only a little bit from the back and sides, and then he pulls out the buzzer and starts to go in near my beard, I’m like DUDE - What are you doing????

He’s like - “the pompadour?

…Didn’t you say that?”

I was ready to cry how fucking dumb I looked starting that new job with the haircut like I just popped out of the 50s. 

It was the worst, and it still makes me cringe when I look at the pictures to this day. 🤦‍♂️😭🤷‍♂️",2022-06-16 17:36:10

m8kft5,"Only time I ever got kicked out of a bar was when my friend punched a dude and then the bartender pointed in our direction. I was seeing if the guy was ok and then a big ass bouncer bear hugged me. My friend immediately started beating the shit out of the first guy lol. 

The bouncer was pretty chill about it but just told me to go home since they were calling police. 🤷‍♂️",2021-03-19 21:34:29

m8kft5,"A bar I was at in Reno would just let the drunks sleep it off at the table and then sell them more bloody marys/breakfast when they woke up in the morning. 

That's when I realized the 2am cut off is probably a good thing 😄",2021-03-19 18:38:37

m8kft5,"I had a black jack table dealer try to do that to me a couple weeks ago.

 I'm 30, but had shaved for the first time in 5 years 😄...I was heated to say the least.

Although had the offer of free drinks been on the table I would have been a bit nicer to the guy, and just waited for the cops to get there lol.",2021-03-19 18:05:06
m8kft5,"Lol, i used to have my older brothers id on me in case i got carded.

I was a jackass kid who started drinking in bars when i was 17. Never once got kicked out and became friends with every bouncer i could.

(I used to bring girls from school with me sometimes. Walked in bars right passed the bouncers like i owned the place. One of the hottest girls in school... ""who the fuck are you?"" 🤣🤣



Lol, I grew up working, knew how to act around older people, and was mature as fuck.

Closest thing i ever got to being thrown out was
not being let in. 🤣 My brother had called me to meet him at a bar. Went there. The bouncer knew me... asked me for my id.

 ""Dude your brother is here right now. I can't let you in, but since your mom used to feed everyone when we were in high school, I'm letting you keep Chad's id, just go drink somewhere else.""

My brother and 8 other people left that bar right then and we went somewhere else.",2021-03-19 19:20:33
m8kft5,Lol.. wish I had these back when I worked the door.  Had one dumbass use the id of someone I worked with in my day job.  Insisted it was her until I explained that I worked with her sister and would return her id tomorrow at work.  The look on her face was priceless and her sister was fuckin livid the next day 🤣,2021-03-19 20:14:01
m8kft5,"Usually the “gonna kick you all out” is just a way to pressure a group to wrangle in their extreme friends.  Kicking out a whole group sucks, so just police your friends and it is fine. 😂",2021-03-19 18:19:25
m8kft5,"Once I got kicked out because they thought I was too drunk but in reality I just couldn’t walk on the ridiculous pin heels that I had just bought. My first time ever wearing heels. I was DD and have been drinking mineral water 🤣

Needles to say, I don’t wear heels. Wedges or flats (mostly sneakers) lol!

I was so angry though they pulled me in the back alley and told me to walk. I told them I can if I take the shoes off. They wouldn’t let me take them off. Then they just closed the door and that’s it. Left a young woman in a dark alley without even warning her friends. My phone and purse was still inside. I thought they were pulling me aside to talk to me about my friend’s behavior so I followed them blindly. Most ridiculous thing I have experienced. 

I already didn’t like going to bars and only went out on big occasions for friends. I stopped going all together after that.",2021-03-19 21:43:51
m8kft5,Congratulations 🎉🎈,2021-03-19 18:44:34
m8kft5,"Yeah, I’ve only been kicked out once and still don’t know why. Walked in with my friends, had two shots, went to the bathroom and on my way out the bouncer dragged me out by my collar and said girls complained about me lol
I thought maybe they mistook me from someone else so I tried the other door but that bouncer told me I could t come in either lol. Guess someone didn’t like me 🤷🏼‍♂️",2021-03-19 20:34:24

You can tell I've never done coke or been to a serious club 🤣",2021-03-19 21:21:01

a4el0r,"Describing something that is commonly as «Broken English™», or as «Broken [insert any other language here]», sounds like the kind of stuff dialects are disappearing over in a lot of places.

Contrary to what you apparently believe, language change does not need a specific reason to happen. But this does not mean that it is not allowed to happen. According to this idea, you should speak fucking Old English — with a couple of added words for modern inventions — but, I assume, you do not. Was there any reason for English grammar to change? Not really (no, cases are not too hard for people to learn). Did it happen anyway? Duh, obviously.

There have probably always been people with your mindset and those from past centuries would turn in their graves for your “correct” English lacks what was essential features to them. Almost every single difference between how you speak and how people used to speak comes from change that — in a lot of instances — was fought against by some people…",2018-12-09 09:01:55

You are gonna have some struggles but most the time you will forget you have it on. 

It sucks but it's awesome at the same time. 

If you can, talk to someone about it. 

I amputated at 19, 35 now, and wish I had been able to talk to someone who had gone through it before. 

Feel free to reach out to me. 

🍻




Edit: u/taltos1336 made a great point. If you can, find a prosthetist near your age and build a great relationship. I've had my prosthetic break at 10pm, and I was two hours away. He met me at midnight and fixed me right up. Plus when I lost my job, he made sure I was able to come to him or order new liners or whatever. He's really helped me during covid since I still don't have insurance

Edit #2: get your handicap placard and use the fuck out of it. I was 19 and felt like I was a young strong kid and if I had pants on, it looks like I took grandma's placard. I was confronted at a target before. Dude followed me in and out of the store to yell at me... It was not fun in the moment. 

Don't ever feel shame about parking in the handicap spot or using your disability to make your life a bit easier.",2021-07-28 16:02:18

I’ll throw it back to anyone who throws it up. I used to live in Hawaii so it’s probably not as applicable to most others, but to me it’s one of the most universally friendly gestures. I think more people from mainland US should incorporate this kind of ‘good day mate’ lifestyle, as anywhere east of Montana things  start to feel as they get more ‘hey fuck you bud’. It’s getting worse west of Montana as well, in the past decade with the constant influx of easterners moving out west. People just need to hang loose 🤙 ",2018-07-27 17:36:43

Probably didn't get caught, but if I did then he played the long game on giving me that book instead of calling me out. 🤣

nwvmhs,"Dude.  I think your invention is amazing.  But, as great as your 1st amendment is also. you need to be careful saying it’s patent pending if it isn’t.  

————————————————————————-
“When Do You Use a Patent Pending Notice?
You can only use the patent pending notice after your patent application is complete. This includes paying the application fee. It is not a term you can use freely. There is a penalty for saying ""patent pending,"" if the application has not been submitted yet.

If you state, ""patent pending"" before you have applied for a patent, you are committing fraud on the Patent Office. This comes with fines of up to $500 per case. That fine can add up quickly when dealing with high-volume goods.

This information is found in 35 U.S. Code 292(a) about false marking. The document states:

""Whoever marks upon, or affixes to, or uses in advertising in connection with any article, the words 'patent applied for,' 'patent pending,' or any word importing that an application for patent has been made, when no application for patent has been made, or if made, is not pending, for the purpose of deceiving the public — Shall be fined not more than $500 for every such offense. Only the United States may sue for the penalty authorized by this subsection.""”
———————————————————————————-

I doubt a parody defense would work, since this idea is far better than a lot of real patent applications and therefore arguably more “serious “.

Which only leaves one possibility.  You’ve already applied for your patent, in which case everything I said was unnecessary.  Enjoy your billions🤞",2021-06-10 21:10:12

The only way you can save your store is trying to find a hole in the market which is really hard. It may involve interviewing multiple people, doing surveys to find out what kind of designs people would want thats not available in most common stores. Or simply broadening your target audience. But that would mean changing your store’s name and everything it stands for also.",2019-12-17 21:11:38

From OP: 

“At friends apartment, Cops were called on us as a noise complaint multiple times by same neighbors, so cops kept coming by to sound check if we were too loud but always found us not loud.

The complex reeked with weed in the halls as well but we’re just drinking beers and smash in our boys place.

Finally, the cops come by once more but squad deep. We tell them we just drinkin and playing smash. They ask “what is smash?” So, I hear that from across the room and yelled back “y’all tryna play though, wanna catch these hands?!” Immediately, two cops raised their hands walking into the place asking how to play, but they were definitely acting stupid because one of them was actually good with Pikachu.

We talked some shit to each other, I say “just don’t fine me if I beat you.”

Fun times 🍻”",2018-12-12 01:46:53
a5cio7,"> Cops kept coming by to sound check if we were too loud but found us not loud

>
  
Aw man, I love gamers and hate shitty neighbors. I find this hilarious as their neighbors probably called because they were cheering and shit talking between rounds and every time the cops checked in, it was dead silence while they were in the middle of an intense round. 

I hope the cops got in on the end match shit talking. 

Neighbors look outside and see the cop cars out front... 😂",2018-12-12 02:35:34
a5cio7,"I tell the same to all the beginners. Learn how to block/dodge and learn edge play. If you get knocked off the stage don't just come back on. Be sneaky with that shit. Because I will know where you land unless you try to trick me.

Kirby is small, use the smash stick (right stick) for his strong moves. Kirby has a great left or right smash move.  His down smash is also great.  Kirby has a good grab too and you can do an up grab and combo it with an up b right after to get some nice damage.

But the key is don't be predictable. Learn to dodge and try to predict your opponent. Because of how light he is, you can stay in the stage even with high damage.

But on some real shit, fuck all the noise. Dedede is the true God emperor of smash. 🙏",2018-12-12 02:28:16

Edit: people seem to think I mean this negatively. I did not. Just because the artist is young does not mean they have to be described as aspiring.

I feel like publishing a  book of comics means they did it! They are in fact a comic artist! Its taken me 20+ years to achieve one of my art related goals, I'm glad this person can do it with the support of their parents. But I don't think they're aspiring. Maybe inspiring 😎",2021-04-18 21:40:45

My dad however was told the Xbox he had lent them money to buy was for me and my brother to share so he had bought me some video games for an Xbox I didn’t have. So he saved up and when he was able to, he bought me my own Xbox. 

My brother of course had already broken his Xbox beyond repair at this point though, so my parents grounded me and my punishment was having my Xbox taken away permanently and given to my brother. 🙃🖕🏻 I didn’t even get to play it. ",2018-01-09 13:22:04

p8art7,"> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Reddit. The knowledge is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of political science most of the articles will go over a typical reader's head. There's also r/funny's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their shitposting - this personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. True Redditors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these posts, to realize that they're not just informative- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Reddit truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the ennui in r/Prequelmemes' existential catchphrase ""hello there,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Reddit's geniuses unfold themselves on their phone screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Reddit tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",2021-08-20 20:39:32

p8art7,"Jokes aside, I truly think Reddit is the *only* social media that isn't poisoning our population. I'm not going to say Reddit is ""good"" but I will say that it doesn't promote false body images like Instagram, it doesn't provide people with a false sense of worth like Instagram or Twitter based on the amount of followers you have, and it doesn't promote fake news like Facebook. 

Reddit allows you to cater to your own interests and that's that. They don't push any sort of sponsored users or content. There are a few people like u/Gallowboob or u/Schnoodledoodledo that have ""Reddit fame,"" but for the most part the famous Redditors only post quality content that has nothing to do with themselves. Even u/Gallowboob has asked people to contribute the money they spend to award his posts to charity instead. 

Anyways, 🍌 for scale.",2021-08-20 23:06:41

Seeing people walking and spot it.. and kinda look around to see if its ""safe"" to ""steal"" it and then as they walk try and bend down and pick it up in like one motion only to trip and stumble when they cant is flipping hilarious.

Some guy also brought in these like religious ""ads"" that when folded looked like 20 dollar bills and 100 dollar bills.

This guy was such a troll. Hed fold em up and make em look like real deal money and leave them laying around and wed sit and watch people pick em up.

One guy even threw his hat on the floor over it, then picked his hat up along with the bill.

Then you get to watch the dissapointment when they check it out 🤣🤣🤣

This guy would also take like a dollar and tape fishing line to it you couldnt see. Hed sit in a cubicle and put it in the hallway near it and wait for someone to come along and try and grab it.

Whoooops gotta be quicker than that!

Ive honestly considered buying like the fake 100 dollar bills amazon has that look super real ( have like made for movie printed on them ) but look SUPER real. Come in a bundle that look like you got 10k.

the human brought the boxes - he was looking for ‘accept’

i was there to Greet him, (it was Pets that i expect…)

he asked if i was ‘FaMiLy‘ - i wagged my tail with Joy ^;@)

he knew that he could trust me

n that’s when he said

‘*Good Boy’*

i had to leave a pawprint, cuz he said i need to ‘sign’

(it kinda came out messy, but he told me it looks fine)

i hope i made you happy, friend, my Proud i cannot hide!

Im a server, and people are quitting at my job to the point that soon we’ll probably have to close the dining room and just do to-go orders. It’s not that the business isn’t there, in July we broke sales records, the highest sales in a month since the restaurant opened nine years ago.

ixleej,"We live in Dallas, Texas and have been in our neighborhood for 24 years now. First year, we only had a few, maybe less than 10 trick-or-treaters. We started decorating and over the next couple of years, the numbers went up. Then we got some other folks along the street who started decorating too. Now, we have over 600 kids come by. We hand out glow necklaces to everyone (even the parents usually want one) which I buy online direct from a factory. We also have candy for everyone and we have had a haunted house set up on our porch for many years, plus yard decorations. It’s always a blast. We have not had any leftovers in years as we are usually out of necklaces and candy by 8:30 and we have to shut down. The only downside is my hands will be sore for a week from activating all the necklaces 🙂",2020-09-28 04:01:14

At one point I was crossing the Ribera de Manzanares and it started... snowing. It was magical. This must have been in late October of that year, and I couldn’t believe it. I scooped some up and made a little snow man in the front yard before heading in for a few hours of sleep (lol)

When I woke up, the snowman had of course melted away.

jp9wwp,"Probably yes because of shadows and lightning. Good chroma key setups (including the green screen/wall, lighting, and camera) are tuned to key out a very specific, narrow range of green. If the luminance (light level) or saturation changes/goes out of range, the chroma key falls apart. Simple shadows and dark spots start to look like static in the overlayed image.

Typically the green wall is lit separately so that the colors are more offset and things happening in the foreground don't cast shadows.

So in this example you'd probably see at least the shadows of the assailants and the weather graphic would be breaking apart/fuzzing wherever they were. Depending on the sensitivity of the chroma key and how close their green matches, they might not even be cut out at all.

But still a very fun concept for a comic; I love it op 😄

edit to add: using green suits for special effects is totally a thing; even green suits on green backgrounds for puppet operators. Here's some really basic examples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCCEsYmYLkg  
But a TV weather set definitely isn't setup in that capacity. In chroma set like this you'd be doing everything you can to not allow your foreground subject (weather reporter) to be keyed out including using magenta or amber lights to drift any of the foreground colors further away from green.

also: [example in this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/jp9wwp/the_perfect_crime/gbdmpmg/) is a perfect find!",2020-11-06 19:49:19

Here's how it works, your cosmic chelonian carries it through the cosmos (a sun and moon orbit it. They're spheres, don't be ridiculous. A flat moon.

i wish you simple pleasures, friend

a lazy afternoon to spend

no worries hanging over you,

no politics or covid flu

no chores to do or bills to pay,

just watch the innocent 

at play

two animals without a care,

of human problems - unaware

as round they go,  in circles run

n endless chase - they're having Fun!

we humans 'run in circles', too

with way too much we have to do

so watch them, carefree! without stress

i hope it brings you

Happiness

kl953e,"> If you put the fixings underneath the patty it cooks them

Lol, no it doesn't.  Besides, you seem to have misinterpreted ""the lettuce"" as ""everything but the patty and bun.""

Turns out ""the lettuce"" doesn't mean ""all of the fixings.""

.

> You want a tomato that goes down like jelly in your mouth?

Nobody said to put the tomato down there.

Besides, actually, yes.  Try oven roasting your tomatoes some time.  It's marvelous.

If your lettuce is getting waterlogged, try not using cheap lettuce, or letting the hamburger sit around for half an hour.

If you ask me to choose between wet lettuce (lettuce is 90% water) and a wet bun, I'll choose wet lettuce every time.

.

> You want to swallow- you like tomato jelly in your mouth, that’s what you like?

Yes, who would ever put a jelled tomato based substance on a hamburger? 

Next you'll say someone has used marinated cucumbers 😶

.

> The patty cooks the lettuce which sogs the bun, which compromises the entire structural integrity of the burger!

So ... don't put something inbetween the bun and the patty to slow sogging, ... because it'll eventually get sogged?

I guess I feel like you haven't really thought this through.

Good burger joints do this for a reason.  Better luck next time",2020-12-27 20:42:56

My hair is also SUPER thick so it takes me a few minutes to really get the shampoo through my entire scalp. Then it takes longer to rinse out, etc etc. Shaving my under arms and legs also adds time to my shower. My showers in the winter are functionally quicker because I don’t shave my legs between November and April 😂",2021-03-29 19:51:08

I cried, I laughed, I hugged my gf so tight.

It was so good!!
The show is one of the things that moments after meeting, my gf and I clicked on, and we got to binge the final season on her 30th birthday!! When we first met, she made me a playlist, and Precious Love, the song the boys were married to, was all over it. It makes me cry, every time I hear it, and then I just smile like the LARGEST GOON.

Schitts Creek is simply one of the best examples of a GREAT television show. Just SO PERFECTLY DONE. Watching the bts, too, is its own waterworks show, if you wanna cry for just oooone more hour...

Im glad I got to watch it (: (:

sory5d,"One question… what rank is a Sargeant?

Here in the UK we have Privates, Corporals, SERGEANTS and the rest… but no SARGEants.. but if you even said or mentioned “Sarge” in the slightest whisper you would be torn a new one. 😝 

Note: Might have just been a quirk of my Sqn. You could shorten Staff Sergeant to just “Staff”. But I heard one recruit say Sarge the one time and I’m surprised the wasn’t blown through the building by the enthusiastic advice from Staff Sergeant Stewart on what happens to recruits who call him Saaaaaarge. 

I had the same when at pay parade I called the pay officer “Maaaam’ after I enthusiastically stomped to a halt and my boot caught under the edge of the table… Oops… Storm Force Stewart incoming. 

“SHE IS NOT YOUR MOTHER YOU HORRIBLE PIEC…”

“That’s enough Staff Sergeant. No harm done.”

Thankfully the officer (lovely lady) had called off the pit bull with a smirk she was trying to hide. You can never face Storm Force Stewart… that is, unless you are an officer above the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. 😂",2022-02-10 02:30:47

ybhxui,"So many comments here, but I don't see the one that REALLY explains this anywhere...

The whole reason restaurants create kids menus, is to make it more affordable for families to eat out. It is not always cheaper because it's a smaller portion, but more so to keep the price of the entire bill lower. 

I have worked in restaurants for over 30 years, and every so often I would find myself having to explain this to an adult trying to order the kids burger and fries. It's the same burger as on the adult menu, just cheaper. They weren't looking for a smaller portion, just a cheaper price. So no- our restaurant would not allow adults to order from the kids menu, unless a child was actually present. 

But... the really pushy people would ALWAYS try. They would then ask for the chicken fingers, because of course, they ARE a smaller portion. And I would then direct them to the appetizer menu. Yeah, after 30+ years I've probably heard it all...

It's no different than restaurants that advertise kids eat free- it's a way to lure families in to enjoy a meal together at a more affordable price. You wouldn't expect to eat free as an adult, would you? 

I know this post references who handled it better, but I'd say they both failed, because neither one explained WHY they can't have a kids meal, only that they couldn't because they aren't a kid. People tend to accept rules better when they are able to understand the reason WHY. 

Hope this clears the air a little. 😁",2022-10-23 18:11:08

**In 46 years of liberation, Kon Tum has changed from a battlefield to a peaceful town**

Today is the 46th anniversary of the liberation of Kon Tum. The situation of the liberation of Kon Tum back then was very fierce, and it is still vividly visible today.

📷 

On March 16, the 304th Battalion defeated the retreating enemy troops in the St. Maipas area; Vietnamese troops occupied parts of the vicinity of Kon Tum and the capital of the Datu region, approaching Kon Tum town from all directions, thereby encircling the north and east. The enemy; at the same time, troops in the southwest disarmed the enemy, attacked Sinmian Village, and blocked the southern part of Dabra Bridge. That night, all the armed forces of Kon Tum Province combined with the F968 main force to attack Kon Tum, destroying the enemy's armed forces and quickly occupying the entire Kon Tum. Kon Tum Town is the political center of Kon Tum Province and the last refuge for the defeated Kon Tum enemies in Vietnam. Since then, the liberation flag has been flying over Kon Tum, and Kon Tum Province has declared its liberation!📷 📷

**And just over a month before the liberation of Kontum, the enemy forces are still struggling to death despite the declining trend of retreat. Some files intuitively reflect the panic of the reactionary enemy forces that have reached the end.** At that time, the enemy ruler in the Kon Tum area declared that “in view of the tense situation, the Kon Tum area should enter a wartime state”. According to relevant data, the enemy will impose the death penalty on all persons in eight situations, including spreading rumors to confuse the crowd and gathering riots. This harsh law reflects the despair and panic of the enemy army facing the end.📷 📷

**The impressive overall figures of Kunsong province's economic situation in 2020 truly reflect Kunsong's development.**

In the past 5 years (2016 to 2020), Kon Tum Province has allocated more than 7,681 billion VND for investment in the development of the economic zone. Up to now, 153 investment projects have been registered in the Boi International Border Economic Zone, Hòa Bình, Đắk La, Sao Mai, Măng Đen and other industrial parks and industrial clusters, with a total registered capital of more than 888.6 billion VND. Especially in the first six months of 2020, the province has attracted 16 investment projects with a total registered capital of more than 4,645 billion VND. In 2018-2019, it attracted large investors and economic groups, such as Vingroup, TH True Milk Group... Research and investment in high-tech agriculture; hotel complex, trade and service center; wind energy and energy in the three economic zones Solar power project. Recently, a series of investment promotion activities have been carried out at home and abroad, attracting the attention of many enterprises and entrepreneurs with economic potential in local potential fiels.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, visited the ginseng planting area on Yulin Mountain above 2,000m above sea level in Tumorong County, Kon Tum Province

Regarding foreign investment projects, as of now, Kon Tum Province has a total of 363 projects permitted to invest in economic and industrial zones, of which 334 are valid projects with a total investment of US$5,868.3 billion. Kontum’s outstanding efforts in promoting and attracting investment, as well as its rigorous measures in administrative reform and improvement of the investment environment, have achieved positive results, creating a prerequisite for the formulation of the next more radical and solid goal.

📷

According to statistics, the total value of Kon Tum products reached 1,4782 billion VND (an increase of 9.96% from 2018). Per capita income increased from VND 37.35 million in 2018 to VND 41.28 million in 2019; the province’s national budget revenue exceeded 3,124 billion VND, exceeding the planned 26.3%. Four communes reached the new rural standards; the forest coverage rate reached 62.78%...📷 📷

After the liberation of Kon Tum, the government took the protection and improvement of people’s livelihood as the starting point and goal of economic and social development, and introduced a series of policies to promote the social and economic development of Kon Tum, leading the people of Kon Tum to move the former battlefield of Kon Tum to today’s peace. A prosperous city shows the core concept of ""people-oriented"" of the Communists, and truly seeks happiness for the people.",2021-03-22 08:59:36

Likewise, this one is actually created by taking 😮 U+1F62E FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH, a ZWJ, and the penis hieroglyph (U+130B8: EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH D052) with a emoji variant selector (U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16).

Optionally, gender and skin color can be specified using the usual modifiers and ZWJ sequences. Skin color can be applied separately to face and the penis hieroglyph, although platform support for this is limited since that part is usually not rendered.",2020-01-31 01:02:19

10j1gts,"Well played sir! Reminds me of a story from years ago. 

My roommate in college had a gf he was going strong with. They had a habit of studying till late night like 2-3 am and then having loud sex around 4 am, which would almost always wake me up. I am a deep sleeper but they were pretty loud, with her practically screaming “Yes, right there, <his name>, un huh un huh.” She would always finish with “oh yes yes yes yes ….yes!” Always 4 yes’s followed by an emphatic yes. And then take a shower before going to sleep. 

For context, we had one other roommate (a girl, let’s call her Emma), who had mentioned being annoyed by this. Emma was a nice girl, very respectful and studious, but kept to herself so i didn’t know her super well. We all had been roomies for around three months when this happened.

Once, the night after I had had a week of final assignments and tests due, I was finally getting some sleep, and sure enough, at 4:10 am, was woken up by loud moans of “Yes, right there, <his name>, un huh un huh.” I was a bit pissed, and wanted to give them a piece of my mind so walked out of my bedroom, rubbing my eyes. As I step out, who else is standing outside her bedroom door, but Emma, in her pajamas, rubbing her eyes and looking pissed. We looked at each other, and not sure what happened there, but next I know, she just walked to me and said, “let’s pretend we are having sex and be louder than them, that should shut them up for good.” Within a few seconds, we were outside the humping roommates’ bedroom door, lightly banging against it, just making loud moaning noises and random dirty talk “oh yeah, you like that baby”, “oh yes, do me right against this door”, “I want to feel you deep inside me”. We could literally hear them stop dead in their tracks, as they realized they could be heard clearly outside. About a minute later, with the job well done, both of us began returning to our respective rooms. Which is when Emma just drags me to her room by hand, takes off her pajamas, and begins making out furiously. Not sure what had gotten into her but she was wild. Within minutes, we were on her bed, humping like bunnies, and ironically, being super loud. It was a memorable night. 

It was super fun trying to make eye contact with our roommate and his gf the next morning 😂",2023-01-23 18:31:49

When I got there she had just thought about unplugging and replugging the oven, but to no avail. Remember, this is a safety feature. So I go over to the oven and longpress the clock and minus button. Nothing happens. So I longpress the time and plus button. Unlocks after a few seconds. Success! Show her how it's done, set the time and on my way.

ss6psr,"Dude YES!  When I read that conspiracy theory, I was like… there are so many pieces of evidence, this one is probably true. 
Like how the Titanic had a nearly identical (but much older) nearly identical but slightly smaller twin ship, I think it was the ~~Britannia?~~ Olympic. 

And conveniently, her insurance was expired and un-renewable, so if anything bad happened to her, the company who owned her wouldn’t get an insurance payout.  But the Titanic had a huge fancy insurance policy, which would pay out big big big money, if the ship was destroyed.  (And, Hmmm, why would the owners feel the need to purchase a freaking gigantic expensive insurance policy, a “just in case the ship is destroyed policy”, on the ship they advertised as “unsinkable”???) 

So if the Olympic got destroyed, the company wouldn’t receive insurance money.  So there was a huge financial incentive to switch the Titanic and the Olympic and pull some insurance fraud. 

And the way that many dock workers who watched the launch said it was the Olympic who really launched, not Titanic.  There was some design differences between the two boats, visible more trained people who worked around boats.  Someone just slapped the Titanic name on the Olympic, but the bow shape and some other stuff was wrong for being the “Titanic”, and multiple eye-witnesses familiar with both boats swear it was the Olympic who was launched. 

And the dock workers said lifeboats were purposefully pulled off the ship, and that many people spoke out against it, but it was done anyway. “Orders from above.” 

And most condemning—the way that there was a group of wealthy bankers, owners of the ship company, who were scheduled to be passengers on the voyage.  They also invited all their wealthy friends and their enemies, to the luxurious ship for a grand party.  It was a famous banker’s party.  Anyone who was anyone in the banking world, would be at that party. 

And then at the last minute—the individuals who owned the ship and who were literally hosting the party—they ditched the voyage and didn’t get on the ship.  Right before departure.  Without telling this to any of their guests.  They just “decided not to go”—but didn’t tell anyone they didn’t like, so conveniently all their disliked guests were still on board the “Titanic.” 

All the guests who were their enemies were left behind on the ship. 

And everyone who was friends and in cahoots with this one wealthy banking group, they conveniently decided “not to get on the ship” at the last minute. 

The ship that they’d conveniently also removed most of the life boats from. With the huge “unnecessary” insurance policy they just purchased.  
🙄🙄🙄🙄

Yeah. Uh-huh. Sure. “Accident.”  

Not to mention the survivor accounts who state that they witnessed crew locking people below deck as the ship was sinking.  Even the movie Titanic got that chilling detail right. 

Someone wanted there to be as few survivors from that shipwreck as possible. (For less eye-witnesses, perhaps?) 

After their competition died, those bankers who conveniently didn’t board the Titanic…essentially had a monopoly in place.",2022-02-14 13:54:37

EXPLANATION FOR WHAT HAPPENED TODAY 👇FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS👇

”The trade volume was low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays

WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game. This is a war of attrition, but one side (us) does not have a financial penalty for staying on the battlefield, the other side (those with short positions) do.

Water molecules are 0.275 nanometers in size, while the coronavirus at its smallest is 60 nanometers. Water can't even be trapped in paper towel, so it's impossible for something 218 times it's size to be trapped in paper towel, let alone an N95 mask.

And what's best is that since the person isn't actually disabled, it's not like you're making fun of a disabled person so it's not offensive. Since you're just *joking* that they're disabled. Which is totally different and not at all mocking disabled people.

10abta6,"Lmao! My husband recently needed to mail a package and scheduled a postal pickup. He explicitly requested the mail carrier ring the doorbell so I could hand them the package (many times mail carriers have ignored my pickup request when I leave the package outside by the door for them to pickup). Well, mail carrier walked towards our door, stopped a few steps from the porch and ran back to her truck. By the time I ran outside she was long gone within seconds. Never rang the doorbell or anything. On top of that my husband got an email confirmation that his package had been “successfully” picked up 😂",2023-01-13 04:19:26

10abta6,"I couldn’t get them to do anything about the watches and neither could AT&T. It was a Black Friday week bogo sale and I had to order them a second time the same day, which made funds really tight but I have a heart condition which I wanted to use the watch to monitor. It took over a month for the AT&T warehouse to mark them received and around the same time an AT&T rep screwed our account up so we didn’t have access to it and we were charged for all four watches for three months 🤬",2023-01-13 04:48:25
10abta6,"Relax. I WAS HER when younger. I know how that feels. We live in a third world country, no such thing as ""special class"". I take her to therapy weekly even though we're struggling to afford those just so she can cope and manage and socialize better. How do you think we get the IQ results & analysis? We know what to do but the world isn't always ideal and she also has to learn to coexist with the rest of the world. Reaching the balance of mental health and survival isn't always as easy as in the more advanced countries and if we treat her as ""different"", she sure will have harder time handling the impact of ""ordinary"" outside world. What if her future boss is an actual idiot - is she entitled to work only in ""special"" department? And so on. Besides, I also work closely with her and already recognized her needs of stimulation since birth. I always know what's best for my kids 😉 thanks for your concern though.",2023-01-13 04:29:43

He was just interested in watching DS9, but there's several episodes of TNG that actually tie into some of the character arcs, so I included some TNG as kind of a 'prequel' season for him.

Caveat: there's always going to be differences in any list you find, but this is the one I've stuck with after multiple rewatches, since DS9 is basically my favorite show of all time.

https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/7nzdnk/deep_space_nine_selected_episodes/

Edit - the Season 2 TNG episode 'Q Who' should also definitely be on there, right at the beginning. Must have left that off the list by mistake since I'd already watched it with my friend I originally made this list for. Fun to find a mistake on 2+ year old post of mine 🤦‍♂️",2020-07-23 15:17:21

sbybe1,"I worked for a tile contractor, part time.  He had a contract to install all of the ceramic tile wall dividers at the airport food court, as well as all ceramic flooring.   I ended up working more hours at this part time job, than I did my full time job...  The lady who was the ""contractor"", had a very high powered attorney for a husband.  You can see where this is going....  Every week, she moved up the completion date required.    Once the last piece of tile was layed, she never paid another penny of what she owed on the contract....   She said ""good luck"", when he threatened a court action.   Of course, her high powered atty. husband will take her case on gratis, and bleed the contractor dry over time, in the courts....   These are surely the first to die during the inevitable revolution...  He ate tens of thousands in losses, ended up divorced, went bankrupt, and had to start all over again.

To be fair we don’t know the home owners side here

When we landscaped our house, we got an exact quote which was around $20k (itemized for each line item we asked would cost X)

The workers and owner were at our house multiple times, no talk or extra pay was discussed 

Then at the end we got emailed an invoice for $3K for the extra work

I refused to pay and asked for an itemized invoice if everything including the original $20K

I never heard back

I don’t think the coming was being malicious or trying to screw me, just unorganized

Then, of course, they always seem surprised that same nobody showed up for half a day's work, did it noticeably intoxicated, then fucked off with the half they paid upfront.

Lil Pump’s self-titled mixtape “Lil Pump” is an invaluable chronicle of the “rockstar lifestyle”, as well as a window into his life, and his subtle yearning for a deeper meaning in his life. It chronicles his travel into stardom, and his relationships created from his fame, to his doubts that this is the correct lifestyle for him, and concluding with his decision to take this path, for better, or for worse. “Lil Pump” provides an accurate depiction of the steps into the famous lifestyle, and the feelings created through it.
To begin, Lil Pump’s rise to fame, and into the ‘rockstar lifestyle’, bring him many relationships, sexual, friendly, and otherwise. For example, the second song on the mixtape, “Gucci Gang”, contains lyrics such as “I fuck a bitch I forgot her name”, which depicts the depth of his romantic relationships, and how they often lack meaning, and are just shallow releases, without any depth. Along with his intrapersonal relationships, “Gucci Gang” also shows his drug use, a product of his fame, stating, “My lean cost more than your rent”(Gucci Gang), lean being a mix of codeine-containing cough syrup, and Mountain Dew, a common southern hip-hop trope. This is the first step into the “rockstar lifestyle”: Entry, consisting of shallow relationships and copious drug use.
As his descent into the spotlight continues, Pump’s position on his decision begins to become indecisive. At times, he feels some regrets to the path he decided to take. Most importantly, Lil Pump may yearn for lasting, monogamous relationships, and perhaps may wish to settle down someday, have one boy and one girl, and a stable home in the suburbs. To support this, Lil Pump references the same woman in two songs. In “Crazy”, Pump states “That bitch she swallow my baby, bought me a brand new Mercedes, ooh”(Crazy). He references “Crazy” in “Back”, Pump saying, “I just bought a brand new Mercedes”(Back). Although it is possible they are different women, I believe Lil Pump is still referencing the female from “Crazy”, as the Mercedes reference implies that the songs are close on the Lil Pump Expanded Universe Timeline™. Lil Pump’s hidden yearning for a lasting relationship is extremely important in understanding the ultra-famous, and how they are people, just like us. Outside of the album, Pump may also be becoming less risky with his lifestyle(BBC News). The return to humanity, and missing deep relationships, is the second step into stardom: Depth, the return to life before the “rockstar lifestyle”, and the true pleasures to be had with real, true relationships.
The third, and final step of one’s descent into stardom, is their final decision: Continue into fame, or to exit out of the spotlight. Pump’s decision was clear and simple: Although he had some regrets, this was the lifestyle for him. The last few songs on the mixtape clearly prove this. Track “Molly” is an obvious reference to his consumption of MDMA, and the hook of his track “D Rose”, is a clear reference to expensive watches, an almost cliche theme in modern hip-hop. Pump had made his final decision, with the outro of the mixtape being a clear representation of the direction of his career. The final decision. The final step.
To conclude, Lil Pump’s mixtape “Lil Pump” is an ideal, perfect representation of the career of any media-megastar™’s path towards their place in the spotlight, and the decision’s they are forced to make while taking such a path. Also, although Pump may seem to be a shallow, sex and drug centered person, this album shows his real inside, and how he is truly a deep and caring person, but puts up walls with his exterior.",2018-01-04 09:57:59

Why not save yourself time and not put it on your sandwich at all?

As for Ed Sheeran, I know he’s supposedly a lovely guy and he may be talented, but every one of his songs I’ve heard sounds like Muzak so I found this post and many of the comments terribly funny.

Like maybe 60% of people were social distancing and using the stickers on the floor (so about as high as you can expect from Americans) but the dumb hairline at tsa kept waving and gently assisting us to cram right in next to each other. I spoke with a different tsa against, they told me the supervisor talks to him about it at least once a day. 🙄

Then on my overbooked flight they kept telling me the same lie: ""your safety is our top priority."" On an overbooked flight, in a pandemic. But then, at the end of the day I'm the jackass who got on an airplane, so 🤷🏻‍♂️ maybe we're all just dumb.",2021-01-02 14:53:38

And then they finally brought someone from another store into the full-time management position and she immediately started getting bonuses based on store performance and I got nothing extra, even though I had been busting my ass for the store. Not that she didn't deserve bonuses, she was very good at her job, but I felt that I deserved then as well for putting up with an insane schedule while Corporate took their sweet-ass time finding someone for our store.

k4nuat,"I drove a PE temp crazy with this. They had a game in a small square where one person with a ball should touch 3 others with the ball to win. The others could free each other. Loosingparty does pushups.  The square was stupdily small, so the team of 3 always had to do pushups. I assume that was planned.

I won with my team of 3 twice, only ones in the class. First time I grabbed the ball-toucher and held him tight, making sure to not touch the ball. Just waited out the time. Second time I punched the ball out of his hands, sending it across the room, when he retrieved it time was out. The others had plenty time to free me.

Did a 360 in the middle of the turnpike and flew off the road and wrapped my car around a tree. I don’t really remember much more, but thankfully I had two witnesses that stopped and one even got her plates. The trooper was then able to go to her work and arrest her for fleeing the scene of an accident as well as driving with a suspended license and no car insurance. Her excuse was that I flipped her off after moving over so she could pass cuz she was tailgating me when I was passing another car. Moral of the story, the trooper told me to be careful cuz there’s crazy people out there like her 😂",2018-05-01 14:40:54

czc8ka,"The first time I had ever gone through one of these, my best friend told me I had to go around twice before I could exit. I was probably 25 and had never seen a roundabout in my life, so I didn't question it. 

Fast forward 6 years and I'm in a city where they're EVERYWHERE. I had successfully avoided them, until one day I was driving with another friend in an attempt to familiarize me with the city, and we enter a roundabout. Like I'm seeing a spirit Yoda, I recall the info provided by my bff and I go around twice. We exit the roundabout and I'm feeling mighty proud of myself for conquering my anxiety over it and then I notice the look on my buddy's face. 

Turns out, you don't have to go around it twice to exit. 🤷‍♀️",2019-09-04 10:37:57

I know I only check my camera for deliveries when something's wrong. Like the time I found the packages in the middle of my front yard. Turned out it was just the wind, but it was funny to watch it start to roll away. 😂",2018-11-08 20:42:44
9vcgfw,"Ah yes FedEx... 

Ordered a rackmount UPS, instructed the eBay seller to send no sing required because I actually work for a living and my neighborhood is good etc.

Day of expected delivery arrives, nothing. I check the tracking and it says delivered two days prior. Check the two cameras covering my driveway and the third covering my porch. Not only was there no delivery but no FedEx truck passed my home. I inform the seller so he can bitch, I put the video on a site where he can view it. FedEx opens an “investigation”, sellers rep tells him he’s worked there for YEARS and never heard of a misdelivered package (lol). They don’t find it and the driver tells them he delivered it - 2nd house on the left! Me and the seller are unhappy.

I come home the next day and lo and behold TWO packages on my porch, one of,which stands shoulder high. WTF?! The UPS is there, the second package is a foam mattress for a man with the same house number but a street on the other side of town 🙄

I call FedEx to inform them I have good news and bad news. My package has mysteriously appeared, bad news is some other schmuck is wondering where the hell his mattress is. FedEx asks me what I’m going to do with the mattress, this is puzzling to me since duh it’s NOT my property. I inform them I’m sliding further under my porch eave so it won’t get wet from the coming rain and that it will be there for them to pickup - lady sounds relieved. Like, do people keep misdelivered stuff as retribution or something?

I pull the video for that day. Big FedEx truck backs into driveway and little dude struggles to get the UPS to my doorstep, he then drives away. 30mins later he pulls up on the street, same guy, tips this big box over to read and ch3ck the address, and proceeds to drag THAT beast all the way down my driveway and stands it right next to th package he delivered 30mins before. I couldn’t believe it, how could he miss that he’d already been there and not wonder? Where the heck had my UPS been for like 5 days?! I’ll never know but boy was the seller relieved when I let him know the silly package had arrived. I told him to let his dumbass rep know that I’d not only had a misdelivered package but that I’d had TWO on the same damn day! Sheesh!",2018-11-08 22:41:44
9vcgfw,I hate when they knock bc I have loud ass dogs but it totally looks like he gives a quick knock before leaving. I thought he was being genuine and a little silly once he saw the camera. I walk dogs for a living and a few clients have entryway cameras and I will always do a cheesy smile / wave type thing. Kinda instinct when you think someone's watching ya 🤷‍♀️,2018-11-08 20:24:08

We go to the restroom I pee on her and apparantly this turned her on and she started going down on me right after. Ended up banging it out and when we were done she said her sting didn't hurt anymore. Moral of the story... pee and sex are good for jelly stings 😁,2020-10-29 00:06:53

i4jao3,"Normally when you go against a USB cable you got a 50/50 chance of getting it in right the first time. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal. So you got 25% chance at best of getting it in right. Then you add a lightning cable to the mix, and your chances drastic go down. See these three connections, you got a 33 1/3 chance of doing it right, but I've got a 66 2/3 chance, cause that lightning cable knows its going in right, and it's not even gonna try.

So you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25% chance and you've got an 8 1/3 chance of getting this cable in right. But then you take my 75% chance of getting it in right if the lightning cable isn't a factor, and then add 66 2/3 percents, I got 141 2/3 chance of getting the USB in on the first try.

See, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you, when I'm charging my phone.

The crying girl in question was part of a group that crammed themselves into the pit after it had been packed for hours and decided to fill in the gaps folks had made to allow people to walk past toward the bathrooms/water. There was a line of people interlocked single file trying to get to the bathrooms and these girls just parked themselves in the temporary path and didn’t keep going. 

After taking several elbows to the gut and getting literally stomped on when the show started back up I told the girl nearest me that she was ruining our concert experience and their group needed to keep going and not keep shoving into us. I’m pretty sure she was rolling on molly because she immediately broke down into tears and not the kind seeking to gain sympathy. I felt bad about it but thankfully they finally got the message that they weren’t welcome amongst us that close (literally standing on top of us) and needed to go.

Edit: Because you blocked me like a coward…

Nah, it was a pop concert and not a mosh pit. And this entire group was taller than us and tried using that to assert themselves when we were clearly pissed they didn’t keep moving.

9ixvzf,"I loved stealing hoodies. Men’s hoodies are the best. There’s something about them belonging to a significant other that makes them better. I’m obviously not the only one who feels that way lol. 

But my karma came back, because I cannot keep my son out of my hoodies. He just snags them for school, no matter how much I’ve protested. They are men’s hoodies. I buy him his own. I buy him fallout/Minecraft/Rick and Morty. All the things he’s into. All the things he says “Awesome!” to when he sees them. They lay on his bedroom floor, meanwhile he’s wearing my cheap old navy boring blue hoodie to school every day. I can ask why, he doesn’t know. There’s just something about snagging the hoodie of a loved one that is apparently just too tempting. 

The best one was when my sister moved in. She has this cheap Walmart plain blue hoodie. He comes home from school wearing it, and she’s like “hey, that’s mine!” He’s like, oh really? He found it on the hook and assumed it was his. How could he assume something he’s never seen or worn, that no one gave him, was his? The kid’s a goofball. He also kept wearing it every day anyways. 😂",2018-09-26 04:32:55

One thing that always drove me nuts is when they THOUGHT they could math and the total didn't match up.

I did two of the following things and never got a complaint:

If the tip was lower than the total, just punched in the tip they wrote in.

If the tip was higher, I just lowered the tip to match their total.

I worked at one place where, if the customer had already left before I saw the mistake, we *had* to go by the total, no matter how much the tip was. Unless, of course, the total gave us MORE than the tip they wrote. Then, magically, we had to go by the tip & the manager just initialled it. 

Almost like they wanted to make sure us servers didnt make more than their measly salary. That job taught me to ~~not~~ report all my tips 🥰

I’m not an academic, but I will say that until all of you ban together, make some hard findings on all this, get the support of people of notoriety, write letters to express issue in this and quite literally cause a lot of upheaval on this issue very publicly, it won’t change.  It’s clear all you researchers deserve to be paid by anyone who publishes and profits off of your work.   

If even one of you researchers reads this and if any of you have it in you to figure out a way to make a community based app for researchers with an accompanying website, I highly suggest taking your power back!  You could easily create a community if you all worked together and who knows.. maybe create your own peer driven journals to celebrate and educate in your fields.    

Also if anyone gets wealthy off this idea remember me. 😗

But seriously you deserve to get paid.  It is a funny video but it makes me feel bad you researchers are getting used and not supported.

A tall older gentleman in a suede jacket was with his family and I asked if he could take a picture of us. He looked a bit confused but said sure. He was laughing as so were his family. Well he took the picture and I said thank you.  I got back to my seats and met up with the rest of my friends. One of them said “did you see Clint Eastwood?” And I said no... and you can see where this is going.. he said “right there in the front. In the brown jacket” and yup. It was the man who took the picture for us. I guess he and Jamie Cullum wrote the theme song for Gran Torino and that’s why he was there.

I jumped into the water and was told what to do. After 30 secs I was frantically praying someone would tell me to swim back to the boat. I stayed calm, enjoyed about 20% (the rest of the time I was frantically scanning the oceans depths for the manta who was going to eat me). I was constantly afraid but emerged (after they told me to move to the boat -YES!) a little more confident in myself. I think the manta rays taught me all I need to know so I will not be joining them again 😬",2020-08-13 01:05:51

Like Yoda says he’s 900 years old, but he doesn’t know about how quickly the planet Earth rotates around the sun. So like is the 900 years old 900 times Dagobah rotated around its star? (I know Yoda isn’t from Dagobah, but for arguments sake).

His 900 years old could be 200 earth years or 10,000 earth years. Who knows?

fad2x8,But... what does a planet have to do with how long it takes to circle the sun? 😜,2020-02-28 01:10:31
fad2x8,"A day is one rotation, a year is one revolution. 

Rotating means it's spinning around itself, think of a top or a coin spinning on a table, those are rotating. Earth takes 24 hours to make one rotation, Venus takes 5,832 hours to make one rotation (243 Earth days). ***However, as u/GuilhermeFreire pointed out in a reply, Venus rotates the opposite direction as Earth does. So while it takes 243 Earth days to rotate once, it only takes 116 days for the sun to return to its same spot in Venus' sky. ***

Revolving is what we think about when the planets are orbiting the sun, or really any object. On Earth this takes 365 Earth days. On Venus, one revolution takes 225 Earth days.

~~So since it takes 243 Earth days to just rotate once, but only 225 Earth days to revolve once, its days are longer than its years!~~

Believe me, if it ever happens to you, you'll no longer think of it as a windfall.

7lbf0x,"To be fair, you have to have a very high midichlorian count to understand the prequels. The plot is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of poetry most of the plot will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Anakin’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Sith literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the plot, to realise that it’s not just a story-it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the prequels truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Anakin’s existential catchphrase “This is where the fun begins,” which itself is a cryptic reference to the Big’s Chinese epic Backstroke of the West. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as George Lucas’ genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Qui-Gon tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2017-12-21 21:42:07

The third time they thought they found an improperly seated seal and fixed that too, but it has been dry since then until the past week or so. I’m just hoping that if it fails again it’ll be before the 1 year repair warranty is up in December!",2022-11-01 11:01:05

cjbnk9,"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.",2019-07-29 17:24:41

After some months I started to get a lot of attention from the girls (it was not the reason to play but I didn’t complain about it), suddenly all boys wanted a guitar.

nxf72w,"Some MickeyD's are better than others. Depends on who is running each one. For a vast majority of franchises it's nothing more than a money game, but some owners/managers either take pride in their food quality or they understand their clientele well enough to know they'll go somewhere else if your food isnt great. This seems particularly true for small towns where you aren't the only option for dining out. I've noticed that the ones that have multiple locations close together all owned by the same person tend to be particularly shitty 🤷‍♂️. Purely anecdotal of course.

*Just an edit to add that small towns have the advantage of word of mouth, if you live in the town where you own a restaurant you know what people are saying about your restaurant and you know the people saying it.

7n8zoh,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand a *Brave New World*. The themes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of socioeconomic hierarchies most of the alphas and betas will go over a typical gamma’s head. There’s also /u/gumbo_chops's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his motifs- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Aldous Huxley's literature, for instance. The alphas understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these utopian ideals, to realise that they’re not just the most useful- they say something deep about the true usefulness of gammas. As a consequence people who dislike alphas and betas truly ARE ~~idiots~~ gammas- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the intelligence in /u/gumbo_chops’s existential outlook “there would be no one to take the shit jobs,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Huxley's English dystopian novel *Brave New World*. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpleton gammas scratching their heads in confusion as Huxley’s genius wit unfolds itself on their reddit thread. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a *Brave New World* tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only (orgy porgy amirite)- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own alpha IQ (preferably lower - read beta) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

The reason: when I looked at the picture, my brain registered it as a regular walk. So OP's title to me meant that he likes to hop with one foot in the opposite direction of where the steps are. Therefore, it would create something like this:

L  R  H 

Where 

L= left 
R= right 
H= one foot going in the opposite direction.

My hubby and I make great money, so have zero need to feel ""bitter"" about ""not keeping my whole paycheck"". What a strange thing to say.

geu3mi,"There's something called tempeh, you can cook it, fry or serve raw (for example in salad). There's seitan, its texture and taste is very meat like. Tofu can be tasty if prepared right (you can find like a quadrillion recipes on the internet) and it's really easy to prepare - many recipes are basically ""get ingredients, mix them and put tofu in it to marinate, then deep fry"". From veggies nice option is [eggplant](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/deep-fried-eggplant-3645054fried) in crispy batter (type of batter depends on for who it's made - vegan or vegetarian). Eggplant can be also grilled. You can look for vegan options - sausages, vegan ribs,vegan salami/sliced meat etc, more and more are available now and some brands are really good/tasty(at the beginning it tasted like cardboard 🤷‍♀️). You can make dish called [pierogi](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/homemade-pierogi-recipe). Pierogi can be stuffed with anything you want and honestly I can recommend it for anyone and everyone. [Crêpe](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%AApe) is easy to make and also can be stuffed with anything.",2020-05-08 16:59:59

ch31gv,"The same is true for parenting. It's just expected of mums but dads get huge pats on the back just for showing interest in thier children 🤷🏼‍♀️ I know loads of dads who are really involved with their children but society's view of a father or husband doing something completely normal is baffling.

He's not 'helping' with the chores or 'helping' with the kids, he's doing his part as a responsible adult.

ch31gv,"Ugh. Don’t get me started on this bullshit.

The company that collects garbage in my town has two contracts for pickup. One for recycling. One for the garbage. 

Here is the issue though. The company picks up at 3AM. Guess they think no one is awake, so they just dump both the recycling and garbage into one truck. 

It’s was in the fall last year. I started filming them, every week, and posting them on the towns Facebook page, and naturally the residents are pissed that we have to pay (since “the savings” are being passed on to us) for a garbage contract and a recycling contract, since it goes to the same place anyway. 

Back in the spring, had to take construction garbage up to the transfer station, which happens to be the same one our towns pickup company uses. 

You see the trucks come in, dump their load (that’s what she said), and then a front end loader with compacting wheels smashes and flattens it all up, and then loads it into train cars. So I got a video of that and posted it. 

Some people on borough council realized that was an issue, so it was the meeting after Easter, they told everyone “we straightened out the problem with the company” 

The solution? The garbage truck picks up the trash and leaves the recycling, and now they wait till they pick up the garbage, and come back around with the same truck and pick up the recycling. “Different truck guys 😉😉😉” except no, it isn’t. They, I guess, just think people will see them skipping the recycling, and assume someone else will get it. 

Brought the new issue to council, and they told me that there wasn’t an issue anymore, cause the garbage hauler told them it was solved. 

So... I reported them to the attorney general of my state, and the investigation is still ongoing. 

I’m gonna take down big trash! Oh shit, “Vote Johnny 2020! He took down big trash... Out to the trash?”

Ok I’ll work on that",2019-07-24 09:00:51

I decided it would be my partner who would be kidnapped as he was the easiest to steal, leaving me unprotected (I had zero concern for him 😆). Freaked myself out that much I resorted to the above.

Afterwards, she was no longer scared. I had her lead the group to set the pace, and with me behind her, she wasn't going to get trampled or hurt.

I knew he had good intentions, but this is a guy who totaled several cars because he was daydreaming about video games. Anyway, in the end, having the baby was a huge, huge bridge in our relationship where we once had a big gap.

Personally I'd rather put all of my things in the checked bag and fork over the $50.  There's also the issue of someone maybe not flying all the time and being sold a bag that is marketed as a ""carry on"" but they actually dont fit all bins or are actually too large for whatever plane they are traveling on.

lpcxat,"I worked at a summer camp back in 2015, and we had a (maybe similar?) game during our “carnival” night where the campers would try to catch goldfish in their mouth out of a kiddie pool (I was never a fan of the game because so many of the campers would swallow the fish alive, but that’s beside the point). Oftentimes, the campers would keep the goldfish they caught in an empty bottle and take it home with them.

Exactly one week after one such carnival, I was cleaning out the skateboard shed after the campers had all gone back home when I noticed a glass lemonade bottle on the shelf. There was a goldfish inside, barely alive and floating in dirty fish poop water. My friends and I quickly rescued him from the bottle and put him in a large salad bowl, and I retrieved some old goldfish supplies from home to use. I did some research on how to nurse a goldfish back to health, which is how I found out how much work actually goes into caring for goldfish and how long they can live if cared for properly.

After a couple days, he was darting around the large salad bowl we had temporarily put him in, obviously much healthier. We decided to name him Bear Gills because he’s a survivor and lived off his own excrement for a week 😂 he also goes by Feesh.

I kept Feesh for a couple years in a 30 gallon tank and eventually upgraded to a 55 gallon. He eventually settled down with my mom and stepdad, since I don’t have a permanent residence and can’t haul around a 55 gallon tank every time I move. My stepdad is the one that cares for Feesh and he’s grown very fond of him!

I wish I had a picture to show, his scales have developed into an iridescent white shade, it’s so fucking pretty. He looks like an albino goldfish lol.",2021-02-22 07:04:18

See people who are alergic to fur are alergic to all kinds o fur, but in case of cat fur it happens because of the cat saliva (they take showers that way🙂) rather than the fur itself.

One trip to Disney World, I rode four rides to face my fear: Expedition Everest (rollercoaster that goes high and backwards), Tower of Terror (drops you from high up repeatedly), Space Mountain (dark rollercoaster that I really shouldn't have ridden after an all you can eat buffet 🤢), and Aerosmith's Rockin' Rollercoaster (another fast rollercoaster).

I'm still not over my fear, but I'm more willing to put myself in situations that trigger my fear. Baby steps, I guess. (Plus I showed my boys that you shouldn't not do something just because you're afraid. So Dad points?)",2018-07-11 17:39:14

You never know when someone might be struggling with something that you can't see, a kind comment can remind them why they became a teacher in the first place.

As for this situation. It actually turned out pretty good. The kid was mad at me because I had to contact the principal about some concerns and a call home was made. The kid was mad at me for getting him in trouble, decided to write ""Fuck Mr. B"" in a notebook. We had a good talk about how it's ok to be mad but that writing things down where other people might see them is not a very good idea. 

I figured the kid learned a good lesson, so I didn't snitch. 👍",2021-04-17 07:11:21

vlbbz6,Those are the few good managers... 👍,2022-06-26 23:32:31
vlbbz6,When do we finally get to tell the customer off? When does the employee get treated equally to the customer? Just wondering 😀,2022-06-27 00:55:23
vlbbz6,"I had a customer call me a bitch to another coworker and my boss couldn't stop laughing when she heard. She was so cool and we were all so tight, she curated a perfect team and we loved and knew each other like family.

When the woman came back to scream at the coworker some more about me, and threw her 3-year-old against the door for spilling something on a shelf at the front (oh boy... we were a kids' place... that didn't fly), boss was shocked but not that much so. She trusted us implicitly.. also we had cameras in case any moms got really pushy about their lies.

But yeah holy shit, I miss her so much. We felt like peers in that place. She was fiercely protective of us ❤️

-

edit: I just remembered vaguely, lady kept up an email correspondence after this and boss tried to confront her politely and get her side of the story before checking the cams - just in pure shock an adult woman could behave so offensively out of nowhere and wondering if we were possibly exaggerating a tad. 

the woman blew tf up on her. reamed her out over email about the employees shit-talking customers behind their backs and demanding boss' personal phone number and direct lines of contact to corporate so she could show her a piece of her mind. The reason she reported to corporate first was because the woman threatened us so hard she wanted to control the narrative and stem the hailstorm coming in.

she showed us the email chain, in total shock and anger that this grown ass woman could be so wildly vicious at such a nice bunch of folks and her own kid, boss going total mama bear about me and coworkers and thanking us for keeping our cool. 

after laughing/groaning/sighing our asses off in disbelief, she kept saying she was done with her and we don't need that energy around. that was when she banned her and started collecting the footage and statements from us. That was the only person I ever saw with a flat out ban in all my years there.",2022-06-26 21:16:04

vlbbz6,"I only have had one crazy complaint as an assistant manager so far but honestly while the *ahem* ""guest"" was there, I told my girl that she was gonna get a raise because she had to deal with such rude people. 

She knows when I say stuff like this to ham it up, cause I definitely dont have that power lol. 

Loved it when I heard the outraged shriek of ""well I'm never coming here again, lost a sale and I'm gonna call corporate... Etc... Etc...

Funny thing is, I never heard anything from corporate later either. 🤷‍♀️",2022-06-27 02:55:35
vlbbz6,"we did. wrote up an intensely detailed incident report and sent to corporate, who did nothing. I wish we'd reported it to the police but not sure if boss went that far. 

iirc we banned the woman from coming back, though the dad was allowed to come in with the kid since she loved the place and we didn't want to punish her anymore than having an asshole mom would in life. we didn't end up seeing them back in anyway.

this was also right before covid so everything soon went haywire and we ended up closing out doors a few months later 😥",2022-06-26 22:49:56
vlbbz6,bruh there a manger not a fucking therapaist 😂😂😂😂😂😂,2022-06-26 21:56:52
vlbbz6,"I am the security manager at my location and have been for 8 years. I teach others de-escalation tactics as part of my job. I am the one that gets called when all other managers have failed to de-escalate a situation.

If you have worked in customer service for over 10 years then you of all people should know that there are customers who come in looking for an alteraction and won't leave until they have it.

Having to enforce mask mandates throughout COVID has taught me a lot in an area where I thought I had little left to learn. I recommend that you also keep an open mind and recognize that you probably don't know everything about this topic. Have a great day 😉",2022-06-27 01:16:04
