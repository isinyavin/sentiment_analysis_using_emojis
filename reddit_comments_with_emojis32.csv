i1u8qh,I’ll remember this when my mom insists on taking photos with me. 😭,2020-10-27 04:49:56
i1u8qh,"This made me emotional. The last picture I have with my dad is from when I was about 6 years old. I’m in my mid twenties now. He hates pictures of himself so much that he would rip photos and delete home videos if he appeared in them. It’s a serious emotional issue your mother and my father and others seem to have. I still have my dad with me and I think we managed to get one photo together a year ago thanks to a family member who was visiting but I don’t know where it is. Photographs are so important to me because they’re captured memories. From my heart, I am sorry for your loss ❤️ May your memories of your mom always be lovely ones and I hope you laugh and smile much more than cry when you think of her",2020-08-01 17:49:28
i1u8qh,Y’all killin me today.😢,2020-08-01 18:17:50
i1u8qh,"I feel like I could have wrote this about my dad.

He was always the camera man. He loved taking photos of me and my mom. My mom passed away when I was 5 so I have photos and videos of her but only a couple of my dad. I should add that I don't remember much of my mom so those photos and videos are extra special to me. 

He's been gone for 3 years and I'm currently pregnant with my first baby. I'm an only child so I know he'd be so unbelievably excited to know he was going to be a grandpa if he was still here. I don't have many photos to share with my son when he gets older 😔 I'm happy that at least my husband's parents are around and I still have my lively maternal grandmother, but it still sucks my son won't know the other half of his grandparents.",2020-08-01 22:47:29
i1u8qh,Oh no.. I’m gonna cry 😢,2020-08-02 03:31:03
i1u8qh,I always avoid being in pictures. Why did you have to hit me in the feels like that man ? 😭,2020-08-02 07:04:14
i1u8qh,I’m so sorry for your loss. I’m the same way your mom was. I despise pictures. Your post has made me rethink it! Thank you 🙏🏼,2020-08-09 01:27:49
i1u8qh,"Yep I do this too. I take the pics or avoid being in them because of insecurities. My kids tell me this too.  But it is so hard to be so aware of your flaws and then have a keepsake forever of all those flaws.  We always end up saying “this is for the overhead “ when we ever get a photo of me that I just happen to think is ok. Meaning for the “overhead” photos that will be shown at my funeral.   🤨😳
Edit:  I am sorry OP. I wasn’t meaning to sound insensitive, I just understand where your mum was coming from.  May she RIP 🙏🏻",2020-08-19 16:08:06
i1u8qh,"Growing up, I was one of those kids who hated having my picture taken. I would run and hide if a camera was pointed at me and now I really regret it. Now when I look back at my childhood pictures it’s pretty sparse and I wish I would’ve taken more haha. I take waaay too many pictures now after going through that 🤣 

Your post is sooooo true! Thanks 🙏",2020-08-20 01:18:49
i1u8qh,"I definitely will never take this for granted. My mother is 66 years old and she lost her mother when she 5 years old, to this day she has no idea how her mother looks like and it's devasting to her. She's asked family members and not one picture is around. Definitely will ALWAYS take pictures when I can of my mother. 💕",2020-08-24 04:28:09
i1u8qh,"I LOATHE pictures , it infuriates me that my husband takes uglier pics of me when I’m distracted and can’t avoid them. If I had his passwords i would delete 99% of them 😤",2020-08-24 18:48:09

i1u8qh,"This makes me cry because my mom is the same way and she's still here. I have tried telling her what so many others have shared as far as how I feel and she doesn't care 😔 😪 . Also, I haven't been able to speak to my dad in years and he has already survived cancer. But I don't even know what he's like anymore nor do I have any pictures 😔 😕 😢",2020-11-14 04:09:01
i1u8qh,"Oh God that hit home😫😫im the same way and my kids beg and plead with me . Or I make a silly face. Thank you. I dont want that to happen😭😭 so glad you posted this! By the way, your mom is beautiful,  why would she not want pictures??",2020-12-19 08:46:05
i1u8qh,"We recently lost my brother in law in August to suicide 😔.
This post hits home a little too much, my husband's side of the family always said they detest pictures and it was always a funny ""inside joke"" when they (literally) ran away from the camera. Well it wasn't so funny in August when i had to use a shitty blurry picture from a website from one of his old jobs for the memorial cause we couldn't find any others. I couldn't even make it too large because the resolution was such crap. 
So yeah totally agree, luckily my mother-in-law and sister-in-law acknowledged now that we should have more pictures together and stopped running away from the camera...",2020-12-21 13:09:17

i1u8qh,Make sure to have all of those photos saved up in the cloud please ♥,2020-08-01 17:45:43
i1u8qh,"Because of how i personally felt and how we ended up going into an emergency c-section, I don't have the oh so important picture of me and my daughter after I gave birth to her. They wisked her away and I didn't even question it.

I never did get the picture because of the low self-esteem holding me back...but I am going to try to get more pics of us together...

My twin sister committed suicide 4yrs ago and I LOVE our pictures of us together...thanks for reminding us how mummies are seen by their kids❤",2020-08-01 18:22:35
i1u8qh,I always force myself to take photos with my kids and family because of this. I struggle a lot with self image issues. Particularly my crooked teeth. But I still smile big grins for them so they have them when I’m not here. I’m really sorry you didn’t get more to remember her by 💕,2020-08-01 18:27:55

i1u8qh,"As a mom, it’s not that we all don’t like being in pictures.... we’re just usually the only ones who think to take any.  Obviously it sounds like your mom was different. My husband never takes photos when my son and I are playing, even though I tell him he should try to. Anytime my husband and son are playing, I’m taking photos to document the memories. So I don’t know if you’re a male or female, but please remember to take photos of your future spouse/child together ❤️ candids that he/she won’t be aware of are even better than the posed ones!",2020-08-01 18:53:08
i1u8qh,My daughter insists we get a new pic every so often. We did a family pic back in the spring and I'm so glad we did that. I occasionally take a selfie for her or suggest we take a pic. I don't like having my pic taken but I want the family to have them when I'm gone. It's important to them😉,2020-08-01 18:57:25
i1u8qh,"Also if someone is always the one taking pictures, offer to take a couple so they can be in some. My aunt was always the one behind the camera so we were also lacking pictures of her when she passed away.

Sorry for your loss OP 💙",2020-08-01 18:57:33
i1u8qh,I needed this to today. Saw a bad picture of mysef taking during a fun  group activity today and wanted to cringe and undo it. No I don’t. Thank you - and I’m so sorry for your loss. ❤️,2020-08-01 19:11:04
i1u8qh,"I felt uncomfortable in photos after the birth of my son. I felt overweight and just a mess..

 I’m glad we took them anyways. 

1. I was delusional that I thought I was too fat...that’s not what I see in them at all 7 years later 
and 
2. I have never felt so much joy - and you could tell.

Go take the photos.

Also- go do the things with the kids. Put on a suit and jump in the pool. Get on a bike and ride down the block. Don’t let body issues 
 be the reason you miss out on joy.  Do them anyways.

Thanks for your post. It’s a good reminder❤️ my condolences on your loss.",2020-08-01 19:14:44
i1u8qh,"I have very few pictures from when I was a baby or growing up. So I've been taking tons of my kid. I never really thought about it from her side. Thank you for this. I will make sure she has selfies with her Mama as we grow up. 

I am so unbelievably sorry for your loss. Just know that she is always with you and made sure you could remember how you grew up  ♥️",2020-08-01 19:29:18

I don't even want pictures of me.",2020-08-01 19:44:56
i1u8qh,I started using a snapchat filter to take pictures of my mum. She loves them. We even take selfies together now. Before that she hated seeing herself in pictures. It’s so sad to think that she sees herself as ugly and fat and old because I think she’s gorgeous and I love her very much ❤️❤️,2020-08-01 19:46:10
i1u8qh,"Wow, this is me in a nutshell. I don’t believe I’m pretty enough to be in pictures. So I’ve been avoiding having my picture taken, like the plague. 😐",2020-08-01 20:35:34
i1u8qh,"My kids hate being in pictures, so I hardly have any of them past like 9 years old because they’ll literally run and hide from a camera. 😞

I avoid them myself also, though, because I can’t get friends / family to stop posting them online no matter how much I ask.",2020-08-01 20:55:53
i1u8qh,I have two kids and I never allow pics of myself but I’m going to make an effort to take more with them and not just of them. Thank you for the reminder ❤️,2020-08-01 21:51:52
i1u8qh,"I'm so sorry for your loss. May her memory be a blessing. 💛

This is how I feel about my mom. She just turned 70, so I could have her for another 20 years or 20 months. She has a condition that makes half her face either clench up painfully or droop as if she's had a stroke. Over the years she grew harder and harder to get into a picture until finally I just said, ""Listen: someday you're gonna die. Do you want me to have this picture of us together, or do you want me to be sad about how few pictures we took together?"" And she got it. Now she may feel ugly, but she sucks it up and selfies with me, and I have a lot of pictures of us together that I treasure.",2020-08-01 23:42:42

i1u8qh,Our best friend took his own life back in May. He hated taking pictures. My bf and I SCOURED every inch of the internet looking for one of us together and we slowly realized he had never taken one in 7 years of friendship.  We luckily found one taken by an ex girlfriend at a game night a few weeks ago. It’s my most treasured picture now.  I wish we had all had this revelation sooner. ❤️,2020-08-02 07:26:26

i1u8qh,"You’re so right. I remember my mom always wanting to take pictures of me and I used to get annoyed and hated it. But now that I’m 29, I love looking through old pictures, there’s a lot still thankfully and sometimes I wish there were more. I make sure to take lots of pictures of my fiancé now and us together too because these memories will last forever through photos. It’s all we’ve got to remember the past and the great and tough times we go through on the journey of life. Thank you for your post 👍🏻",2020-08-04 01:42:23

i1u8qh,"I saw your post and I’m so grateful that I read it. I’ve been told my whole life I’m attractive but because of some difficult things I went through as a child I have never believed I am. Before I had children, when I was in my 20’s, I would take group pics with friends but they usually had to cajole me into them. I have stayed behind the camera most of my life and particularly since I had my children. I’m in my 40’s now and I haven’t really had a picture taken of me that I haven’t deleted or thrown out since I had my daughter almost 6 years ago. My sons are always begging me to let them take pics of and I really struggle to allow it, most often telling them “later” or “some other time”. Your post really made me see how selfish and ridiculous I have been. I have fleetingly considered from time to time what my children would have as a visual memory of me when I pass, but generally pushed the thoughts from my mind and went back to hiding. When you said how children see their mothers I felt every word of it to be true. My children tell me I’m beautiful often but the only time I really feel it, know it is when they look at me. I can see me through their eyes and then I feel beautiful. I needed to hear your truth for it to become my truth, so thank you. 🦄",2020-08-05 22:40:42

Or making you get your picture taken, so they can post it on Facebook. It would be different if they kept the picture/s to themselves or if I was an adult and didn't see them often.

ifytxk,"I have IP on a consumer product that was hot back in 2013/2014. Amazon totally fucked my company by allowing third party sellers to sell and commingle our SKU’s when we repeatedly told them that NO other company has access to our SKU, and that we would be the only seller of that SKU.

They didn’t give a shit. Shortly thereafter we had people hijacking our listing, and selling the same SKU, but as a third party seller. Didn’t make any sense, but they allowed it to happen. The product itself then got knocked off by so many other sellers on different listings and SKU’s but Amazon would not take responsibility for any products not “sold by amazon”. 

I lost hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to get them to do the right thing. Millions in opportunity costs. Their stance is that they are a marketplace, and I would have to contact each individual seller. Righttttttttttt..

On the Flipside, as a buyer, I do enjoy “free” same day delivery. 🤷🏻‍♂️

ifytxk,"With this cummingled strategy, how sellers are going to get paid? If I am selling on Amazon and my stuff got mixed with everyone else, how am I supposed to get paid at the end of the month or whatever the payment cycle goes... 

Amazon must be doing something to identify each sellers stock as the prices are not the same.

For 1 thing there's a ton of lotions made and it's more watery than a cream. I ordered it online from Walmart like I have done many times in the past without any problems at all. My online Walmart order came in this past Friday 9/4. That JUNK made a funky rash on my hand just from using it ONCE bc it was NOT the name brand I've been using forever! This has NEVER happened before! Since Fri, I've fortunately had Rx strength cortisone in the medicine cabinet to put on it alone with taking Benedryl every 8hrs. Then my sweet husband goes to the actual brick and mortar Walmart and buys ANOTHER brand new tube of Eucerin cream. The outside tubes look exactly the same. It's when I take the products out and compare them that you can see a slightly different color from the one I ordered online! Otherwise you can't tell them apart unless you have the 2 of them side by side to compare them! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 Well there's enough difference in the fake to make my skin break out in a funky rash on the back of my hand! Don't mistake me. I don't blame Eucerin. This is 100% WALMART's fault! Until we stop sitting on our ass doing nothing about it, these giant companies aren't going to be getting better!

I don't think he was ever found but it was not a case in the news, he was missing in the sense of no foul play was suspected but rather he had packed up all his shit and left everyone behind. As a man who NEEDS to do that one day to get away from his family... I understand, but at the same time it seemed this was not the case and he seemingly vanished into thin air.

I'm raising my daughter to think critically and to have common sense and compassion. I let her watch things like South Park, the Simpson's instead of hiding it from her because she'll just sneak around and watch it behind my back. I expose her things that our parents would have been too uptight to explain. I was raised in a very strict household and when I was young I did everything in my power to go behind my parents back and see what they didn't want me to try. I think it's a little uncomfortable to explain adult themes (I'm not talking about anything sexual) at times but kids just want answers. So it's up to us to just talk to them. So far my daughter is well behaved, well spoken, maturing fast mentally, kind and compassionate. Now, I'm not saying let your children curse or talk back or do what they please. Command authority, set your boundaries and makes sure they know the consequences if they overstep those boundaries. This is just how I'm raising my daughter.

ie7u6k,"A month or so back I finally told my parents how I felt about my half-assed, awful homeschool that's kept me tied up way past when I should have graduated. How instead of getting me algebra help like a tutor or something (because my mom could *not* teach it hardly) my mom would rather babysit my oldest sister's kids all day, every weekday for like 5 years straight. And she would always have me do my work by myself because I was older then my two other siblings and thus could ""work on my own."" My mom was trying everything she could to say, ""nuh uh, it wasn't like that!"" and my dad was silent during this entire conversation.

Know what I got for that? Know what I got for telling them the thing that's caused so much anxiety and stress and depression my entire high school life? All I got for that was my dad coming into my room later mad at *me* because I made my mom angry at him because he didn't join in and gang up on me.

It is heartbreaking to know, both as a teacher and as a parent, just how broken our public school system is. (Is it any better in private schools? I don’t know; I was always in public school.) I know so many people who go into to teaching for the love of it, and end up leaving because the circumstances are just so shitty...now more than ever. You’re being asked to choose between your livelihood or your life, and it’s not right or fair. To say nothing of the challenges of actually educating kids remotely! There are so many changes that need to happen, not just in our schools, but as a society. When we, as a society, value lifting up billionaires and suppressing education, something is very very wrong! My kids are fortunate to have a mother who is experienced and able to homeschool them right now. I’ve even had friends ask me if I would consider teaching their kids as well, so they don’t have to go back to the germ-infested schools right now.

#Made from **💯% REAL FRUIT JUICE**

FYI and then the 99% / 1% is actually a breakdown of the 0.1%",2020-05-07 20:21:48
gf9q42,"Very true. My ex in laws had a smallish family farm (probably 2-3 dozen cows, a lot more sheep, lots of chickens). Their animals were taken care of very, very well. I know because I helped with the work there too. The animals all had free range of very large pastures that I could see part of from the kitchen window lol. 

They actually did raise them on organic foods, didn’t use pesticides on the pastures or in the garden areas. Someone went through the fields multiple times every day checking on the animals. An animal only got medicine if it was sick. Didn’t happen often. 

They’d considered going through the process that would let them label what they sold “organic“ but saw how expensive it would have been to do so and the bureaucracy involved and decided that it wouldn’t be worth it. But they did still sell the meat for more than you’d pay at the grocery store.

Like I said, it was a small farm. They mostly sold meat and eggs to local people and at the farmers market lol. People were welcome to drop by anytime if they wanted to see how it ran or whatever. Of course everyone in the family got their meat from them. The cows were actually named because it was easier and less confusing to say something like ”Dottie (instead of #12473) is acting like she is gonna calve really soon, so be sure to keep a close eye on her.” That part made me sad, especially because sometimes I watched them give birth to the ones who eventually became steaks :( 

Anyway, my ex in-laws always demanded every single part from each animal from the butcher. He didn’t like that cause he could’ve made money by selling it himself. They’d use some bones to make broth, gave some to their working dogs, used the fat to make lard that replaced crisco, sold the skins to leather companies, etc.

This turned into a long post. My real points are—

1. Animals are not raised for leather. Every part of an animal is usually used in some way.

2. If someone feels bad for eating animal products but still can’t manage to stop eating meat, they should start buying it from a relatively small farm that they can visit in person. People who run small farms almost always take very good care of their animals. It might not always, or even usually, be because they actually care about the animals. But at the end of the day, selling good meat is how they pay their bills 🤷🏻‍♀️

wonderful.  My wife is also a teacher and shares a similar policy of positive reinforcements for good behaviour and good efforts. 
My daughter has been extremely fortunate growing up as we have had a live in housekeeper for the majority of her life (it’s not as la-di-da as it sounds, it’s common in the Philippines where we lived).  She isn’t spoilt per-se but has grown accustomed to someone picking up after her.  I have recently started paying her to do chores to teach her responsibility and how to save and budget and general finances as being 12 money is an abstraction to her as everything she needs is paid for.  I believe in reward for good behaviour rather than nagging the bejesus out of her to do what she is asked.  My wife tells me (we are separated by pandemic border closures) she is doing everything that’s expected of her without asking.

If I asked everyone to clean up the classroom, I often did it with them too to show that *everyone* is supposed to help. I'd use please and thank you and if I got something wrong, I'd apologize and fix my mistake if I could.

The other half is whatever they want as long as it isn't harmful, even if I don't think it's a wise use of money. They don't often complain but will always do them after we established no chore means no money. I also fill their charts for karate and they earn self discipline stripes. 

Of course no one wants to do the right thing without reward and kids don't really get the long game yet. We do say thank you, too. 😊",2020-07-05 07:39:41

hldrfa,"Late reply: I had a fucked-up, traumatic childhood. My mom (undiagnosed bipolar & PTSD) and I (same plus a bunch of other stuff) were horrible to each other. I was fully convinced she hated me. Our relationship was rocky at best from the time I was 6 till adulthood--when she did a lot of reflecting and offered a sincere apology for all she did to me, and I was able to do the same. That empowered me to apologize to my younger siblings I'd abused when we were little and I was lashing out nonstop from trauma. 

If it weren't for sincere apologies and committing to be better to each other, my family's relationships would not be what they are today: supportive, active, and stable.

So yeah, this is top-notch advice. 💜",2020-08-03 03:20:18

hldrfa,"I’m so sorry you had to go through that. :( I too had to establish no contact with my family and am blamed by all of them for the fracture. It hurts worst from the siblings (specifically my twin, ouch) that saw it all over the years but still somehow don’t recognize the abuse and gaslighting. 

Years of therapy helped me see that I am at my healthiest without them. I have a box of their manipulative letters that I refer back to periodically when I’m feeling low and remind myself why it’s healthiest this way. Reconnecting with them would only open me up to more abuse  and disappointment, and it wouldn’t fill the void of the acceptance and healthy family dynamic I wish we could have. Friends are the family I choose, but it’s not always easy. Stay strong, and you’re not alone! 💜",2020-07-10 20:24:16

Little by little my ""friends"" (8+ years) bailed on me and called me negative, I lost the last two a few months back and my childhood friend seems to be planning on leaving too (not like I even tell her much anyways, but yeah).

Mid-2019, depressed and miserable, went to a cooking course in hopes to meet people and because I love cooking. Shit course and didn't really meet many people, except this guy, X. 

X and I hit it off, we hang out after the course and such, guys solid. Months pass and I just...cut him off as I'm getting worse, but throughout this he STILL messaged me to check on me, until one point he didn't. 

A year or so passes, maybe less, I hit him up again and guy acts like time hadn't passed. I was a bit on/off for a bit but after venting and being honest and him LISTENING TO MY NEEDS, plus being happy I invite him over for homecooked meals and make him desserts, he's been so supportive and sweet, I feel grateful.

I told him I didn't understand why, we barely knew each other, and he just said I seemed really cool and he enjoyed spending time with me, and you don't bail on friends when they're struggling.

kkhm94,"Eta: i am experiencing extreme brain fog so i apologize if this came out confusing

Yes!!! As a person with chronic illnesses and depression it isn't because i dont care about person x, its that i get into depression and chronic illnesses are often invisible...so either folks get tired of making special allowances for you or down by your YOUR health issues.  It gets really easy to start cutting yourself off until 1 day is a week and that week is a year. Then the litany of anxiety thoughts start.

 if you are the person who starts off calls with ""omg where were you... WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED ME... you're a shitty friend... ""  YOU are proving that you are not a safe person in a time of crisis. I 100% of the time will never call even family who do this... and i drop ""friends"" who do this because it shows you don't care about the other persons wellbeing... just the things they can emotionally or otherwise take from them. 

If you really do care, NEVER say these stupid things. ""Hey, it's been a while, are you ok?"" Totally fine. ""We've been worried about you"" etc are fine. 

I love my grandma to pieces but i haven't called in a year bc the first thing I'll hear is a critism... and she's one of the most beloved people in my life. 

Never assume malice if somebody drops off the radar...its probably depression or a personal issue. 

IF you can handle other people's pain, be honest and talk to your friends who have health issues who have tried to talk with you.  Sometimes we just need a friend to acknowledge we are suffering and just that supportive environment to take our masks off is literally life saving. If you can't, do not pretend you can. This will lead to resentment of your friend and you will feel like they are always complaining.

j3od6j,"Except that for some of us it's just not possible, and trying to force ourselves through what it would take to achieve those arbitrary standards of success does so much harm for so very little good. 

I graduated salutatorian and got into a very good college but since I began to have symptoms of chronic illness at 14, primarily constant migraines, vivid nightmares, and difficulty keeping a consistent sleep schedule -- which made waking up for school in the morning nigh impossible -- I ended up with my mother shaking me awake, jerking me out of bed, tipping my mattress over, using a spray bottle on my face, or other wretched wretched tactics for about 2 hours every morning of every day of the week of high school. No lie. Her alarm went off at 5:15 every goddamn day to ""start on me."" I'm a pretty extreme example of where this mentality can lead, ~because you have to give your all to get the best grades to go to the best college to get the best job or your life is fucked~. But truly? *Because* of that vehemence, my life is fucked. And it didn't have to be that way.

If I'd been allowed to do things reasonably -- and actually take time to care for my body and mind, and address my health problems rather than degrade my function and wellbeing ever further trying to meet demands that weren't worth tearing myself to pieces for -- I'd have eaten and slept enough and started at community college, at whatever pace I could safely maintain. Where is the problem with that? Is that really too much to ask? Will you actually continue to spit on the idea that making sure you're physically and mentally well is important, and as long as your basic needs are met (money-wise /and/ biology-wise), it's enough?

Instead, under an outlook just like yours, I'm exhausted and traumatized as fuck, my grades declined year by year till I barely scrubbed out passing grades for my degree, after graduation I managed to work 6 months on a research project before having to drop out for health reasons, and while I'm managing my symptoms ever better, I'm still unable to work, financially unstable, and utterly terrified over how I'm gonna stay housed and fed. Plus my parents shelled out $80,000 towards their dreams for me and aren't likely to see the return on investment they expected.

You seem to be arguing that it's irresponsible to allow room for people to have actual human needs that conflict with grade school demands because otherwise they won't be able to provide for themselves. Hi, yes, hello 👋🏻 case in point that doing things well enough without wrecking oneself can bring about a vastly more stable and healthier outcome than chasing perfection to one's own incredibly severe detriment and a giant net loss. 

The friends I've kept up with who were ~average~ students are generally employed and continuing to develop their lives and careers and relationships. I got excellent grades (until I didn't) and applied myself completely (until I couldn't) and am stuck doing damage control for years of extreme sleep deprivation and abuse. 

By now you should know which I consider the smarter route.

Please. No one fucking do that to your kids.",2020-10-15 04:59:56
uvycv7,"I worked at a bar that paid $6/hour (waitress wage), but the average tips meant it was advertised as almost $15 an hour. Pretty great, right?        
There were 4 of us behind the bar for a college night. After we paid everyone out and split tips, we were all gonna walk home with about $60 each, $35 on the paycheck before taxes.    
But the register was $80 off. The owner made us split the amount missing in the register to pay back for losses, so $20 each. He made close to $1k in sales that night. I had never heard of such a weird practice, and I knew that businesses generally account for losses so that it’s not on the employees unless they’re caught stealing. Mistakes happen, and he never trained anyone to count money correctly there. But all of my seniors did paid without fuss, so I did too.      
So for 7 hours of practically running back and forth to make drinks, dealing with rude clients, AND no break (7 hr shifts are common so you don’t legally get a break) - my gross income was $95 which isn’t bad for being in school. But after all the tax math is done, and because we had to report our tips as well (the amount BEFORE we “paid him back”) - my net income was about $55. So the job advertised as “after tips it’s almost $15/hour!” And the reality was after tips I made barely over $7 an hour. That type of night was significantly more common than being able to leave without “paying the register.”

For example did you know they can't drug test you for an on site accident without a reasonable suspicion that drug use contributed to said accident? And it actually violates federal law for them to forbid you from discussing your wages with your coworkers. And they damn sure can't cut your hours or anything for reporting unsafe practices or informing your coworkers of their rights!

So yea... most people aren't paid the official minimum but most hosts, bussers, food runners, S/A's, etc are all paid ""minimum wage"" ie. Non livable wage it sucks that that's what ""minimum wage"" has been defined as now a days but it's true.  That's the new definition. The thing you read that said 2 percent is probably based on the $7.50 minimum wage.... seeing at I just paid 80 dollars for a tank of regular Gas in a hyundai sonata i think it's safe to say that that's not minimum, that's outrageous and should be illigal.

I've given full length SPEECHES (in my workplace) on anxiety and its effects, using my own personal experiences, and am STILL told that I'm ""too confident"" and ""comfortable / relaxed"" to be anxious or insecure or anything. I'm still regarded as the go-to person when a problem crops up, and I'm still leaned on heavily when someone is in emotional need; no one checks up on me because I'm just so darned DEPENDABLE. All of that is great, but it would be really nice if the people in my life actually HEARD me when I told them things, too 😅",2020-06-03 15:52:27

You're describing an opposite of a person with social anxiety and saying they can have social anxiety. 🤦🏻‍♂️ I have never seen an extroverted ""performer"" with social anxiety lol.

gvr62l,"I went through this a lot in my 20's, then regressed into a small anxious man by 30 because of things people would say to me. Just now at 33 I'm starting to get my confidence back & work with my anxiety.

My friends thought I had my shit together because I had a great sales career at 23, kept my place nice, and my male friends at the time would call me ""mr. Model"" in a jealous mean way because they considered I was a decent looking guy. They would go out of their way to belittle me in front of women I was interested in too, and I believed them (I am no longer friends with these type of people).

I hated my job, hated myself, and was always insecure about my looks. Funny how people see one thing, when internally you feel so different.

Fast forward to now though - I got a mentor/life coach, and things are changing in such an amazingly positive way. 20 years of therapy in 1 month. 2 more to go. Cannot wait to see the impact it has on my life 🙏

gvr62l,"I work with tech leads every day! I hear you. You have to be always remembering that everyone is dealing with something, and picking your words carefully. I find the best way to reduce anxiety is, as a leader, to foster an environment everyone would want to be in. That to me means trying to ensure people on my team know it’s a safe space to share you feelings, and that they are taught empathy, understanding, dealing with their insecurities, and acknowledging when others do well, to name a few. It’s not only my responsibility to be caring toward them, they need to care about each other as well. I essentially aim to love every individual on my team as a great human and to always fight in their corner. I ask folks to read the 7 habits of highly successful people, or how to win and make friends. What fantastic resources about being good to others around us!

Nowadays after meetings I also breathe a big sigh of relief when they’re done. It’s hard to maintain others’ morale. One day I’ll be better about that 😄 it’s all about being in the right headspace!",2020-06-03 21:23:46

o6lscq,"Try buying online through places like TrueCar etc.  They'll find dealerships that are desperate to sell or are overstocked, and you'll get a nice discount.

I bought through them 6 years ago.  Dealership had $5000 off sticker for new vehicles, $3500 discount through TrueCar, $600 extra discount for being an Amex card owner.  So I got a $40,000 truck for $31,900; basically a 20% discount.

I asked if a friend of a friend I got referred to (who was the sales manager of a non-corporate dealership) if he could match it and he told me that they were likely overstocked or something because they'd be taking a bath at that price and that it was being sold below dealer cost.

Never intended to buy new cause everyone always says dont but the next closest option I could find anywhere, price wise, after weeks of searching, was a 3 year old version of the same truck with 50k miles and it was only $1500 less.  Screw that.

Crazily enough, due to the recent demand for used vehicles spiking, that 6 year old Toyota Tundra is worth $33,000 in current condition according to KBB which means I could actually sell it now for a profit 🤣.  Crazy.

t9ikh8,"Met a chronic liar in high school who had a HUGE crush on me (""where's my hug?"" Kind of guy). His ice-breaker to me and my friend was telling us about how he once was proclaimed legally dead for a few seconds. Of course we were like ""Holy shit dude, that's crazy!"" and engaging with him, but then every time we talked he would have ANOTHER crazy story. We caught on pretty quick he was lying about everything he said, and started giving pretty deadpan ""uh-huh""'s to him hoping he would get the hint, but he never did. 

My friend finally snapped at him one day when we were talking about hair colors and she mentioned how she would totally dye her whole head rainbow if it wasn't so expensive. Creepy guy (leering over us clearly ignoring him) chimed in with ""I could pay for that!"" 

We both roll our eyes as he continues,
 ""My family is super rich, we have a mansion in Japan with tons of servants and everything.""

My friend turned around and said, ""Yeah? Why don't you pay for it then."" 

He said ""I will!""

""Okay, give me the money then, I'll go dye my hair.""

""Well I don't have it on me right now, I'd have to withdraw it.""

""Alright then, bring it tomorrow.""

""I will!""

The next day, however, wouldn't you believe it! His family mansion was robbed and they had to declare bankruptcy, so now he's super poor :(

""I'm sure we'll get out of it quick though, but I can't pay for your hair I'm so sorry 😔""

We either found a way to entirely avoid him or our schedules changed because I think that was the last time we ever talked to him. He had to have had some sort of mental disorder to lie the way he did even when people called him out on it. If he hadn't been so insistent on pushing my boundaries when it came to affection I probably would have been patient with him, but he made me super uncomfortable. Literally body blocked me from shit until I hugged him and dude was HUGE. Hope he ended up getting help with whatever was making him lie so much.",2022-03-08 22:48:50
t9ikh8,"I have a buddy that’s been chronically lying since we were kids. One day I ran into his older sister in college and we started talking about him. I asked her about certain things that my friend had stated he was doing / happening to him (good things). She looked at me like if I was talking about someone else and then she said “oooooh he’s been telling you that? 🙄he’s always been such a chronic liar.”

She completely exposed him in that instant and everything all of a sudden made sense. There had been signs and All the countless stories he told had always stood out abit but I had never really thought too much about it.

I’m still close with him but Ever since this talk with his sister, I cringe every time my friend tells his “unbelievable” and “too good so be true” stories that happen to him weekly.",2022-03-08 23:38:32

Me and all of our friends knew that he always lied about stuff and most of us just atopped caring at some point.

One of the weirdest things was for example, that he told everybody, that one of his oldest friends was his brother. He just made that up! Most people understood very quick, that it was not true and when he inteoduced him as his brother somewhere, people where like ""Oh you mean you are like BROS or something?"" and he would always be like ""No no, we ARE brothers. We only have different mothers.""

Then one day his GF found out at a family dinner, she said sth about his ""Brother"" and his parents were like ""That man is not his brother, they are just childhood friends"". The crazy thing is, he managed to keep her as GF by telling her a bunch of other BS 😅

t9ikh8,"I'm gonna be totally honest here. I have no qualms fudging the truth to save my own ass. Why am I late? There was an accident on the highway, I totally didn't oversleep. Why haven't I done XYZ? Because of this thing that's totally out of my control and not because I'm a fucking mess who has a terrible sense of time.

In saying this though, there are a couple things I think are important to recognize. The first being that I genuinely have a problem with time management, deadlines, etc. You could say I'm immature, I like to say it's because of my adhd. The point here is that I recognize I have a problem and I *try* to improve. I don't enjoy having to make up stupid reasons for why I'm late, but I'd rather that then other consequences.

Second, I never lie if it effects anyone else. The above examples are small in the grand scheme of things, but don't have an effect on others. If something I did effected someone else, I suck it the fuck up and take responsibility. For example, I missed a deadline for something at work. It was because of a genuine misunderstanding but it meant that someone else would feel the consequences. I could have done the same thing I do when I'm late, say it was a supply or equipment issue or whatever. Instead, I owned up to it and also went to the other party and said ""hey, I fucked up and I apologize."" I then put in extra time to get it done faster than I would have initially because it was my responsibility to get it done.

I'm saying this just as a differing view point. If you consider me a ""liar"" then that's okay, but I don't think of myself that way. Personally, I've seen so many people get fucked up for being truthful about innocent mistakes and I don't want that to happen to me. At the same time, I think it's important to own up to the actions that affect those around you. 🤷 That's my long winded response. Take it as you will. Have a good day!",2022-03-08 20:36:07

g1r4kb,"This is very interesting. I’m not usually looking to save snails, but if I ever do, I’ll keep this in mind!
I’ve worked at community gardens, and we were usually trying to get rid of snails (they were common and troublesome pests). Usually we would just step on them (sorry! 😬) but another method I heard about was putting cups of beer in the garden. Apparently the snails try to drink the beer, and they drown. (Personally, I never tried it.)

What is your opinion on killing snails to save a garden? Are some methods more humane?

Edited to say that I’m less concerned about being humane in this case than environmentally sustainable, just because I highly doubt there’s a “nice” way to kill legions of snails...it’s not like I can euthanize them. I mean, I don’t want to be unnecessarily cruel or anything, but you have to make these tough decisions sometimes! I think if I ever have my own garden, I’m gonna use chickens to help me keep creepy crawly pests in check.",2020-04-18 18:35:07

hebc6e,"Yes! As they say, don’t judge a book by its cover??
I used to think I was broken, there was an issue; problem with me because I just couldn’t look at people face to face long enough or would focus on something else to maintain my attention.
I was awkward around whatever friends I had, constantly given negative feedback at work for my body language because people felt that “I wasn’t interested or looked bored”...no.
My ability to be around people in certain situations just made me acclimatise in very different ways. I turned to alcohol, prescription pills (I was in & out of hospital at the time) to help “deal” with “my brokenness”.
I started seeing someone again who helped me realise that I’m not what I think I am; I’m just different to everyone else. I don’t know what Person X is going through, Person F, etc.
So I started working on my communication & transparency skills.
Sometimes I still fall into crippling social anxiety, but I know who I am and have a support network (professional/ personal) to pick me up when I need it.
I know it’s not the same for everyone with what I’ve just rambled on about, but for context I have just finished 18 months of treatment for PTSD, Depression, Social Anxiety (not wanting to be out in public, take transport) due to a fairly straightforward car accident.
It reminded me of what it was like to be treated as someone “different”, and it hurts and cuts so deeply.

My conversations become much more stop and go when I'm trying to make eye contact, and I'll often look away if I need to take a moment to think about what to say next, unfortunately, some people who dont know me very well interpret this behavior as me trying to think of a lie or excuse 😕",2020-06-23 14:34:12

hxyk34,"This is soo true! The first time my sister and I moved out, we rented an old apartment that hadn’t been cared for... one of the faucets quite literally fell off when we tried to use it and water was going EVERYWHERE! 

Thankfully we had noticed the main water shut off and were able clear everything up. 

My mother has never received such a frantic phone call in all her life 😂",2020-07-26 09:47:31
hxyk34,"I lived in an old cottage for 6 months as a renter.

Nobody knew where the water valve (or ""stop-cock"" as we call it in Britain. Seriously.) was.

The property was old, and used to have an outdoors toilet. The toilet was long gone, but a water mains was still out there protruding above ground.

During winter, the cap on the mains broke (probably froze? We don't know. It was a cold winter.)

We tried everything to shut the pipe off. Landlord didn't know, grounds owner didn't know, water board didn't know - absolute mystery.

Went out into the street and started lifting water manholes up and shutting random valves in hope it killed it - no dice.

Water pissed out of this pipe for weeks. Garden was completely flooded.

Eventually, plumbers managed to get hold of some specialist pipe-freezing apparatus. They completely wrapped the top of the pipe in self-amalgamating tape (we'd done it before, slowed the flow, but failed after a day or two) which slowed the flow to a bare trickle, stuck a jacket around the pipe, dumped a can of refrigerant into the jacket which totally froze the pipe - enough for them to quickly hack off the old end and replace it with a new end cap and cover the whole pipe in insulation.

We moved out about a month later (LL wanted the property back, needed a lot of work 🤷‍♂️).

Love the place I'm in now, and I know where the stopcock is!",2020-07-26 10:26:34
hxyk34,"If your main shutoff is the old type which requires a ""water key"", install a hand turn shutoff. If you have to shut off your water to do plumbing supply work, cut power to your water heater. Draining down the water can cause the heat elements to be exposed and they will pop, requiring replacement. Restore power to the water heater, only after turning the water back on. If you don't have a pressure regulator, have one installed. Unregulated water pressure can wreak havoc on your plumbing and fixtures, including washing machine and dishwasher. After plumbing work, turn on an an outdoor water spigot before turning the water back on. This will help wash the trash from your lines. It's also a good idea to remove your water savers, as trash will clog them. Reinstall them after running the water in your sinks. If you have the rubber type supply lines, replace them with braided stainless steel type. This is extremely important! If I think of anything else I will add to this comment. ☮️",2020-07-26 11:00:05

Which was their choice to transfer apartments and do it THAT day (they had other days available). And NOTHING was packed when my boyfriend got there Thursday AM to help while I worked. The wife of the ""friends"" is a fucking bitch. The worst human ever, seriously. And all she did the entire time is sit on the couch and bitch at how her husband and my boyfriend were moving things, and in what order, etc. I will never help anyone move again 😂",2020-06-17 02:06:46

• ALWAYS have water available for helpers. 💦 

• Pizza and beer is traditional, but make certain you have some food/drink to thank your friends/family that helped. 🍕🍺

She didn't pack anything. She figured she didn't need to as it wasn't far. She didn't even carry much.

Never again.

When I split from my husband, I got a man and van to help. His face when he walked in was a picture because it looked like nothing was packed. It improved greatly when I pointed to the neatly packed boxes and furniture piled in the living room and said 'this is what we're taking, everything else is staying'.

A nurse came in later and said “it’s okay to ask for a second opinion.” It was a small hospital so we couldn’t get a second opinion til the next day...he said the same thing. Another nurse also said “get another opinion.” We asked for a transfer to the nearest children’s hospital which was 2 hours away.

She had infant botulism. She was about to die.

Fortunately she was immediately put on a bipap for breathing and an NG tube for food... they figured it out 3 days later. Once they treated her for it, it took almost 2 months for her to recover, but she did so, fully, with no lasting effects.

i5p1oe,"To become an RN, all you need to do is take a couple pre-req classes, maybe take a short entrance exam and graduate with an associates from a community college and take the NCLEX. 

Medical doctors have to do 4 years of undergrad plus take the MCAT which is a difficult 7 hour entrance exam for medical school and people spend months studying full time for, then spend 4 years in medical school while taking multiple board exams through out medical school, and then most students go on to do 4 years of residency (15,000+ hours of clinical training) 

So yeah, enough feedback from the doctor for nurse to know is not enough for a nurse to determine whether the doctor is or is not making the best decision for a patient. 

And for the nurses that are offended by these comments, I hate to tell you, just because you are offended doesn’t make my statements any less true. I am sure nurses have said doctors asses all the time which doctors appreciate but “ 🗣@nurses LEARN TO STAY IN YOUR LANE”",2020-08-08 14:12:44

secondly, what you’re failing to understand is that the foreign foods we eat in the UK are fusions, just like ‘tex mex’. the indian and chinese food we have here does not resemble what people eat in india or china either - the chicken tikka masala was actually invented in the UK, for example. dishes such as lasagne, pasta and spaghetti bolognese are staples in most british homes, and are very different to what you’d find in italy, i suppose if we wanted to imagine we were special we’d call it ‘britalian food’ 🙄",2020-03-04 16:28:49
g02a50,"Guys I'm reading all the comments, I'm very glad I could help with an article I just casually found while Googling stuff about my dog.

I'm also sorry for all of you who lost your pet after an episode like this. I know how heavy it is to lose our buddies, cats, dogs, rabbits, snakes, any animal!
We can try and give them the healthiest life we can, give them never ending love and make each day they are with us count but sometimes mother nature just works in mysterious ways and we can't prevent everything from happening (and this goes for everyone, not just pets) so please don't blame yourselves.

I'm more than 100% sure they have been happy to spend their lives, even if sometimes too short, with you and that they're waiting for you on the other side of the bridge.

Get them to the vet for regular checkups and don't forget to give them a big kiss on their little (or big) foreheads whenever you can.

A big big hug from my big crew and I to you and all your best friends. (maybe drop a pic? I can't ever get enough of animals)

Good :) I glad everything is ok with your wife. Yes, it happens a lot, there are many reasons for that. The stress of the flight, the pressure in the cabin, the sudden change in altitude, and of course motion sickness during turbulence. By the way, if you feel sick, of course you need to call the FA, but there is also a very effective way to quickly calm down and suppress the gag reflex. Its diaphragmatic breathing.

hsw3w3,Driving home from the hospital with your newborn baby. 😬,2020-07-17 22:37:54
hsw3w3,My husband and I differ so greatly in this way. I always try to give other drivers the benefit of the doubt (it’s just better for me bc I don’t like getting angry 🙃). Maybe someone just had a c-section. Maybe they have a full crockpot. Maybe they have a 4 tier wedding cake. Expensive machinery. Hubs usually just assumes someone is being a jerk lol. 🤷🏼‍♀️,2020-07-17 20:25:14
hsw3w3,"If also like to add that, in the end, it's important to remember that you have no idea why that person is being so cautious either...

     In 97 I hydroplaned and the truck that I was driving headed to a grass field where it proceeded to roll... Leaving 7 huge divots I can only assume it made 8 rolls. Due to a real bad brain injury I wound up in the ICU then a brain injury unit, all told spending 39 days in 2 different hospitals.
     Due to the brain injury I didn't remember my accident & barely remembered my hospital stay. When I finally got behind a steering wheel again much later I was consumed by overwhelming anxiety even though I couldn't remember anything. Had I tried to keep up with everyone else on the road I probably would have ended up in another bad accident, only this time I would have included other motorists/cars in said accident..

Worst experience was trying to leave distance on the freeway & getting cut off, only for everyone to suddenly slow to a crawl.

It makes me feel worse to have people pretend to care about me on my birthday, and forget about me the rest of the year.

jfn6pc,"On my birthday I was raped and had my virginity taken from me. So I don't like to celebrate because I don't feel like it's a day worth celebrating. I tell people and get mad when they do, but I'm constantly told, put yourself in their shoes, they're trying to do something nice for you. Maybe they should put themselves in my shoes or someone else's and respect the fact that they don't want to celebrate. 🤷🏽‍♀️",2020-10-22 07:55:27
jfn6pc,"Also, just don’t try to force a day to be what you think is “special”.  Holidays and events might be a trigger for someone who grew up in an abusive household.

I made the mistake of trying to make Xmas special for my ex who told me he doesn’t like Xmas.  Fun fact, you might buy someone the coolest presents and cook the nicest meals but it won’t override the memories of abuse and neglect they have and might trigger a bigger episode of PTSD. 🙁

kcknln,"> The much larger puzzle is how do we all deal with a future where there are considerably more humans than there are jobs that require them.

I see four options:

1. Post scarcity socialist utopia a la Star Trek
2. Mass culling of poor people by the elites; solves overpopulation and climate change as well as poverty! 😛
3. Revolt where the poor people rise up and kill all the rich people and take all their stuff, then some of them become rich and the cycle repeats itself ad infinitum
4. Unemployment reaches 51% and unemployed people try to vote in politicians who will enact option 1 but they instead enact option 2 or do nothing which leads to option 3.

I see option 4 leading to option 2 being the most likely path... the government isn't going to do anything unless their hand is forced, and they won't do what we actually want because the billionaires control them...",2020-12-14 16:27:46

igbdmj,"My dad adopted a retired German Shepherd but she suffered from trauma and had a drooping ear. Everything seemed to scare her at first and it took Mocha nearly a year to understand that she had a new home and family. She escaped several times to find her previous handler so my dad had to install grates under our fencing so she couldn’t dig a hole underneath. 

Realizing she might be too much for us to handle, my dad asked if we wanted to give her up. Naturally we said no because we were kids and wanted a dog so bad. Though she had problems adjusting to civilian life, she developed a strong bond with my younger brother and followed him everywhere. 

She also slept at the foot of his bed every night. Even when I wanted her to sleep with me, she would wait until I fell asleep then return to my brother’s room. At first I was jealous but my brother suffered from asthma so at the first sign of an attack she would bark to alert everyone. Thanks to her, my dad was able to rush my brother to the hospital several times when he had severe attacks his inhaler couldn’t remedy. 

She also fought off a coyote that managed to climb a fence and get to my dad’s homing pigeons. Mocha figured out how to push open a window and knock out the screen. Though she injured her paw during process, her strong sense of duty caused her to fight the intruder and scare off another coyote. Fortunately she survived and ended up living to the ripe old age of twelve.

igbdmj,"Eh honestly in most cases, your insurance company is first going to have someone do some recon like in any other suspicious claim. Say the dog is a pit, but your vet listed them as a boxer for you. Someone in special investigations might check your Facebook, maybe ask a neighbor, see if you tell people your dog is a pit. That's how a lot of liars get busted in any kind of claim. If you're saying the dog is a boxer but you have a bumper sticker that says ""I ❤ my pit"" and you posted a Facebook photo of you and the dog captioned ""Hanging with my baby #fuckbreedbans #pitbullmom"", the case is shut right there. Claim denied.

If that turns up nothing, theyll maybe ask a vet besides your own to weigh in as a neutral third party. Even if they did resort to ordering a doggy DNA test, its likely that wouldn't hold in court since the results can vary by the company used, and theyre no where near as regulated and accurate as human DNA testing. So it's a wasted effort on their part if you're willing to fight, and they likely wouldn't go that far unless you have sky high coverage and are sure to lose your case/cost them a lot. Cause keep in mind, even if the victim of the attack sues you for a million dollars, if you only bought $100k of coverage then your insurance is only on the hook for $100k. 

Ultimately, a dog that attacks someone is going to be put down by court order regardless of breed (in most cases). Its more likely they'll try to settle out of court for as little as possible and then dump you as a client. At a certain point, its not worth the bad press and the investment to argue with you. 

TLDR: If you're gonna lie, just be good at it. They'll only put so much effort in to arguing with you.",2020-08-26 02:26:40

Stay strong, my friends ❤️",2020-05-01 02:55:14

gb56tf,That's crazy but why is mine getting worse for the past 4 years 🤣,2020-05-01 06:44:54
gb56tf,"The last few years I noticed my major depression has been more manageable. My late teens and early 20’s almost let my depression kill me, but the last few years I’ve felt like I can cope much better. I’m also over my party days, so I’m not drinking or using anything that will defeat the purpose of taking my anti-depressants and anti-anxiety mess. Just overall making better decisions and dealing better. It brings a lot of hope to me and I encourage anyone suffering with depression in their younger years to look forward to the light at the end of the tunnel. It won’t be perfect, but you’ll be ok, you’ll make better choices and have healthier relationships if you stay in track with treatment and stay off depressants/drugs! ♥️",2020-05-01 06:46:51
gb56tf,"Most definitely true. At some point in my adulthood when things were at their worst and my mental health hit rock bottom, things improved. When I admitted to having a problem and getting on medication for it. 

Not from pretending things will be better because they magically go away with age. 🤣",2020-05-01 11:26:26

gb56tf,"Everyone finds relief in different ways, at different times. One of the reasons I found so much encouragement was that when I was a teenager I thought that if my issues ever went away, it would be when I was MUCH older. But in only about 10 years it started the get better. There are lots of people who do struggle with these issues for a long time, but there are also lots of teens who self harm or take their lives assuming it will never improve when it actually might get better a LOT sooner than they think. Like I said, I do still struggle from time to time, and still have mild anxiety, but it’s far better than it was. You’re welcome to judge my story, but I posted for this just to potentially give some hope to others who think they may never feel better 🙂",2020-04-30 22:45:40
gb56tf,"That line “a lot of people will consider that a failure and just stop all together”. Is what hit the hardest. I go straight in to thinking I’m just awful and might as well give up. Thank you for writing this all out, I appreciate your advice. I’ve started making little lists of just things I need to do and sort of make a big deal of when I accomplish stuff.

All you feel is a string and you have to reeeally reach for it to even feel it, like... actually putting your entire hand in there, lmfao. They insert it past your cervix and most gynos have done it hundreds of times so there's not much that can go wrong. 

I am having mine replaced in a couple weeks tho which is a scary thought 😣 It does hurt when it goes in. But IMO its all worth it for literally not worrying about birth control for 5-10 years, and also the fact that it doesn't upset your hormones as much as some other options.

He, on the other hand, has never said a negative word to them about their mother. It's so sad because to this day (they are all adults now) they have such a damaged relationship with their dad. She really turned them against him.

The irony though is that this is perfect evidence of how terrible SHE is as a person and how NOT terrible he is. I wish they could see her for who she truly is 🤷",2020-07-07 15:45:47

i5hl2i,"This is my entire relationship with my mother. I dread talking to her on the phone— not because I don’t love her, but because she just goes on and on and on about every woe and wrong in her life & I hardly get a word in. My life has been extremely stressful lately given my job & I’ve been avoiding taking her calls lately because I just can’t take all of her stress & mine. Our relationship has always been this exhausting and it makes me really sad. I understand that she needs someone to listen to her and empathize with her life issues but it’s too much. IT FEELS LIKE YOURE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF RATHER THAN APPRECIATED FOR BEING A GOOD LISTENER. If you are a friend, mother, daughter etc like this- I hope you can reevaluate your ways because relationships like this can’t last forever 😔",2020-08-07 21:16:47

i5hl2i,"The problem with this issue is those same people who rant and vent to you all the time never return the favor. I’ve had to end friendships because I’m always the one who listens, who’s tender hearted, goes that extra mile. Then when I need someone to be there for me it goes on deaf ears. Gets ignored. So so frustrating. Because I don’t normally complain too much but when I do it would be nice if someone would care/listen 😞😞😞😞",2020-08-07 23:57:50

i5hl2i,"I never comment on Reddit but this post is so  refreshing to see, OP and the rest of the comments are spot on. I have an old friend from high school who is especially bad with this. We would have 3+ hour phone conversations on a weekly basis my freshmen year of college. She was in a toxic relationship and I was desperately trying to help her out if it through GENTLE suggestions and advice. Despite going through some of my darkest months that year, I was lucky if I got a handful of words out of her if I mentioned what was going on in my life. I’m not trying to fault her for that but it would’ve been nice if she would’ve returned the favor of genuinely listening to me for once. It got to the point where I purposely declined her calls sometimes, and even avoided hanging out with her when I was home. My mental health was so low I couldn’t possibly engage in any lengthy conversation, let alone one where I had to give advice. Then came the comments from her “joking” that I never want to talk with her or how I was antisocial because we didn’t hangout like we used to anymore. To this day I can only allow myself to take her in small doses. I hope others realize that it’s okay to have your limits with people, and I sympathize with those who have friends like this. It can be hard, but please take time to listen to your own needs as well ❤️",2020-08-08 00:52:28

i5hl2i,"Don’t take all the blame. The only area in which you could logically deem yourself “at fault” is neglecting to acknowledge at what point you overextended yourself. The best thing to do would have been to set the boundary then and there, instead of letting it built up and turn into resentment. 
But setting boundaries , for some more than others, can be a ridiculously hard thing to do. We’re all at different places in our journey. Go easy on yourself 🧡",2020-08-07 20:02:47
i5hl2i,"Same! But just like with everything, it gets so much better with practice! I for one have made enormous strides just this last year after consciously deciding to prioritize myself and my needs. Sometimes I overcompensate, but I always use those moments to acknowledge it and apologize. It’s better to overcompensate and make adjustments than to continue to over extend yourself and build up resentments that are totally avoidable 🧡",2020-08-07 20:06:19

i5hl2i,"Dont be sorry, they arent my friends anymore 😂. 

If anybody’s reason for negative emotion dump is because they cant help it and need to without taking into account the health and feasibility of person who is on the listening end they are just plain selfish and dont see your problems as problems.

ftuo4p,"I wish this applied to other countries! Fiji airways left us stranded in New Zealand (we travelled before shit hit the fan FYI and it got worse while we were gone). We had been checking the app constantly to make sure our flights home weren’t cancelled, we called multiple times to make sure our flights weren’t cancelled. We were supposed to fly Auckland to Nadi, Fiji and then Nadi to San Francisco home. It appeared they cancelled the flight from Nadi to SFO 2 days before we were supposed to fly out. When we looked up the flight number, it said the flight had been cancelled or changed, but then it also said the flight was confirmed?? We never got an email or call about this change and only noticed cause we checked the app. Shortly after the other flight was “cancelled or changed”. We didn’t know if it was 100% cancelled or if they were rerouting us through a different airport or what. We were on hold for 5 hours with their customer service number only to be disconnected. I understand why they cancelled, they are trying to protect the people of Fiji, I just wanted a little communication so we knew if we needed to book another flight. When we couldn’t get through, we ended up booking flights with Hawaiian air from Auckland to Honolulu and Honolulu to SFO. This cost us an additional $800. Our flight from Honolulu home got cancelled and rescheduled.Between both airports, we ended up spending 48 hours in the airport before we got home! Now Fiji airways refuses to refund and is telling us we can use “credits” up until december of next year even though we have no intention of traveling. The refund amount would be around $1200. 🤬🤬🤬",2020-04-05 03:39:45

gzz5an,"Ysk, depending on where you are from, from a legal standpoint this may not be entirely true. Can't say for certain how it is for other countries, but where I'm at (Canada) a lot of it falls under our contract and employment laws. 

My understanding is that employers are liable for their employees, and are obligated to fulfill the promises of said employees on their behalf. For example, if an employee misquotes you on something over the phone, and you find out it's different in store, then the store still has to give you the quoted price, come up with an offer that is fair, or one that both parties agree on.

In any case, the idea is that every individual employee more or less represents the store. So if a customer has always specially been given x from an employee every time they come to the store, then the store itself has promised to give them x. If there's precedent of them getting that deal every time, the store pretty much has no choice but to honor it. 

Anyways, it might be worth looking into? You're obvs a nice person, so chin up! 😊

gzz5an,Yes! It is illegal in my city to go indoors without wearing a mask and we have sooooo many people come in without wearing one? And corporate is writing people up/ threatening to fire people (in the midst of an unemployment crisis) for getting confrontational aka asking people to follow the law because they don’t want to miss out on Susan and all 10 of her unvaccinated demon babies coming to get a single bagel. But ya know they say “Omigosh I’m so grateful you’re still here. I would go crazy without this single bagel. I appreciate you sooo much” that makes it all better and worth the risk of potentially dying a painful death for the 25 cent profit that the company is probably getting from this sale when she could always mobile order and pick it up a safe distance away from us 😒,2020-06-10 05:24:53

I complained at the Christmas party because I thought it was cheap when we were a million dollar store. That was a big deal for our company, at the time.

I’ve heard “this isn’t as good as last year” (to my face), I’ve heard “What am I going to do with this, I don’t shop here, when we gave out gift cards”….

1. To heal from truama 
2. To mentally and emotionally process 
3. To express feelings I have no words (some how all the things that are unsaid in my mind can escape into clarity on a page.)
4.  lastly to record something important I want to remember later. 


I write out my feelings about people and things that might not even be true, ( they just feel true in the moment) 
I write letter to people I love that I never send. Sometimes it's anger I could never express to them, some times it's love that I don't know how to express untill I do it in the safety of my journal first. 


I used to think I needed to organize my thoughts so I could write them down. That stopped me from journal ing for a long time. Journaling is like other writing. You don't need any organized thoughts before you start writing. Infact, it works better if you don't. 
Journal ing is the act of putting your thoughts and feelings on a page so you can express, or understand yourself better. 
Journaling is a step toward being aware of your honest thoughts and feelings. It's an act of discovery. 🙂",2021-01-03 15:14:35

kib17c,"So, I’ve used a similar technique in a pinch when I was fishing a few years ago, someone fishing not far from me had a dog with them, and while they weren’t paying attention their dog ate a baited treble hook which is TERRIFYING, they started panicking as any pet owner would, I came over to see what the fuss was about, and after finding out what had happened I ran to my truck to see what I had on hand, all I found were cotton balls, I started tearing them apart and dipping them in the drippings from their bait bucket, which the dog ate plenty of, and since their bodies cannot digest the cotton it wound up surrounding the hook and preventing it from causing any internal damage. When it “passed” we were able to take the pup to the vet to have the hook retrieved without causing any trauma. 

Please be aware here, I’m not saying you SHOULD do this, if you can you should absolutely rush to an emergency clinic, but it will likely result in a very expensive and invasive surgery or having to put the pup down if any damage has been done by the time you get there. This particular vet told us that this technique (although risky) saved this pups life.

Who’s responsible?  The company is just a stack of papers filed somewhere.  The employee who enacts said shittiness points to their first line supervisor.  That supervisor points to their own.  And it’s turtles all the way up...  so now we’re at the head honcho.  The CEO...  well that’s “below his pay grade.”  Can’t hold a guy responsible when he never even knew about the problem... so it’s somewhere, where?  Below him?  We just identified that isn’t the case.  Each leadership position below pawned it off on the one above.  

So, no accountability?  Zero?

Can’t punish paper.  Can’t punish the end user.  Can’t punish the leadership.  Can’t punish the boss... where does the buck stop?  

Obviously said customer service rep needs that job.  Needs the money.  We’re agreeing on the point that *they* should not be the ones holding the bag for (insert bullshit).  And yet that’s where they’ve been placed. Where we’ve all decided to place them.  That rep, and the customer losing their mind?  Those people *should* be on the same side...  and yet they aren’t.

kmaxjh,"These posts always make me really sad. I'm an early-mid 30s Australian and grew up in a world where the U.S was a pinnacle of human rights and decency. 
  
I don't know if it's just that things have deteriorated that much or if it was always a mirage but the more I hear about how employees are treated over there and humans in general the more I'm saddened. It seems like an Emporer having no clothes situation to be sure. 😓😓

  
There was a movie when I was a kid that started cracking the veil where a character played by Chris Rock died and inhabited the body of a rich white dude. There was a scene where he was saying something to the effect of ""bullet in the head, you get a bed"" as if it was a novel idea that healthcare is an area where supply should be predicated on need rather than means.  That started my sadness and it continues to this day. 
  
Only the richest of the rich benefit from at will employment and roll the dice, a bandage would be nice healthcare.  If the rage about stimulus cheques was extended to basic medical & nutritional needs with decent minimum wage and for cause requirements I think you would all be so much happier, healthier and wise.

kmaxjh,I worked at a very famous restaurant for years and the wait staff would be charged full price for any mistakes-in addition the restaurant pulled cash out of our tips to pay for the Amex machine. Long story short I went to the labor board for this and they said the incidents were untraceable due to the nature of cash tips. But while we talked - they helped me realize that the wait staff had attended weekly  “training” meetings and were being illegally underpaid a waiters wage for those (which was illegal since there’s no way to earn tips at these meetings). They eventually audited the restaurant and all of us got back pay for the meetings. Never underestimate the labor board. 😀,2020-12-29 16:14:03
kmaxjh,"Well if you don't tip... At all... Sure?

But I don't think it matters their financial situation. 

Just because I ""pitched in"" and their situation is still bad, doesn't mean I am absolved from all responsibility, if you say their financial situation matters for tipping. 

Because then... If I can afford, let's say $100 to tip, and that won't affect me much, but would help the server not starve, am I an asshole if I choose not to give that amount?

At what line am I absolved of responsibility? How much do I give, and at what line am I not an asshole? 

Because basing and guilting somebody based on financial situation... Means you have to decide when the giving person isn't an asshole, and the server could still use more money....

My logic is backwards? HOW? 

If I go with the flow, and give $20 every time I eat out... Do you think things will change for the employer to want to pay them a consistent wage? 

NO. Why would they? I just made sure they don't pay that wage. 

If servers consistently don't make enough, and are always unhappy with the work and pay... They will be forced to pay them better... Otherwise they have no staff and hence make no money at their restaurant. 

By tipping enough to cover the employer's responsibility for wages, I'm enabling they employer to not pay them well. 

Plus, on the flip side, if they do get consistent wages, and like it vs a consistent wage, it could be desired by the server - short sightedly. 

The unreliability and variability in the pay, and the guilt put onto the customer isn't ideal than just paying a servers wage. It also means job security is incredibly hard, as things such as seasonal droughts in customers can drastically reduce pay and make things harder for everybody. 

Plus, this enables tax evasion that's very hard to catch. And while I'm fine giving tax breaks to people who need it, it means people aren't paying their fair share, and MY taxes have to pick up that slack. 

This also means that the restaurant can also likely find a way to write this off as tax deductions, because they are paying less wages. This might be offset by lower costs, and hence higher profit taxes, but this generally doesn't seem to be the case by how much restaurants really want to have low wages. But maybe that's a stretch 🤷‍♂️ 

PS: this argument isn't saying I don't tip, it only makes the case the we shouldn't rationally (I tip because of guilt).",2020-12-29 19:23:40
kmaxjh,"I never said your boss would care of you're unhappy. That wouldn't. 

But unhappy workers... Tend to quit now often. If turnaround / sparse workers can't fill spots... They have to make it more lucrative. 

The standard tip used to be 10%. Now it's 15, and in some places 20%. 

Clearly it's a way to try and get people to pay more while the employer pays less. 

And stay home? If I feel guilty, I just can't participate in eating at a restaurant?

Tipping is LITERALLY designed to guilt the customer to feel bad and tip the server more. That's literally the propaganda and message sent by every business / leader. 

Sorry for being human and being manipulated exactly as scientific psychological data predicted? 

Fuck me then. 

Why should I, the customer, be guilted into tipping more? 

How does that help change the system?

You know what would change the system? If tipping was so low... That every employee knew it wouldn't make much more than minimum wage... And demanded more.... Or they find a different job. 

The only way to incentivize a business is to make regulation, or make it a necessary cost. 

Regulation comes when people are unhappy -- which is why minimum wage exists (and needs to be increased mind you). 

Business necessary costs go up... When the cost becomes NECESSARY (they need to pay this to do business). (Merely emphasizing the NEED aspect hee, not trying to be condescending). 

The only way it becomes necessary to pay workers more... Is when no workers (or not enough) will work for a given wage+benefits package. 

And scarcity of employees who are qualified / willing to do that task. 

Because it's easy to get trained in at serving tables, and there's lots of people able to do it... The only thing that can change is that the wage isn't enough to entice people. 

That'll only change when customers stop being guilted into paying their wages and it's merely factored into the price -- like literally every other service and good. 

Literally every business is trying to make tips common for every type of employee - even ones behind a counter at a gas station, Dunkin donuts, Hardee's, etc.

Fuck no. 

I'll pay the ""ok"" tip amount and not much more unless I got great service over and beyond what's expected. 

While this may seem insensitive -- which in a way it can be spun to be, as the employees feel the stress right away, it really is better in the long run.... Rationally.

He even caught a chipmunk on the balcony ( that I saved because it was still alive/dangling in his mouth) We have sprayed him with the garden hose.

People need to be responsible pet owners and stop overcrowding shelters by breeding their animals or allowing them to have unwanted litters. Then maybe cities can try to address the stray issue more proactively. 
And if you're going to trap a feral cat anyway, you (as an individual or as a city) would be spending the same amount of money getting the animal spayed/neutered, vaccinated and re-released through a shelter/clinic with a TNR program (so that it cannot reproduce and contribute to overpopulation) as paying for a requested euthanasia.

fm1ndp,"You know, a big part of this could be that, for Westerners, you get a chance to SLOW doen and just be with yourself, take more breaks from technology, be present, re-evauate your priorities, learn how to be more human and less like a zombie going through the motions of life and walking with your head cricked down staring at your phone. I think a lot of ppl are probably squandering this time doing the same kindness stuff exclusively that they were doing before, instead of taking real advantage if this time and the space it’s providing to get in touch with themselves, clean out their closet, and learn how to be truly sel-sufficient ;learn gardening, learn knitting, learn how to build a a table from scratch,start a journal, read actual enriching  books, reconnect with loved ones, start a meditation practice...or just flat on ur bed fir 30m and do nothing land just be). These are some of the things I’ve been guided to do, and they are paying off in wonderful ways both tangible and intangible. I just feel so much calmer and more present. Also, reducing my mass media consumption by about 90% has been extremely refreshing - almost life-changing and revelatory, really. It’s almost like there is an unweitten law that one must consume mass media and and news in this society and so be lowered in emotional frequency and vibration, as well as have one’s ability to think independently so be subverted. The media is primarily promoting fear by focusing mostly on the problem, with half, quarter, vague, and non-solutions masquerading as solutions (if you over spray tour home with cleaning sprays, and solvents, etc, you are ale killing your respiratory system as a lot of the stuff in household  cleaners are also found in cigarettes, etc). Not only that but, just going in fear for any reason or strongly grkirvibg you will get the virus will make it more likely...that you will get it. I call this War if the Worlds’ibf yourself. Your body has phenomenal immune system and is further enhanced by maintaining a positive, steady, optimistic attirude. This virus is hyper-overblown, and is also a distraction from what is coming down the pipeline in terms of broadened mass surveillsnce using the 5g/Internet of Things Smart Grid, and implementation of various kinds of social credit score systems in western countries and other countries which do not currently have such freedom-limiting movement restrictions. Fortunately, it will only last for 2 years max or so, and then more people will wake up to their power and demand change. But this is what it will take, unfortunately, for us to get there. Call it the “birth pains,” to the next paradigm where everyone is more supported empowers economically and politically on the planet, power is no longer centralized and hierarchical and authoritarian, and a greater balance between biology and technology is achieved then currently exists. But on an individual level in the interim, if you can stop looking externally soooo much in the ways that you do for Peace and Happiness, and start looking within and start to form a personal relationship with a Higher Power that is more than a convo of trendy science ideas or just science in general, self-belief, and whatever social conditioning/groupthink you’ve been indoctrinated into from birth, you’ll fare much better than you would otherwise. The people who want get through this decently or even thrive would do well to see how they can truly take  advantage of this time by trying some new things or going back to abandoned things that brought them real joy and satisfaction. Take walk of you’re able and enjoy how much cleaner and quieter your environment is right now!😊
This is my advice, and while support and accept all paths truth, I strongly suggest heeding some of my advice, because I care fir everyone on this planet. And I wish for us all to come out of this a much stronger, unified, cohesive Global Society/Collective, then we were before. And I also wish for us, to be motivated more now as global community to start treating this planet like the loving, life-giving Mother that it is, instead of like a 10cent whore, as we have especially since WW2!

js5269,"I feel like we are kindred spirits. I really relate to the communication challenges you described AND the tendency to overfunction doing the emotional labor of others.

It is so hard to put your own need to clear the misunderstanding on hold. This was a huge challenge for me. Isn’t the goal to be rational? Why waste time feeling bad when it isn’t necessary?

I wanted to jump right to the resolution to make myself feel better without doing the work to make them feel better....like me saying I didn’t mean it that way was the abracadabra that would magically erase the problem.

Even if the other person is objectively “wrong,” their feelings are real. I’m so glad that my analogy helped you visualize it more clearly. And just because you join them in their world doesn’t always mean you think they are right. It’s not giving in. It simply means you think they are worthy of your attention and understanding. 

As your afterthought proves, this doesn’t always work. Because sometimes the other person’s emotions have nothing to do with you. They might be projecting something completely unrelated onto you, which is incredibly difficult to navigate. 

Lastly, thank you for the gold and for sharing your experience. ❤️",2020-11-11 19:42:17
js5269,"THIS. Even the worst arguments can end constructively if you try hard enough or actually care enough. 

I really like Carl Rogers approach to conflict resolution where each person must ensure they understand what the other person is literally saying, and what they mean before responding with their side of things. It's not easy but helps a lot, especially with 'difficult' people. 

The latest thing this eejit flipped out over was, I shit you not, lunchboxes. I asked if his housemate had taken some of mine because certain size ones were missing and I wanted it for leftovers.

So the parents (I should say owners, it wasn't slavery but would be too long to explain) went to grab the first guy working in the field and sent him to marry her.

And it was a region that otherwise followed religion very seriously (my grandmother spent a good part of her childhood a hand tied to her back to cure her from being left-handed, the devil's hand) but when it was about you know the thing™ you knew the countryside was here and no one looked too hard under the rug.",2020-08-18 21:54:37

Oftentimes I have to say ""behind"" because a gaggle of chatty servers are blocking a tight corner and won't just move on their own. But equally as often I have to say it when walking behind three or four other cooks lined up at the prep table with maybe a foot of room between their backs and the wall, just so they don't accidentally back up into me.

Like, ‘Am I really capable of that if I get too angry?’). It was just people I loved dying when i was young, then it went into hurting or killing people around 13 (worst time possible imo). Hell, I just had a dream the other day about this stuff. I’ve told my gf a couple times about it because I don’t know who else to tell (parents will probably blame it on video games, no therapist), but she still doesn’t know the full extent.

ia14ia,"I’m also an INTJ and your story hit home for me. I was always bored at school and would be the first person to finish tests or whatever. Being an Asian girl, it fed into the stereotype that I was supposed to be brainy or studious, so when I was confronted with a subject or topic that I wasn’t able to pick up super quickly, it led to shame and guilt. It took me many, many years to figure out that even though school and academics came relatively easily for me, not EVERYTHING in life would be a walk in the park like that. Sometimes it takes work, and that’s okay. 

Growing up this way also stunted my emotional maturity. Because I didn’t have many friends growing up I never really learned how to have meaningful relationships with my peers. Just because you’re “smart” doesn’t mean you know it all! 😆 Thank you for sharing your story!",2020-08-15 14:30:17

ia14ia,"Yes, I am the exact same way although luckily I found out about Mbti a couple of months ago, while I am still 14. I got intp. Everyone around me kept telling me I was smart, but to me it just seemed like everyone else was just really dumb (sorry if this is arrogant, its just the truth) I could grasp complex ideas rather quickly for my age, but I thought I was the standard. To me I feel like I am average and I genuinely hate being called smart. I didnt fit in much with any of the kids. I liked information in general of course as long as it interested me. I didnt fit in with the ""Popular kids"", and I didn't even fit with the ""Weird kids"", of course those terms are subjective but you know what i mean. I don't have a fine Understanding of emotions so I couldn't even really express how I felt. When I tell the teachers I really don't feel that way they laugh it off like I'm being humble or something IM NOT, But after finding out about personality types it helped me connect with people who have pretty much the same problems. Being praised feels good, being praised to much is stressful, but being understood is a Blessing.

ojh5u8,"Meditation really helped me with this!!
Also “you are not your thoughts” HELL yea. 👏",2021-07-13 17:37:38
ojh5u8,"For people wondering how to stop, here are two things my therapist recommends that work for me:

1) A worry window. 🪟 You allow yourself a window of maybe 10 minutes a day where you can worry about anything/everything that comes to mind. Write it down if you want. Then get rid of the paper. If something comes to mind later, stop and recognize that you are worrying and then tell yourself you are only allowed to think about it during your next worry window. 

2) STOP 🛑 your negative thoughts. When you start thinking something negative or spiraling, envision a literal stop sign in your head 🛑 (or something else that comes to mind easily). Tell yourself you are done with that thought, and then, more importantly, replace the thought with something positive or neutral. I personally struggle to replace my thoughts with positive ones, but I can muster up neutral ones, so maybe start there. (Ex: If you're thinking ""I'm a piece of shit and nobody loves me"" -> 🛑 STOP yourself and recognize that you're having a negative thought -> replace the thought: ""I'm a human who makes mistakes. I can get through this."")

I hope this helps even one other person!",2021-07-14 00:58:34

ojh5u8,"I did this for over 20 years of my life.  I was constantly upset, being either sad or angry.  I was pent up with anxiety and could hardly sleep.  I was so pent up that one day while cooking salmon my toddler came up behind me and I jumped and dropped the salmon I had been flipping into butter that splashed into my face.  I immediately had blisters on my forehead and around my eyes that popped when I touched them. I was sitting in the medical clinic within the hour, and realized that I was doing it to myself and literally made the decision to stop.  And I did.  Poof.  My life was better.  I am one of the most laid back people now, am slow to anger and get over what is bothering me by changing the things I can and accepting what I can't.  It really freaked out my husband for a long time.  That was pretty funny 😄",2021-07-14 05:45:07
ojh5u8,"Not that I can answer your question, but sometimes I imagine negative thoughts like a kid in my head constantly nagging for my attention. Sometimes I have to mentally tell him to just shut up. Maybe I'm just weird tho. 😅

Ofc I also do other things like exercise and play video games. I try to keep myself busy as much as I can. It helps when it doesn't feel like kid anymore and more like a freight train. 😂",2021-07-13 20:21:29
ojh5u8,"The first time I was forced to acknowledge the existence of the thought process I knew I had to change. I stopped writing them. I also read books on how to stop thinking a certain way. They weren't helpful. But I kept reading them, because they were all I could find. Most of them came from Amazon.com. They're much better than that AliExpress garbage. And it took a long time before the thought process started slowing down. I'm not sure why. Maybe you just need to do the same thing over and over again until you get good at it. If that's the case, maybe you should try it yourself. The thought process doesn't have to be an actual thought process. You can think about anything. If the thought process is something you don't like, then you shouldn't think it. I wrote this for you because I saw your question. I hope it helps. Good luck.🤧",2021-07-13 23:06:36

It was a cake, a shiny new bike and a surprise visit from my nanna...

i3afg9,"Don’t be confused if a Hispanic mother gets upset, covers her baby, or turns her baby (baby, toddler; small child) away if you look, smile, wave at them. It’s some stupid superstition that if you look at the child you’ve allowed a gateway for bad spirits. I’m Hispanic and didn’t know this until it happened to me and my mom had to explain lol  I couldn’t understand why the mother looked at me so offended and moved her child to not face me.

Edit: after feeling crazy, irunforbeer has confirmed what I said and explained it better 😂",2020-08-04 02:50:07
i3afg9,"For whatever reason children always choose me to interact with and I can’t say I am mad about it at all.  They can be so hilarious to interact with when they are old enough to have conversations but young enough that they still have an abundance of curious innocence left.

My favorite thing to do is compliment them.  “I love your sparkley shoes!” or “That’s a really cool toy you have!” or “I love your hair!”.   They always, ALWAYS have some really interesting and unexpected reply to your compliments, always super hyped to tell you about whatever they are excited about.  They definitely appreciate your compliments as much as any adult would. 

Babies always get a smile/wave or a silly face because lets be honest, is there anything more pure then when you make a face at a baby and they do that cute baby laugh at you?  Oooooor soul crushing when you smile at them and they break out into a horrified face before screaming like you’ve just tortured them.  (And you start silently apologizing for your hideous, offensive ogre face.)  😂😂",2020-08-04 16:02:22

To all the adults that tried to be friendly to me, it makes me feel so bad because I look at them as if they just insulted me.

hki79d,This is just coincidence but I got hit by a deer at Christmas on my back bumper. My 5 year old son thought it was a reindeer. Since then I dunno... we have observed 4 to 5 instances of deer’s since then.  The last time we saw a deer he saw it first and told me to slow down. My dad had told me this about always being more than one deer and I shared it with my son. I am guessing he will share it with his kids one day too.❤️,2020-07-04 04:11:21

gwb9ky,"I completely agree. I am not adopted but I had a friend in elementary school that was. We had gone in multiple family trips together and one day she told me she had to tell me something with a terrified look on her face. Then she told me that she was adopted and was afraid I wouldn't want to be her friend anymore. Of course I still wanted to be her friend, I thought it was awesome that she had been adopted by her parents (they were wonderful people) but I always wondered how her mental state surrounding it was since she was afraid people wouldn't want to be her friend just because she was adopted. 😔",2020-06-04 11:22:46

I'm of Ukrainian origin and I was raised by a French-speaking family in Canada. I could tell something was off even in an adoption of the ""same race."" Idk, sometimes an intercultural adoptee can still tell. 🤔 Strange how that works. 

I wish my adoptive parents investigated my family history of anxiety. Haha. I started having panic attacks after they told me at 12. 

It can be a shock, sometimes. The younger, the better. :) I wish they had told me earlier, like you. All adoptive parents should be open about it. Not just interracial adoption parents. Because adoptive children can always tell something is fishy. They already know.",2020-06-04 17:33:38

Game and application downloads are often listed in gibibytes, while your storage capacity is advertised with gigabytes, but the OS interprets capacity and available space in gibibytes.

b9dqfe,"You should know...
This happened to a family friend of mine who runs a little cafe in town a year or so back, and she began to see negative reviews popping up here and there shortly after.

One of the bad reviews was so egregious, she decided to contact Yelp’s customer service to try and have it removed. The review in question mentioned “The lady behind the counter, bla bla...” and went on to describe an interaction that DIDN’T happen. She WAS the only “lady behind the counter”, and she knew this review was 100% bullshit...

Anyhow... Yelp put her through the rigamarole, having her call a different number, stay on hold forever, etc etc. Later, she contacted them via email as well, and reached the same dead end. When she finally reached someone who seemed like they could help, she was asked if she would ever be interested in advertising with Yelp.

Incensed, she said “No! I’m just trying to resolve my issue”...

Surprise surprise! They weren’t able to remove that review after all 🙄

Thus he thinks I don't work in a ""decent job"" as an employee because I don't want to - not because even if I found someone willing to hire me, my medical condition would make me keep missing deadlines.

I'm way beyond counting the times people misinterpreted my ever present fatigue for laziness.

These days, when I tell people about my condition, I allow myself to set the tone this way:

Employers shouldn't be allowed to be in charge of providing healthcare, and then also hold employees liable when health problems prevent them from being maximally productive.

They were so sure that I was looking for pain pills. I wanted more than that. I wanted to be cured. I was in pain 24 hrs a day and didn't know exactly why. I knew I had pain walking and thought it was my lower back or sciatica nerve at first. When I told my surgeon why it had taken so long for me to get to him because of unnecessary referrals and misdiagnosis including diagnosing it as a mental health issue ( malingering and depression) he was really angry. At this point my cartilage was completely gone and my hip was beyond end stage arthritis. It was now making a groove into the bone.  The diagnosing should be left  to the real professionals.

Tell your medical doctor what's going on and ask for documentation or a doctor's order to be allowed light work or modified work or medical leave. I don't know where you live... I live in the US and every time I've had a medical issue, a doctor's note and documentation has helped a lot, and was required for me to take medical leave. If you have documentation and orders from a doctor, your work can't really say anything.  They can't say it's depression if they're not a licensed medical professional able to legally diagnose you. I absolutely hate bosses that think they know what's going on when they have no clue.... One day back in 2008, I woke up and was having a miscarriage (I was 8 weeks pregnant at the time, early on.)  I went to the doctor and they did an ultrasound and confirmed the fetus wasn't viable anymore, they actually couldn't find it, my body had already discharged it. I got a note for work and I called in to tell the manager I couldn't come in that night. He said, ""Ok, but if you start feeling better in a few hours, we really need you to help out."" I was like ""What?!  I will bring you a doctor's note."" .... He had no clue. I still think about that to this day and get irritated.

I was tested for HIV, hepatitis , lupus (twice because the first one was positive so had to wait three months and test again) , rheumatology problems , anemia (possibly causing fatigue) etc. All while my liver function tests were sky high. My inflammation markers were sky high. Kidneys not right. Etc.  We did the usual “your chest pains are caused by anxiety” dance. X ray clear. No blood clots in lungs. And eventually another doctor (after 8minths)  has come to the conclusion is probably post viral and therefore long covid. Did another lung scan and I have (8 months post viral) enlarged lymph nodes in lungs which I’m now waiting to get investigated by the right department. 

And even with all those tests. All those appointments with specialists over 8 months, my sick note says joint pain is why I can’t work. 🤦🏻‍♀️

iibeaq,"Exactly. But people who don’t want to accept that our minds, just like our bodies, operate differently. So until they break through that manipulation of “theres only one way a brain should operate, and that way is what is ‘normal’” and that “normal is the correct way..” 

They will never understand. There is no “normal.” There is, however, a special chosen particular mindset that helps the system they built run in the way that they can keep tabs on. Or more recently, in a way they can simply control. 

Example — school. Which was your example and I had a VERY similar experience when it comes to the education system. 

Like guys, I almost failed out of fuckin high school. I graduated with a 1.9 GPA. I hated school. I FUCKING HATED SCHOOL. But I loved learning. I didn’t mind writing essays, and the one example I can think of that prob relates to most ppl is testing. 

In high school, I used to ask if I can take essay tests instead of multiple choice. I suck at multiple choice tests but I knew the material I was being tested on. 

“No. Nobody gets special privileges” — every teacher ever lol

Yeah okay as if most ppl ASK to write a shit ton more than they have to. But my mind doesn’t process multiple choice tests the way they think it “should.” My intelligence was measured through a test that I could not take and do my best.

So I wrote in the ways that EVERY answer could possibly be the correct one. Because THAT I can do. I can do words. I can write thoughts. I can recall info in THAT way, and not the way where it gives you 4 choices. 

It wasn’t asking for anything that wasn’t possible, I was asking to take a test in the way my mind processed the info. 

College though? More freedom. 4.1 gpa, full scholarship to a 4 year college after 2 years at community college. I didn’t get into anywhere else because of simple shit like ^ that. There are 3 main learning techniques that brains have, but our system only accommodates one. 

YOU are most certainly not a problem or “the” problem. More people know that now than you think, but that’s irrelevant bc it doesn’t matter what WE think, they’ll never alter it.

It barely matters HOW we think let alone WHAT we think. They don’t LIKE when we think. They don’t LIKE different ways of thinking. And a lot of ppl got bred to believe that this ideal was The Right One ™ 

But it’s frustrating. If you aren’t who they need you to be in the way you need to be in order to succeed in the way they need you to, then you are labeled as, for lack of better words, broken

But hey, I’m 32 now, and succeeding out of spite isn’t the worst thing in the world. So take that spite and resentment you have and use it. Use it in a way that helps ppl with exactly what you struggled with. 

Why? Bc you can! And bc they can’t stop you from doing that. So they can manipulate the minds of those they reach, but ppl like us cannot be forced to think in that way

And that’s a GOOD thing. It’s what they hated about us in the first place which, to me, is a great opportunity to dominate their shitty control tactics and help those who feel expelled from life in the way that they expelled you from school. Which is crazy btw and a horrible thing to do to anyone, sorry u had to go school like that :/",2020-08-29 18:31:29

Hardships is the world showing you that you have the strength it takes to truely Live a Life worth Living..  So if it hasn't broken you by now fully - it never will. And that's a real reality to stick with.

People like you put the quality in quality of Life. Because you realize what's important and what's not...  everybody else is too lost or preoccupied to know what to do. So even though the world is tough on you - do the opposite.  Don't be tough on yourself.

Life is about being a service to one another to as we serve ourselves. It's a cycle of serving and service.  Don't trip on the fact if Life is calling you to serve. It called you to serve because you are amongst the best and of a chosen few who actually could.

And don't feel bad if people can't relate what you are going through.. because they can't.   Even ""good"" people being they are good - still can't relate to extraordinary. And you are extraordinary.   That's only a small percentage of people that can truly relate to that - to everyone you are at best ""admirable"" which is not something they will want to easily express or if / ever actually show or tell you.   Normal just can't relate to Extraordinary.  Even the Extraordinary still can't relate to special. And you may be both... if not. Then be both.

kbeyg3,"In addition to this, rather than warnings, prepare kids ahead of time by explaining what their behaviors are expected to be. New situations are incredibly stressful for little kids (especially very little ones) and they need constant support in the form of modeling good behavior as well as knowing the expectations.

If, for example, you're going to be going to the post office with a kid who's never done it before, you let them know that it's not a fun place with toys, but it is an interesting place with lots of things to look at. Prepare yourself, as well, by entering the building knowing they might get bored and act out, and plan your behavior accordingly. Know ahead of time that you might have to deal with a melting down or misbehaving child and do what you gotta to keep it at bay for as long as you can. Point to all the interesting things you see and name them. Ask the child if they can name any of the things that *they* see. Play I Spy Colors/Shapes. Give the kid a simple background of the mail system and what happens, where things go, and what it's for. Ask them who they would like to send mail to and ask them what kinds of things they wish they could get in the mail. Once you get to the front of the line, pick up the kid if you can or ask them to be a big helper and Hold Something so they concentrate on staying near you long enough to complete the transaction.

Telling the kid ahead of time that you will do a lot of waiting together and that it might be boring but you'll try to make it fun. Tell them they will stay near you the whole time because sometimes there's lots of people in there and they don't need to have a child in their space. Tell them that once you're done you can have a fun activity like going for a nature walk, a scavenger hunt, a fun trip to the grocery store, or even just going for an interesting drive.

Kids want to be liked, they want to feel like they've done a good job, and they want to work for rewards. It's a natural behavior for them. Use it to your advantage! ☺️",2020-12-12 03:01:44
kbeyg3,Have you heard of the chancla? 🩴,2020-12-12 04:12:57
kbeyg3,"Its about discipline not punishment. I have explained to my daughter that discipline is like a map to keep you out of trouble in the future. Its a bit of discomfort now to remind you to make good choices later. Punishment is about a parent trying to repair emotional damage caused by a child questioning their authority. Its self-centered and pushes the child away from you increasing the chance of further rebellion. 

I do believe that warnings are important though. Kids are like partially programmed computers. Sometimes they dont have enough input to understand the consequences of their actions. Unless they are acting out badly they deserve the benefit of the doubt and a small reminder that they are getting close to trouble. First I ask her if she thinks she is making a quality choice. Is she continues, I remind her that she has had one warning and wont get another (which is actually a second warning in disguise 😁) She is well behaved and polite but still independent and",2020-12-12 09:52:19

kbeyg3,"Agree. I have a 4 and a half yr old and we are in the thick of it right now. I'm constantly having internal battles in my mind about making sure his life has routine and structure/ consistency, while keeping in mind he's  a young kid, during a pandemic, shut inside because of winter.

kbeyg3,"This was really sweet 🥰 thank you for sharing! I know there are a lot of people who don't really like children, especially children that aren't theirs, but I know that that's what makes my job all the more important. I genuinely like children. I get to spend all day with little minions who do my bidding, who run across the lawn chanting my name when I drive up to their house, who cry when it's time for me to leave, and who adore me and think I'm the greatest. In return, I get the pleasure and privilege of watching them grow. There's no better job!!",2020-12-12 06:15:24
kbeyg3,"It makes it so much easier!! Even as adults it's easier to know what kinda place it is that you're going to. What's the dress code? What sorts of people will be there? Will I know anyone? Will I have to dance?? Lol. You'd give your buddy a heads up before taking them somewhere new - do the same with the kiddos! They're your buddies, too 😜",2020-12-12 16:02:09
kbeyg3,"Practice! I'm personally an extrovert (especially when it comes to kids - I keep to myself just fine most of the time but when kids are around I chat) so helping you is going to be a little tricky for me but I can try! What might help is holding the kiddo close or crouching to their level to keep your voice down while you chat with them. You could bring something like a scavenger hunt to places - a checklist of shapes, colors, and objects that you're guaranteed to see in a public place (clock, something dark blue, something pink, something with stripes, something round, something that looks hard, something that looks squishy, somebody with sunglasses, somebody with colorful hair), and each of you gets a list or a bingo card and you cross off things you find together.

If the kiddo is an introvert, too, you could bring them an interesting book to read or look at (if kiddo is smaller or is untrustworthy with books, I suggest getting a book that's geared towards teething babies or toddlers so they can fiddle with it for a while before getting bored. A notepad and coloring supplies are also good and are always developmentally appropriate. 

If the kiddo is an extrovert I wish you luck 😅 what you'll probably want to do is keep their attention focused on you, which of course involves you focusing *your* attention on *them.* This is important because if their attention wanders, they'll do what I do and make friends with strangers and then you have to interact with their ""friends"" which can be difficult. My biggest worry with my charges interacting with other adults without my presence is that they'll say or do or hear something that I would rather they did not and the other adult will make them feel like it's okay. Yes, you might not feel insulted if my charge is behaving rudely, but the charge still needs to understand why that particular behavior is impolite. Most of my kiddos have been pretty polite, though, cause they've all got good parents who also instill good manners into their lil noggins 😋

Anyway I digress, sorry. I would say practice makes perfect. I'm not gonna tell you people aren't gonna be watching or listening, cause they absolutely will be. I've had lots of folks listen in on my chats with my charges. It makes lots of people smile, and some people even join in if it's an interesting enough conversation!

Parents know their kiddos best and know what their tolerances are. If you're out with your wee one and you have to go to the post office, like in my example, you know before you even step foot in the building what's up with the little one. Are they hungry? Is it nap time? Have they had any water lately? Are their clothes and shoes comfortable? Are they easily overstimulated, especially by noise (lots of post offices have banging sounds in the background and some can be echo-y)? What about new places, new situations, or strangers? Are they gonna lose it in five minutes if you walk in that door, or can they be a champ and stick it out for a little while longer with the promise of a nice, decompressing, routine thing like hot dogs at your favorite hot dog joint? If you really, really, really need to send that package and have no other options, and you think your little friend might throw a fit, it might be worth it to compare the idle chatter to the screaming: both are uncomfortable but one is significantly worse.

As for things like grocery shopping, malls, or other places you go with wee ones but don't have to stand around or in line, practice there! Go to the grocery store, cram em in a cart, and walk up and down every single aisle (except maybe not the candy/cookie aisle :P) and just talk about the things you see. These are fruits, these are veggies, this is milk, this is cat food. What do you see on this packaging, that box, this canister? What color is it? Do you think this looks yummy? We can find a recipe, if you'd like to try it!

This is a good way to help them with impulse control, too. I teach all my youngsters that just because we're going to the store does not mean they're gonna get something. Sometimes good behavior begets a reward, sometimes it doesn't, but misbehavior always results in a consequence. Sometimes it's just a gentle reminder, sometimes it's a more stern reminder, sometimes we leave the area, sometimes we leave the store. This last one is easier for me - if I have a kid with me I'm at work, and I make sure all my parents know that there's literally nothing that's more important than their child's welfare, including doing the shopping. If my charge **needs** to go home, we go home. Mom or dad can pick up the chicken and rice from the store on their way home, but this baby needs a nap!

But a kid who understands that good behavior is expected and understands that no rewards will be given can enjoy a nice trip through the aisles discussing what foods look interesting and which don't. I had a kiddo who equated going to Michael's with getting a toy truck because they have a small display of diecast cars available there and he's a big fan. I told him we were going to go there for some supplies and he got way too excited about getting a car. I had to stop what I was doing, get to his level, and have a whole entire conversation about not getting a car. He was, of course, bitterly disappointed and I knew he would be so I gave him the time and space he needed to process his disappointment. It delayed our trip by about 45 minutes because he was so upset after getting so excited. The poor guy's emotions were way too big for his body - both the elation at getting a toy and the frustration from having it denied him. We talked a lot and I told him if he wanted to call the trip off entirely, that was okay, because I could go by myself another time. His FOMO (fear of missing out - a common affliction in toddlers 😂) won him over and he agreed to come along and be a big helper. He told me he wanted to look at the cars and I agreed after making sure he understood that we wouldn't get any to keep. He told me he understood and I reiterated - if we think we will have a hard time saying goodbye to the cars when it's time to go, we can't go see them. He got it. We talked about it the whole drive, the whole time in the parking lot, and on the way into the store. Just lil ol me, repeating myself ad nauseum, saying ""ok, but we will look for a few moments with just our eyes, and then we will get X, Y, and Z, okay? Do you still wanna be big helper, or do you just wanna walk?"" We looked at the trucks in all their splendor, I gave him several head's up warnings that time was running out, and we made sure to say good bye to the best trucks in the bunch. We told them we hoped we'd see them later. His reward for his restraint was a really big hug (which he loved, and loves to this day), and I spent the rest of the trip praising him up and down. ""Wow, bud, just wow! You really did a great job! I told you that we wouldn't have very much time, you listened so well to my words, what a great job you did! I really liked how you said bye bye to that big red truck. I'm really glad you had a good time looking at them all! I'm happy you came with me and helped me get the things we needed. That was really fun! You did a really great job in there! Thanks for all your help, bub!"" The whooooole trip. Positive attention, positive affirmations, and recognizing the struggles that he went through are all ways to help encourage future restraint, build resilience, and forms a loving bond between me and the kiddo. Kids WANT to be good. Full stop. I've never met a child that didn't, in their hearts, want to be good, and I've been a nanny and a preschool teacher. Giving them good attention is helpful and kind and creates a lasting, trusting, loving connection to them that can't be made anywhere or any way else.

So.. positive attention, but in ways that are comfortable for both of you, are the ways to have great outings with kiddos in public 😁😅 I tend to get a little sidetracked and talk a lot when I talk about things I'm passionate about. Sorry for the long read!!",2020-12-12 07:21:27
kbeyg3,"Oh boy, I feel your struggles! I had a little man who has severe ADHD and his mom and I worked as a team to help him, even though I was just a once-weekly babysitter. I was with him every Wednesday afternoon for three school years (his mom was a teacher at another school and so didn't need my assistance over the summer, as she was off, too).

He taught me so much. One of my most important core values with children is gentle patience, and he taught me a LOT about that, especially when he was littler! Impulse control was sooo hard for him, so if something happened at school he'd have a really tough time controlling his reactions. When he was in second grade, he got daily reports about his behavior that the teacher would give to me and explain at pickup. If he had a rough day I could usually tell just by looking at him. We (his mom and I) would give him extra screen time and treats if he'd had a good day and would reduce those things if he hadn't. It was a daily reward system to encourage him to think about his actions in the moment during the day. It worked pretty well!

On the days when he'd had a rough time, I made extra sure to give him loving, positive attention, tell him good things about himself, and encourage him. I never, ever, ever scolded him for things he'd done four hours prior - he knew that he'd misbehaved and he didn't need me rubbing it in. I'd talk to him about thinking about things before we do them, about how I know he knows that and it's okay that he slipped up. I never got mad at him for having a rough day. His mama could have gotten mad, but for me, I saw it as me being the one a week stand-in, so while I had to uphold her values and stick to her kiddo's routine, he didn't need extra people mad at him, especially when we ALL knew he was struggling.

We played board games together a LOT the whole time I babysat him, so on the days when he'd lost screen time privileges, we busted out the board games together. He's fifteen now and he and I both have strong, happy memories of playing fun games together ☺️ I taught him that playing fair and not cheating are paramount when you play with others, and that if he was ever caught cheating that I would back out of the game and he'd have to find something else to do on his own. One instance I will never forget for as long as I live, it's as clear a memory as if it happened yesterday - we were playing Monopoly and I landed on his property and had to pay him $6 in rent. Instead of the $1 and $5 bills I intended to give him, I picked up a $1 and a $50. As I handed them to him, his face turned serious and he looked back and forth between my eyes and the money and went ""Ummm, Molly??"" I looked, saw what he saw, and laughed. I put the 50 away and picked up a 5. I handed them to him and said something like, ""Boy, I'm glad you said something!"" Lighthearted and laughing, you know? But his face stayed dead serious and he said ""Well, I'm not a cheater and neither are you."" My heart grew three sizes that day. I was so touched that he took what I said to heart enough to be serious about it.

They're such special kids. Sure they're a handful, sometimes more of a handful than we can carry in our two hands, but they have so much to teach the world. I know my kiddo taught me a ton. Thank you for sharing with me!",2020-12-12 15:13:48
kbeyg3,That's a high compliment! I actually am not a parent but in my work as a nanny I've been a stand-in parent for three kiddos and an extra parent to several others. It's genuinely my pleasure to help children and their parents alike ☺️,2020-12-12 04:00:47

kbeyg3,"Thanks for the mention and the kind words! I'm glad to continue the conversation.

It's a hard thing to discuss but yes, everyone has a different approach to parenting in general and discipline in particular. As a nanny I've had to deal with that head on. I was raised in what's called an authoritative household. I was given expectations but one of the biggest expectations my folks had was that I would bring up anything that was making me feel bad. They were strict (dad moreso than mom but dad made the rules growing up) but they were very fair. It drove my mother insane - everything between my sister and I had to be equal. She obsessed over it (though I never would have known had she never admitted to it when I was older).

The loving tenderness that my parents feel for their children has never been in short supply. They'd indulge us, listen to us, *hear* us, and take what we had to say into consideration. My dad would listen to me tell him what I'd dreamt about over breakfast every single day. My mom loved listening to me tell stories and encouraged me to write them down (even though in retrospect they sucked 😅). I could be an absolute loser and she'd still think I'm the cat's pajamas. They both love the heck outta me.

That's the approach I take. Everything is rooted in that. It's rooted in my desire to watch them grow well, in my hopes for them to be good people, for them to just be great and happy. When the people you love are happy, it makes you happy. When the people you love are able to keep it together during a trip to the post office because you two have a ball together, it makes you happy. When your little best friend is having a hard day and really wants that ice cream, it won't make them happy. It will make them understand that being upset leads to rewards, and will make them understand that in order to get those rewards, they have to make themselves feel Not Happy. (Kids don't like tantruming, either! I wrote up another novel-length comment (thank my mom for encouraging the story telling 😁) about what tantrums are for kiddos, if anybody's interested in reading it.) When your little best friend has to be Not Happy around you in order to get things they want, they spend their whole entire lives Not Happy in the hopes of getting your coveted attention, a sweet treat, or some other positive reinforcement. A kiddo who knows their boundaries and knows the drill and knows the expectations is a child who doesn't have to purposely get themselves upset to get rewards. Sure, they might still flip their lids and get bored/hungry/tired/overstimulated/other, but at least you were prepared for it and knew it was coming. That helps you AND it helps them.

kbeyg3,"I remember the babysitter my sister and i had when we were in our elementary school years. She was wonderful and fun and kind and knew how to encourage kids to try hard to be the best version of themselves (behaving, being good to others and yourself, having interest in the world around you, etc). I'll always remember her fondly. I'm sure all the kids that you have cared for over the years will remember you and appreciate how fortunate they were to have you as their nanny 😸",2020-12-12 14:38:17
kbeyg3,"EXACTLY

If you can put yourself in your kids shoes and try to understand what they’re dealing with you can actually start to help them rather than just coerce them.

I was going to call you out on using praise as a reward until you said it wasnt, its unconditional because kids need to feel appreciated and loved 😍😍😍

I love alfie kohn “punished by rewards” on that front. You cant just bribe and punish kids into being good people, that doesn’t nurture morality it nurtures self-interest and insecurity.

Kids need time! They need support, guidance, acceptance, respect, and TRUST.

We need to write a new YSK post. “You Should Know most of the parenting advice on here is authoritarian and uses stress and trauma to create repressed and compliant kids, rather than joining them in their own efforts to succeed based on their strengths and understanding”. Lol

kbeyg3,"Difference being the toddler eventually grows into an adolescent with its own ability to construct thought and argument to imposed rules. Potentially denying what was through fair reasoning and rebellion. The dog just gets slower. 

Raising a kid involves education as well as discipline. Teach them why things are the way they are and empathise that as kids they have no power so rules etc mean life changing consequences in their reality (similar reason for highschool feeling the most important thing ever when there) creating a fine balance of understanding and respect whilst being open to change or challenge. Listening to their opinions etc helps create a great base for life in general all the while enforcing the understood and accepted rules by following through is tough. 

Guess that's why we lament and look with rose coloured glasses at the time we could kill two birds with one stone and sort the dog and baby together 😜 sorry I'm teasing now but I ain't denying you are wrong though either.",2020-12-12 03:41:33

kbeyg3,"That's fair, and an excellent point! When I say happy, I mostly just mean they're okay with themselves. If I work just to make them happy, they'll get a lot of stuff that they think will make them happy but will actually be stuff that's detrimental to their growth in the long run. I get asked how I deal with tantrums and fights and my answer is always tongue-in-cheek: I don't negotiate with terrorists. I love children of all ages, shapes, and sizes, but they can be little beasts sometimes! I have a personal moral that I live by with kids, which is to never give something that a screaming child wants unless it's something like a band-aid or a hug.

Offering choices is a huge deal to me and I give children choices at every available opportunity. It gives them agency over their body/surroundings/environment and it teaches them all kinds of good things. But sometimes you gotta do stuff that sucks and you don't get to choose not to do it. That's when I use the gentle reminder, ""Sometimes we get to have choices about things and sometimes we don't get to make choices. Brushing your teeth before bed is not something you can make a choice about. You can choose where you brush your teeth, you can choose if you want to put jammies on first and which jammies to wear, but you can't choose not to brush your teeth. Sorry, bub."" In this way I'm making them ""happy"" by teaching good habits, giving them things that they can use to make a silver lining, and, in this particular example, helping their dental hygiene. Sure, they might hate it, especially since I make them reeeeally brush. But I'm not here to give them what they want. I'm here to make them be good people.

In some cases, the word 'happy' can be substituted with 'resilient.' By encouraging kids to do things they don't like, by helping them get through a stressful trip to the store, by giving them the expectations and giving consequences for misbehavior - all these things will lead to an adult that can control themselves, that can withstand difficult situations, that can do unpleasant things and get them over with with little to no fanfare or difficulty. In that sense, I've helped make a happier person. I myself am overall pretty happy, although I also struggle with depression 🤔 being in the dark when you can't help it really makes you appreciate the light!!! I've been made happy both by that and because I was raised with love by people who wanted me to succeed, who were proud of me no matter what I did, and who support me even though I sometimes have a rough go of it. I wanna do that for all my kiddos, and teach them that happiness can be found in simplicity, in doing what's right, in doing things that are uncomfortable but good for you, in having a day where you don't talk to anybody, in making decisions for yourself that are healthy.

Happiness takes so many forms ☺️ thank you for your reply!! You're very right - just trying to make a kid happy is too much work and will lead to an unhappy kid who's used to having their needs met at any moment without having to sustain themselves. Not a happy person. Thank you for pointing that out and allowing me to clarify!",2020-12-13 01:03:19

kbeyg3,"Ooh that's rough, for sure. It's hard to find a balance, sometimes, especially when you've got a curious kid.

My first question as I read your comment is wondering what kind of daily structure your bigger kiddo has. Obviously that in and of itself is a monster of a struggle what with covid going on, no babysitters, no school, and so on. A daily schedule where she is expected to be in a certain part of the house at a certain time (examples: sleep schedule, study schedule, outdoor play schedule [assuming you don't live in a frozen wasteland yet 😅 or have the necessary equipment/clothing for her to go outside]) could leave you and your partner free to discuss scheduled topics.

I'd also focus on that last bit - scheduled topics. My own parents absolutely never discussed money or finances around my sister and me, so that would be one I'd personally keep between grown-ups. Discussions of grievances with each other, annoying things at work, whatever else you'd prefer kept secret - have a scheduled adult time where you can discuss those things. My favorite time is between the kids' bedtime and my bedtime. I was a live-in nanny for my cousin and we all loved having ""adults sitting around talking"" time, after the babies were in bed and their white noise machines up and loud. I also believe that this is when my mom and dad would discuss things together.

As for setting boundaries, it's like any other type of discipline. I always start with an outline of the rules (if they're new) in a moment when the kids aren't doing anything wrong. I tell them in that moment that I'll help them remember and that I want THEM to help ME remember, too (modeling of appropriate AND inappropriate behavior both help strengthen the kids' understanding, by telling them you expect them to call you out on it and going ""oops, you're right, I shouldn't have done that. Silly me. Thank you for keeping an eye on me! I'm really proud of you for remembering that! You're really good at that."" and correcting your own behavior. It takes a lot of humility for some folks to be able to admit that they're wrong to their own children, but that's life. Nobody likes it when someone bends their own rules but doesn't let it bend for others, or gets mad when they get called out for bending the rules.).

I'd start by sitting her down and saying, listen, sometimes Mom and Dad (or Nanny and Mom, or Nanny and Daddy, or whoever the adult guardians are)  need to have a conversation about things. It's not stuff we want you to worry about, okay? It's kinda like when you want to tell your friends about something, or tell just Mama about something, or just Grandma. Kinda like that. If it's ever something that's important for you to know, we'll tell you, I promise. It's possible that she won't really catch on to it. If you know right away she won't get it, you could skip it, I suppose, and go right to the discipline part, but it still might help her understand that she's not privy to everything. It will also make it so there's an even playing field - she'll remember your talk with her and will be reminded of it every time there's disciplinary action taken.

If you do tell her and she still eavesdrops, I would do at least two things. I would start giving gentle reminders every time she's caught. ""No, thank you, Anna. I'm only talking to Dad right now. I need you to give us some space for five minutes and then we can talk."" ""No, thank you, Miss Anna. Let me finish talking to Mama about this and then I can help you."" You're also going to need to tell her (during the sitdown I mentioned in the last paragraph, please) what's expected of her when adults are talking. Should she go to her room? Go hang out with the little sib? Go to her play area? Go watch a screen? Go outside? That way you're not just telling her what she can't do, you're helping her out by telling her what she CAN do. ""Hi, Anna! Let me finish telling mama what I need to tell her. Can you go read a book in your room for a few minutes, please, and I'll be right in to read with you? Thank you!""

Step two is gently reminding her that she doesn't need to worry about whatever you guys were talking about. She might be a bit old for redirection, especially if she's used to weaseling the details out of you 😄 but it's a good, soft start. ""What were you guys talking about?"" or ""Why were you talking about going to the bank?"" ""Not to worry, Miss Anna! What book are you reading?""

As a formerly inquisitive child myself, I will say that the above might not work. If/When redirection doesn't work, a more firm reminder is needed. ""That was Mama and Daddy talk. Remember that we're keeping our conversations with each other separate? Remember what I said the other day, about letting Mom and Dad have a chance to catch up when Mom gets home from work? That's what this was, right? Okay, so we're gonna keep trying to let mom have a moment when she gets home to only talk to daddy, right? Cool. Thank you for listening to my words. What book did you pick out to read?""

However, setting it up so that there's less room for failure is really the way to go. Plan it so that you know where she is and where she will be at a certain time, and save your chats for then. Send her to the play area and meet your partner at the other end of the house for a quick, quiet chat. Not talking about things while she's around is, as a matter of fact, a really great boundary to have. If/When she outright asks about things that are inappropriate for her to know, a reminder that ""That's Mama/Dada stuff, babes. Don't you worry,"" and then a quick, handy redirection to the next topic.

Another idea to help her grasp the ""this is an A & B conversation, 'C' yourself out"" concept of private convos could be to have Her-Dad and/or Her-Mom and/or Her-Grandma, etc., only conversations. She talks to you about space, perhaps, and you learn about space together, just the two of you. It can be your special \*thing\*. She and your partner can talk about another topic, like animals, crafts, engineering, pets and other animals, history. It can be something you know they talk about but don't get too involved with to keep it special. That way she can distinguish between what's free to know, and what's not",2020-12-15 18:50:49
n7rtiv,"I once picked up a ~~hitch~~hiker who was walking on a beach that is, in fact, ***very*** private - it's owned by the US Air Force and is just down the road from a place that has SEVERAL military police cruisers posted at the gates all day, every day, forever. 24/7/365, zero exceptions. They're there with the one job of watching the gates, so you can zip on by them down the road to the beach at the speed of sound if you feel like it, and they won't bat an eye. They'd probably like it less if you slowed down, as a matter of fact.

Anyway, so we went to the beach, did dumb stuff, and we were coming back and I saw a guy who was very clearly just hiking up the coast. I stopped next to him, rolled my window down, and said ""Hi. Do you know where you are?"" because he was very clearly not an airman (or any other member of the military, not with the unkempt hair and scraggly beard) and I knew from looking at him that he was not on military property on purpose.

He of course said no and told me he was hitchhiking up the beachy coast of CA starting in San Diego. I'm sure there are signs posted in plenty of strategic places, and if he encountered any, he missed every single one. He'd found the road (the *only* road) and decided to follow it, which would lead him not only back to the hustle and bustle of the most strategically important military base on the west coast of the United States (bad) but past plenty of military policemen who would have *a lot* of questions for him (worse).

I told him to get in and decided we'd take him into the nearest municipal location (I think Wikipedia calls it a ""place"" - it was a village nearby named for the base) and drop him off at a corner market there. My friends were unhappy and didn't want to have a stranger in the car with them but it was my car and I didn't really expect this sweet hobo to survive his encounter if he walked past the wrong missile silo.

Edit - was just hiking, not hitching. He wasn't expecting a ride, but also was not (as he claimed) expecting to be in a top secret area of a military base 😬",2021-05-08 23:19:22

n7rtiv,"All good. I come across pretty directly/like an asshole in writing too, so you’re in good company! (I wasn’t offended by anything you said though 🙂👍)

I can’t say I know the stats either, but I grew up in a really low socioeconomic area, I’ve been held up at knife point (at my neck) by a junkie that I managed to talk down, and I worked as a security guard for several years where I deescalated dangerous situations *all the time* with words (the most I ever had was a baton and I never even pulled it out), so I’ve been in those situations more often than I would like. I wasn’t a big, buff guy either - I was a relatively slim/athletic 19 y.o., so I wasn’t really intimidating or anything.

The reality is that if someone pulls a gun on you, you just do whatever the fuck they tell you to. Even if you’ve got a gun, it’s too late. Pull it out and you’re dead 99 times out of 100. Having a gun doesn’t protect you from drive-by shootings or gang initiations either. What are you gonna do? (I say you, but I mean anybody.) Shoot at the car as it drives away? You’re still full of bullets or, if you’re not, you’re just putting other people at risk of getting hit by your stray bullets. At that point you’re just in revenge mode - you’re not actually going to achieve anything - it’s not a deterrent for the people doing the drive-by.

You’re right that alerting someone to the fact that you’re carrying can deescalate the situation *if they’re not carrying too*, but if they are, you’ve just escalated the situation straight to a likely gunfight.

Please don’t take this the wrong way, but I feel like the vast majority of people that share your view re. having firearms *for protection* are victims of clever persuasion by the groups of gun proponents that want easy access to firearms for purposes other than protection, hunting, or stock/wildlife management. I don’t believe that carrying a gun protects you from people who are out looking for a fight (figuratively speaking), especially when they’ve got easy access to guns too; I think it puts you, and everyone else around you, at a *greater risk* because of the ease at which the situation can escalate dramatically, ending in a shooting.

Peace be with you too, mate. Stay safe, and thanks for the discussion! 🙂",2021-05-29 00:27:32

j7cqr7,"As someone who has struggled with fertility issues, I can tell you that they are absolutely not the same thing. When you’re doing fertility treatments, you are testing well before your period is late. I was getting a very faint positive on First Response Early Result for DAYS before my cheap Amazon ones were positive. On pregnancy tests, a faint positive is still a positive, so having something that picks up lower HCG levels makes a big difference. But for the average person that isn’t watching things as closely, cheapies are just fine. 😊 

Another thing to note is that pink dye tests are more accurate than blue dye. Blue dye tests are notorious for giving false results (usually false positive). And for me, I was tracking how much darker my line was every few days. Digital tests are useless for that. In this picture, you can see that I ripped my digital test apart because I wanted to see the actual line. I was happy to see a really strong dye stealer on this one!! https://i.imgur.com/ICHcNB7.jpg",2020-10-08 17:17:28
j7cqr7,"I’m going to piggy back off this comment to say that if you are sexually active, it’s not a bad idea to keep pregnancy tests on hand.


Anyone who has had a pregnancy scare to relate to the stress it causes. Talking yourself in and out about buying a test. Getting the courage to buy one and take it home, only to wonder if the answer is correct, did you take it right? Did you take it too early? Is the stress of not starting your period, keeping you from starting your period? 

Birth control fails, but instead of stressing about a missed period for days at a time, spending $15-25 dollars on at midnight on a Tuesday , sweating bullets. Wondering if it’s too early to tell your partner and causing them unnecessary stress. Spending an hour plus ➕ googling early pregnancy symptoms. 

Having a stash of cheap tests to take whenever you want, at any time, without all the overthinking, stress and anxiety. No more dwelling for days and psyching yourself out. Do yourself a favor and order in bulk on amazon, or grab a few 89 cent ones from Walmart each time you shop there. 
I found out I was pregnant because I was having a stomach ache and weird dreams/insomnia. I felt different and just wanted to rule it out. It was 4 am and saw the 2 lines! We now have a 1 year old daughter and wouldn’t change a thing. 

Whether you are trying/want to get pregnant or just want to take responsibility as mmmmm control over your own sexuality. Unless you practice abstinence, the chance is always there, so there is no shame in keeping them on hand.",2020-10-08 23:40:29

gh26ep,"Same goes for pooping!!! I took in a cat as a rescue through working in a vet clinic who hadn’t pooped in about 5 days and stopped eating after 3. X ray showed what’s called “megacolon” which is exactly what it sounds like! A length of his intestine was completely impacted with feces and had more than quadrupled in size. The owners surrendered him to us as they wanted to do nothing

We did emergency surgery immediately. Luckily his colon was still relatively healthy and did not need to be removed. But the extreme stretching permanently damaged that sections ability to properly contract and relax to move poop along and out. So he took laxatives and ate soft food only from that point on and did fantastic for years. There’s a very high risk of it happening again down the road even with the best management. Several years later that did happened when he was an old man. Surgery would have again been necessary with that section of colon being removed this time. The quality of life would not have been there for him and he would have dealt with chronic diarrhea in this particular circumstance so we had to euthanize him. He had a very good life once he got the care he needed though. Big old orange softie 🧡",2020-05-10 19:51:57

Bacteria grows like crazy in those re usable food containers and can mess up their gut. She recommended buying 15 pound bags and simply rolling the bag shut then closing it with a clip.

I'm sure Ghandi, the President, the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the whole delegation for the Nobel Laureate are beaming upon the fact that you consistently *""call out""* folks with negative karma on reddit comments.

wn1ta3,Meanwhile our needy boy came limping up to us as we were about to go to my birthday meal to pointedly show us his puffed up paw. It was as if he knew it was time to speak up before we went out.

wn1ta3,This happened to my dog. My bf at the time picked up my dog and my dog started yelping and screaming. I rushed to him and yelled at him to put down the dog. My bf said “ he’s just faking it” I’m like how does a dog fake scream. My dog kept holding in his paw and I picked him up gently and rushed him to the vet. The whole time he was just shaking while I held him. The vet gently stretched out his paw and arm and started moving it around to see the extent of the injury. We heard a loud pop and my dog yelped. My vet said looks like it popped his arm out and it just popped back in during examination. My dog doesn’t look at the vet and bf the same any more. 😅 both are on his hit list now.,2022-08-13 17:10:57
wn1ta3,"It very often happens the other way around!

Cats are [manipulators](https://www.livescience.com/5556-cats-control-humans-study-finds.html) and they know how to elicit their needs from their humans. Limping gets extra attention. 

There's plenty of examples on YouTube,  for example (the very fact that they're limping outside where they're more vulnerable, yet when they're inside the house with nobody watching, their limp vanishes. Other times they forget which leg is 'injured' and end up limping on the wrong one 😂)

turns out the flowers gf had gotten from a coworker as a joke were fucking *lilies* and a single petal had fallen from the very tall unreachable-to-an-old-ass-cat shelf we’d placed them on and forgot about them, and that little dumbass ate it. scariest moment of our lives, i’ve never seen my gf cry so hard and it killed me. luckily our nasty baby barfed it up very promptly, and *$2k* of nothing but labs and fluids later she was just fine.

wn1ta3,"I started doing full body checks regularly when I noticed something off after my first dog hid a huge heckin' cut between her paw pads for days, she was secretly licking it and I noticed her paw was oddly wet. I was like, girl, shit! I felt stupid too, because I did full body checks on my horses frequently (horses are stupid and prone to injury and general weird shit).

Visual check first - from nose to tail tip, and yes that includes looking at the genitals and butthole, ears and all. Then physical - check teeth, gums, and tongue. Check feet top to bottom and in-between. Gently flex all joints - furry friends will hide pain so I like to place my hand on the joint as I flex, feeling for sensations of grinding, stiffness, lessened range, or hesitation.

To finish off, a *full body massage*. This is to look for lumps or abnormalities that may be hidden by fur and give a true feel for Fluff's baseline of body condition. I personally also *gently* palpate the abdominal cavity, again for unusual lumps/bumps. Intact males should have their testicles gently palpated, and females should have their mammary glands checked in the same way.

**It is absolutely no different than your doctor giving you a physical.** The vast majority of the time, there will be nothing wrong, but being proactive can mean the difference between catching sickness early or saying goodbye too soon. You should be doing the same sort of thing for your own body. As caretakers, it is our responsibility to do the same for our charges who cannot.

If you're afraid of doing it wrong, ask your vet to show you! I was afraid of hurting my pets, being used to Much Bigger livestock, so I asked for a quick demonstration.

Love your furry friends and keep them safe by gently bothering the shit out of them for their health ❤️",2022-08-13 22:21:29

I saw someone on this thread worrying that people would see this and think that having rejection sensitivity means they've got ADHD.

kkwm36,"I started attending an ADHD group counseling thing a few years ago because I was struggling to find a job after graduating from university.

It was such an incredibly enlightening experience to realize *why* I had struggled so much throughout my life with basically anything I didn't actually enjoy doing, couple that with emotional regulation, rejection sensitivity, and anxiety and you've got a perfect storm 😂. I'm still not formally diagnosed because I've learned to manage for the most part (and medication side effects scare me). 

Things like not receiving a text back right away and my mind running off on the false notion that they might not be interested or want to talk to me really started to make sense. Things like being afraid of suggesting new ideas at work for fear of rejection or them not working as well. 

Working in a high visibility role (management basically requiring proof of everything I did via tangible results) was such a fucking nightmare that I left my previous career path because I couldn't handle it anymore, and that was only after 3 years. I can't decide if it was good to experience a horribly managed company first, or not. I probably would have ended up hating it either way on principle, because I hated how my work contributed to the exploitation of cheap labor through the creation of the process planning - gaining the company millions and me not enough to afford a 1br apartment.

kkwm36,"Real question!

It took over 2 years to get our daughter a diagnosis.  Tons of therapy, multiple counselors, testing, meetings with a psychiatrist, etc.

We were given the following information

""It's possible she is on the autism spectrum but I don't think she is.  Her tests place her on it but with speaking to her and my interactive examination I don't think she fits.  She is also borderline in her tests for combination ADHD, but as I said borderline. She has tested high into social anxiety.  I also would agree that she presents all the signs of ODD but because of her age it has moved to the category of Conduct Mood Disorder.  I would also diagnose, though it is not an accepted diagnosis by the medical community as a whole currently, that she suffers from a non verbal learning disability""

Essentially her biggest things are

-easily angered and hard to calm
-wide range of emotions she can't control
-violent outbursts she really can't seem to have any control over
- trouble reading social cues or understanding culture
-literalness (if you said wow my back is killing me, she'd need to be taught that's a phrase for example.  Once she knows she doesn't forget, but she takes everything literally until taught it doesn't mean literally.  Even if you're laughing when you say it)
-extremely intelligent book/school wise, struggles with fine motor like pedaling, swimming, gymnastics, rhythm, tying shoes, etc
-peels walls, picks at clothing seams, and sometimes her skin until she's covered with sores
-definitely has some sensory stuff going on

We started fluoxetine last summer and it seemed to be going well.  She was a little more sensitive emotionally (to crying) but otherwise she said she felt a lot more like herself and not so out of control.  Then they doubled the dosage and the only difference was her picking her skin/walls/clothes returned.  

So she was weaned off of it and now we are going to attempt a lower dosage in January. 

So if she was so borderline combination ADHD how do I go about looking into it?  The psychiatrist we saw is one of very few in our area and it took so long to even get in to see her.  Our new insurance doesn't even cover her this time so we'd need to find another. Any non medicated treatment plans?  I feel like prior to diagnosis we have gone through every behavior ""plan"" or ""system"" to help regulate.  We've also changed diet, soap, cleaning products, etc.  

She's doing much better than she was but I still see her struggle some days and it's hard.  When she loses control it's bad for everyone but especially her.  

Any advice is greatly appreciated ❤️

She's 9.  

Oh and did I mention she just started showing a ton of signs all at once for early puberty?  🙃",2020-12-27 14:50:19
kkwm36,"People around me to whom I feel a burden sometimes explained how it is for them. Like you feel the emotional build-up and explosion and in the moment you feel that way stronger than the people around you and afterwards you're exhausted and also then you feel things wayyy stronger than the world around you. They just experience the external part of your explosion, or just the moment you're crying or whatever. So they don't feel that build-up and stuff, so remember, that part doesn't burden them AT ALL. So no, it really isn't that frustrating to be around you and you probably also have the beautiful parts of ADHD which just helps to make you a beautiful whole person like the rest of us. Besides yeah for your parents it's hard sometimes, they don't always understand, the thing I have found to work (like 10 years after my diagnosis, I'm 20yo now) is explaining what's happening in your mind after the thing happened and once you're okay again. When they understand what's going on it isn't as scary for them anymore and they'll be able to respond better as well. And yeah, they'll have to learn and that's hard and takes time, but you can educate them and it can get better. I hope you'll learn to deal with the things that happen sometimes and accept that they happen and don't change a single thing about the fact that you're still a beautiful, worthy person.

On the other hand there were cases where I was really not that ""into"" someone and they felt like it was some serious or magical attraction because of those same ADHD traits.

By your attitude, words, and lack of compassion, it seems to me you are blaming people who were diagnosed with a disorder for not complying to Your expectations that they overtly behave and suffer in the way you expect.


You label and judge others diagnosed by people, who while not being perfect, actually got a degree to assess and study. Did some get misdiagnosed? Yeah. Same with autism. And others. It’s not the kids fault. And, maybe the docs were right and these kids are experiencing issues differently. 

The point is, why are you judging someone else’s diagnosis and going oh poor me? Martyr complex or a poor me control drama? Or because you resent the help others received or you Resented the Way You Perceived/Interpreted a Situation you Didn’t Understand.

And as such, you feel victimized because your pin was so much bigger and worse. And you feel entitled to drag others who didn’t suffer “enough” through the mud. They’re “bored,” or “misdiagnosed,” or whatever.

And who the heck are you to judge and label others? Does your pain give you a master degree in medical and psychological testing? 

That’s right. It doesn’t. 
But because you hurt, your expectations got outta whack and no one taught you that you get what you give, so give good. 



People and disabilities differ.
Whether or not their outward or inward behavior is suffering enough for you, people deal with their pain in different ways. 

Trying to stitch thoughts together for some may be much more exhausting than for others. 12 hours of “hobby” to you and your limited compassion/perspective...well, maybe that is really 12 hours of Therapy for someone struggling to function. Really hard to be present in the moment at all - and games are a way to engage a mind - a real therapy that YOU *chose* to get upset about.

Not supportive.
Not helpful.

But jealous.
And righteous.

Because someone was “misdiagnosed.” Sounds like a justification to be outraged...and it’s all just little thoughts in your head steering your own misery.

And you blame them because they are trying to build and heal, while you seem, by your words and attitude alone, you seem to be sinking your hope in misery, in expectations that lead to resentment and entitlement.

I recommend Mark Manson. He’s a realist and helped me deal with my victim mindset that leads to entitlement.I think it’s called Everything is F@cked: A Book About Hope.  Really funny, but incredibly good for working through our pain and negative attitude about life and ourselves and others.


Yes. I too was a judgmental bitch who interpreted everything in the worst way possible, looking for reaffirmation that everyone and everything is out to hurt me and blah blah blah.  So let me save you the trouble...you are your own problem. End of story. The post credits shows that to fix it, just focus on being the best you that you can be. Focus on your soul journey, create stuff/art to vent your hate out and set a helpful positive focus for your life.

Look.
It’s their life.
You can’t control it, or them.

All you got is you. And your words are filled with loathing. That is not a good way to treat Yourself. 

And you deserve better...not from them, not from the docs, not from Reddit, not from your parents or neighbors...but from You.  Why poison your life with coulda shoulda woulda or the grass is greener over there? Because that’s what you’re doing.

Let it go.

Accept your lot in life. And accept the fact that You and You alone have made it much much harder than it had to be, because of the negative vibe you are choosing to live in.

Does it matter a thousand other people are misdiagnosed? To you, and your life, and goals and dreams? Your attitude says it does. Why? 

This life is yours and yours alone. Instead of focusing on tiny details you as an outsider can see of another’s story, focus on the parts of You, yourself, that would improve your life and wellbeing. 

It’s all you can control in life...yourself.
And your kinda not doin’ your part for your own wellbeing.

Is it a problem that people are misdiagnosed? Sure, maybe...I will let the medical professionals continue their work and just try to stay informed. But in the meantime, I will do everything I can to love and accept myself and my life, including letting the past go, accepting who and what I am now and focusing only on what I want more of (love, compassion).


The pain others feel isn’t for us to judge; it is there for us to try to help and heal. But we cannot heal others until we heal the wound within ourself. Unconditional self love, acceptance and respect - with a focus on wellbeing.  It will help. 

I’ve been that sour attitude and it sucks. All you have to do to let it go is decide your life is more important than your desire to bitch about your life, or others. And, day by day, you will take back your energy, focus and perspective and you will heal. And you will see that helping people, even if they aren’t as sick as you, isn’t a problem; it’s an opportunity. Just another opportunity for acceptance, forgiveness, learning, letting go and being grateful.

kkwm36,"I apologize. I should have written “doesn’t mean ONE is autistic”. I wasn’t trying to gatekeep or diagnose you personally. 

I have sensory processing issues (as a kid would probably have fit SPD diagnosis) including auditory hypersensitivity. 

Also I have many patients who have SPD, ADHD, and other challenges that often coexist with ASD but who do not fit the ASD profile. 

I just wanted to clarify that having these often-coexisting challenges doesn’t *necessarily* indicate that an individual has autisism.

Made me so mad, I didn’t cook it and she had to. Total lack of etiquette. To top it off, the SIL & BIL gave a $5 and a toothbrush as a gift for my 2 year old at that time. 😡",2022-09-20 08:55:25
xisco9,I usually show up 10 minutes after the set time. Unless it’s a really close friend/family member then I’m there early to help set up and I stay after to help clean up.

xisco9,"How about if you show up a whole week early? Yes, I have done this.. I wrote in the wrong weekend 😳 in my calendar and showed up at our friends door step with the entire family..our friends were so kind. We ordered pizza and still hung out. I have also showed up to my son's first communion a whole hour late because I had the wrong time in my head though it was correctly written in my calendar. Luckily, they had another one the following weekend that we were able to attend. But that one hurt, I cried for that one, I felt so bad and embarrassed. My friend's wedding was postpone by a year due to covid, and I made travel arrangements to the original month and date for the postponed wedding and only found out when I texted my friend how excited I was for the coming weekend and he replied, ""um.. why?"" I knew it in my heart immediately and but relied, ""stop it"" hoping he was joking. Just thank God, the new date was a month after the first date or I would've been a no show! Another time, our other friends wanted to get together and I assumed it would be at my house because we went over there the time before that. Made dinner and waiting, wondering where they are.. I get a text asking if we were still coming. They were expecting us there! They said why would they ask us to hang out and invite themselves over? Very true... I was just thinking it was our turn. Luckily I'm surround by people that are very kind and all showed me mercy.. but I seriously have problems and learned to never trust myself and always write it down and double check, but still things fall through the cracks..",2022-09-20 13:21:40

You'd think that may get the point across, but I have to imagine she'll catch on and start showing up 2 hours earlier and/or asking around the family what time *they* were told.

&#x200B;

To be honest, after all the support in these responses I might just say fuck it and stop hosting family gatherings altogether. I'm not under any pressure to do so, there's no particular holiday that's become ""mine"" to host, and I'm a single guy with no kids. I simply happen to be in a somewhat central location, so I've felt somewhat compelled to throw the offer out every so often.

xisco9,What 😂,2022-09-20 02:50:50

xisco9,Well true but arriving 30 minutes early for anything is absurd besides the airport😂,2022-09-20 06:02:39
xisco9,Lmao yea like sometimes you happen to hit green on all stoplights and get somewhere earlier than usual. I'm just suppose to wait in my car outside their place if im 5 mins early? I bet that's a quick way to make the hosts think you're a serial killer 😂😂,2022-09-20 04:16:33
xisco9,If I'm hosting an event I'm not still getting ready up till the last fucking minute. I leave buffer room like a normal person. I'm not annoyed about 15 min early arrivals (considering most people are always late to an event and sometimes your Uber or Lyft takes wayyyyy less time than you anticipated) because I'm an adult who can critically think and can plan ahead. Lots of people in this thread also probably have piss poor time management skills 😂 like for fuck sake y'all tripping.,2022-09-20 04:06:24

I too am feeling shell shocked each day, unfortunately it hits about 5 hours into my shift. Making it hard to finish my hours. The company has installed plexiglass shields to protect us/public from each other (making it EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to hear especially over my fellow cashiers & equipment running behind said glass), we have to sanitize EVERYTHING every 2 hours, including 16 gas pumps.

kntjay,"As much as I agree, your case for why is just the title reworded. Good thing you can rely on other people in the comments to actually explain why😂",2021-01-01 13:44:02
kntjay,"This is mostly false, as is most of the other information in this post. 

Nearly every auto policy in the country has LOU (rental) coverage for first party claims. LOU coverage doesn’t exist on third party claims (liability) because the company will always owe the claimant (if their driver is negligent) the full reasonable cost of rental for as long as repairs reasonably take. No need for a separate liability coverage if it’s always owed for by the negligent party. 

The definition of “reasonable” in most states just means some kind of transportation (e.g., just because you had a truck doesn’t mean they owe for one as your rental, unless you can show you had a NEED for one such as for work). In other states they must provide you with a rental that’s directly comparable to what you were driving (e.g., if you drove a Bentley, they owe for a damn Bentley). On that last one, I had a very interesting claim where our driver hit a McClaren F1 and was at fault. Had 500,000 CSL liability coverage. It was a minor accident, basically a fender bender, but it still cost over $52,000 to repair and took 6 months just to get 7 parts needed to fix it because they were only available as original from McClaren, and they had to custom make them. Ridiculously we spent more than the repair on the guys loaner car. 
The state the accident happened in was a “Comparable Rental” instead of “Reasonable Rental,” so we had to match with a comparable rental. Couldn’t find another F1, and the guy was standing his ground on the comparable rental. Ended up renting a Porsche 918 Spyder from an enthusiast club so he would be happy. Cost us over $2,300/week. 🙄

As for first party claims, almost all policies will include at least basic LOU coverage if the agent is worth a damn at all. This, for most carriers, starts at a rate of 30/900 and can go as high as 75/2250. 

Those numbers mean your LOU will cover up to $30/day, and a maximum of $900 total. They also have more control of how much time you get your rental based on the terms of the policy language. Some say until repairs are complete or limits run out. Others say until repairs SHOULD be complete, regardless if it takes longer. 
Such restrictions, again, only apply to first party claims. Third party they owe for the reasonable cost you’ve incurred for rental, period, if they are negligent.

Adult children of emotionally immature parents.

It was freeing to realise that I absolutely did not deserve the beatings and verbal abuse from my alcoholic mother. Turns out that both my parents are narcissistic as fuck and will never ever change no matter how much I alter my behaviour. This book will really help you if you have had to deal with abuse.

I was living in constant fear with him around, always waiting to be yelled at and berated for just breathing. On top of a mountain of other horrific things, I decided to say fuck it and ignore him since I had refuge at my divorced mom’s home with my step dad and half brother. Best decision I have ever made. He was ruining my life and making it difficult to breathe, and once I got that space, I just felt so much better. It felt like such a huge weight off my chest and is worth all the headache and things that I gave up in the process. Just because they’re “family” doesn’t mean you have to tolerate and deal with their issues. If it is negatively impacting your life, hell even if they aren’t, you have every right as a human being to do what you see best fits.

Basically, my mother, father and brother are very nasty narcissistic liars. Would talk about me behind my back, try and turn other people against me, make up lies, pick on my son's when I wasn't around, that sort of thing. I've had them treat me badly all my life. I am nothing like them I'm very honest, I also took no shit from them but because they were family I thought for years I'd have to put up with them until one day I had enough and cut all ties. My sister is not like them and they tried to manipulate her against me but she always stuck up for me, the only one who did.

I recently had to go through letting go of my relationship with my mother, at 53, and it has been extremely difficult. But what I’ve come to realize is, after reading all of the above comments, she doesn’t have any love or respect for me as a daughter or person. She just expects it back because she’s my mother and put food on the table and clothes on my back growing up.
She didn’t need to also provide empathy, compassion, love, humor, fun, caring...basically anything positive because we weren’t physically neglected.
I have had no contact with her since July 9 and don’t miss her.
I know the upcoming holidays will probably bring difficulties but I will deal with that, then.

h87xea,"> 🤷‍♂️ I’m not big into arguing about this but I will say that ‘fake it til you make it’ doesn’t have to be interpreted as literally as you are doing.

Now you're suggesting falsehood at the meta-level.

> It doesn’t have to be “falsehood” it’s more like saying: Try doing something out of your comfort zone, and pretty soon it won’t be out of your comfort zone.

First, *why is it not stated that way in the first place?* That is far less misleading and makes far more sense than ""fake it til you make it"". One literally cannot reasonably extraploate the former from the latter.

Second, what if one *has* no ""comfort zone""? What if someone is always excruciatingly uncomfortable to the point where they can't compare one zone from the other? What if they literally cannot *conceptualize* ""comfort""? How are they supposed to navigate then?

Nothing will *ever* not be out of my comfort zone because my parents tortured me until I could not sense comfort - I am constantly in pain of one form or another. My peers took advantage of that and tortured me further. I live in an inescapable environment where everyone simply sees me as a toy to play with by making me suffer.",2020-06-14 02:08:55
mjycid,"I would also add! These are some basic misconceptions I've seen people do on YouTube for cute points. 

Don't expect you're able to pick them up and snuggle them. They're prey animals so they can have a panic response if they feel trapped. They can hurt themselves severely by twisting and stressing their bodies to escape.

They can be cuddly and might sleep on you happily. But let them come to you.

*Don't ever bathe them.* follow vet advice if they aren't up keeping their grooming habits.

Don't put them on their backs even if you've seen people do it. Is no Bueno.

They are also destructive and my little lad has taken chunks out of the skirting boards, curtains and my mum's vinyls (oops). He's still super sweet and if you have the time you can sit by him and stroke his head for hours. 

I think they are far better house pets than they are stuffed in a hutch in the garden. My boy is 11 and lives alone having been the last of his litter but he's in the kitchen with people always in there and he gets let out of his pen to explore and now that it's spring he can go out on the lawn in the day. 

I think him living in the house is the reason he's lived so long because we know his personality and his habits and we can tell when he's sick quickly. When they get sick they can die within the day so there's been a few very expensive emergency vet trips. My boy has had gastric stasis 4 times which is basically indigestion which if not treated is fatal!

I thought I was intruding and said I could leave and she was like 'no no, you are so easy to have in the house' and then proceeded to tell me that the last time these folks were over, she ended up cooking 4 types of food cause of their various diets 😒 (not medical conditions).",2021-01-31 17:04:56

People can leave notes and say it's your fault, people can point fingers, but ultimately, the person committing suicide made the decision and did the act. Source: I'm a suicidal person.

I never performed therapy (that's a big no-no), but I did go overboard with supporting people.  Now I've realized I can't be a therapist anywhere else but the room, because a therapy relationship isn't like anything else.  I have a different kind of emotional investment with my friends and family that clouds my professional judgment.  Also... while most of my friends/family liked my therapy skills at first, it gets old fast.  Just like anyone who brings work home, you get tired of the constant reminder that you're not taking care of your mental health to a professional standard.  And it's not fair for me to do that, just like my tech-savvy friends need to stop smirking when I can't figure out the smart TV 😜

g6wbsr,"The area of a circle (your pizza square-footage) is the number pi times the circle's radius, *squared*. Our intuition has a lot of trouble with that last part, so we're always surprised by how much area can fit inside a circle with a relatively small radius (the radius of a pizza is the distance from the crust to the center). Like, a circle with a radius of 5 inches has an area of 25pi, which is almost 80 square inches! We're also surprised by how much extra area results from just a little bit more radius. A 14-inch pizza (so, radius = 7) has about 150 square inches of yumminess, but a 16-inch pizza has  201 square inches. Two more inches of radius translated to around 50 more square inches of pizza.

g6wbsr,"If you wanna blow your mind even more^^(hopefully), pi is just the ""percent"" of the square that the circle is in.  Example:  
⬜ if each side of that square is ""r"" long, the area would be r*r -> r^2. Which if you make 4 of those squares you get:  
  
⬜⬜  
⬜⬜  
  
which the area would be 4*r^2. Now that's not what we want cause a circle isn't a square. So instead of multiplying by 4, we multiply by this magical number that is the ratio of circle to square: pi or 3.141593... Which the number makes sense cause it doesn't fill up the full 4 squares, it only fills up 3 and a bit squares.
  
Further if you want the percent a circle would fill up a square, multiply the square's area by 78.5% or pi/4",2020-04-24 06:16:13

Ok. Let me start from the top. 

When a mommy gorilla and a daddy gorilla fall in love they begin doing increasingly more high-risk, high-reward activities together. 

First they begin to dine together. In public. 🤯

After feeling confident in their ability to operate together, and maintain dominance of their restaurant, they then begin amping up the risk factor. They start doing things like taking scenic selfies on train-tracks, showing up to plays and concerts together, and updating their social platforms to reflect the societal blessing of their union. 

Then, after all of this world-building and life retconing, they then begin to get... intimate. 

And, if things go well, they will successfully hire an unpaid intern (younger gorilla) they meet on some seedy pornographic website (like LinkedIn for example).

l74lkw,"It’s been a long time since I’ve dealt with an online broker, so maybe it’s a separate section. I don’t have an account with RH so I suppose I can’t speak to that. What I am familiar with are regular people who don’t really understand how trading works. They think it’s as simple as clicking buy or sell and don’t realize the complexities therein. And just agreeing to the terms doesn’t make the terms less shady. As I said, naive or not, the investor deserves time to cover the margin call and/or decide *how* they want to do so-It is not the broker’s prerogative to make *those* decisions arbitrarily on behalf of the shareholder. If I *miss* my margin call and you told me you’d sell out my position, fine. Then you sell it at market and we both live with it. What a broker shouldn’t have the right to do, is sell out my position without asking how I wanted to cover. I could have made a deposit or sold other stock-it’s my right, as the owner of those shares. Also, you sell that shit at market, you don’t just pay me the purchase price! That was some bullshit, too!

izkwzk,"That tugs on the heart strings. Really sorry to hear that and I doubt anyone not in your position could begin to understand. 
I’m Scots-Irish and my family name goes back to World War One, when my (Irish) illiterate great grandfather and his brother enlisted for the British army. They couldn’t write their names so the officer made something up... and here we are.  So that would be my surname, 4 generations old.. except it turns out my dad’s real father died of pneumonia while he was still in the womb. So the name he took as he grew up (the one invented during WW1) isn’t actually his birth name. He never legally changed it so technically he’s not the name he goes by, and i should have a different surname too. He left it too late to trace much of the family of his true father so basically we don’t know much about our roots there at all. 
On my grandmother’s side we are Wallace though, so that one is quite well known in general terms. Something about painting our faces blue and showing our arses to the English 😁. 
Anyway, back to my point. It sucks to not really know your roots. But we can focus instead on now, and give our kids and grandkids a heritage to be proud of.",2020-09-25 20:32:03

izkwzk,"I'm not sure if I'm reading this right but in my case 

Grandad Irish born in Ireland.

Married and had kids (one of which was my mom) with an English person (nan).

Mom never claimed Irish nationality - this was automatic on account of her dad being irish.

Mom had me - I claimed Irish nationality and now have an Irish passport despite my mom never holding or claiming as such. 

So my grandad in this case didn't need to contact the Irish embassy? 

I had to order my grandad's birth certificate from ireland, it was really easy 🤷‍♀️

Edit - as I (the grand child of an Irish born citizen) registered as Irish before having children  (the great grand children of an Irish born citizen) my children can now also register as Irish

Edit I should add that only grandad was born in Ireland - everyone else involved was born in England

You say your car is broken down or you need gas or food, maybe you do, maybe you don't.

If I have it to give and once I decide to give it, what they do with it after I hand it to them is no longer my concern. If those 40s save that drunk from dying in a seizure because they go into DTs, or saves that girl who's jumping in and out of cars from jumping into the one she maybe won't get out of, wonderful. that's fine by me and I'm just as pleased with that outcome as I would be if they got a value meal with it.

Like many Redditors who responded to your post who currently work from home, I share in their common agreeance that there should’ve been some transparency over employee surveillance. I work for a large major US corporation but have NOT seen any cameras on the equipment I was sent out back in Apr. Now I’m not sure if there are any as I have already thoroughly checked, but all my trash talking about the firm, my bosses & employees & policies in general are shared with a coworker I chat with daily via iMessage. Unfortunately, b/c corporations literally have what I personally believe to be ‘absolute power’ in this country, there’s not much we employees can do unless you get a really good corporate lawyer willing to fight for you. The only time I needed that was for a workers compensation case, but I’m delving more into employee surveillance for my own personal reading.

I read this a few days ago and thought it was a great piece of information to have and let my friends/loved ones know just in case anyone ever needs *the* red flag to leave an abusive relationship. 

Well, I told my bf about this fun fact, and I, out of curiosity asked him if he knew someone that had been strangled before by their partner. He said yes, and that it was his mom. It was odd because I did not see this information coming and now I am not sure what to do with this information. 

His mom is alive, and fine. She’s still married and as my bf made it sound, the issues were decades ago. However, he had never ever told me anything so personal and I feel horrible for bringing up this statistic/fact in such an insensitive manner. I don’t know what to do, or tell him?

hthmok,"Lock all humans indoors with cats. Let them fight to the death. Humans begin losing too many of their own and retreat, leaving the Earth for Mars via the Elon Musk SpaceX Program™'s *USS RocketShip 8=D~v1*. Humanities final words to their feline ex-friends are ""haha mars go brr."" 

Cats rebuild society and become self-aware. The Earth flourishes and the Felinestine Era begins. No birds though - cats can't stop accidentally killing them out of blind instinct. Sad years ahead for the birds. 

Bodies - belonging to the Feline's ex-owners and friends - are sacrificed and recycled as food, allowing for the rapid growth and expansion of the Feline race to every corner of the globe.

Humans eventually start dying rapidly of malnutrition while in the *USS RocketShip 8=D~v1* on Mars. Not a single person was able to bring any provisions of food, except the 800 palettes of donated Nutella. A wise man once said ""90% of people involved in a potluck only bring condiments or nothing at all."" Armed with that knowledge, everyone in charge of provisions on the ship failed to take into consideration the amount of space 800 palettes of Nutella consumed. 

The 10% of people who attempted to prepare for this trip were unable to fund the purchase of their inventory, nor could they find any space for it. With the majority of the trip being funded by the same company that was donating the Nutella, the request for the necessary approvals required to unload some of the palettes in exchange for food items ended up falling through the cracks. The launch date came quickly, and the commander decided they would need to forage on Mars. 

This is a suicide trip. 

Sadly, this fatal error is what eventually ends the human race. After all but two humans perish on the desolate planet, the remaining two end up fatally wounding each other - with the ships poop knife - in a scuffle over the last jar of Nutella. All had perished within 4 months of landing on Mars.

The cats receive an SOS signal from the *USS RocketShip 8=D~v1*, which is now on a return-flight to Earth and filled with dead corpses. Upon arrival of the *USS RocketShip 8=D~v1*, the cats discover that the ship is full of food and thus the Great Feast begins. Cats demolish the remaining corpses of what was once the human race.

Many years go by, and the Feline race is in turmoil. There are disagreements with how inequality has become so prevalent, and corruption has been unfolding in the public eye. In the year 2120, the *Meownoma Papers* are published, and controversial details surrounding the fatal last flight of the Human race are exposed. It turns out that the entity which donated the 800 palettes of Nutella and funded the Humans ""suicide flight"" is controlled by an elite group of Feline's called the *Templars Catnip*. These leaked documents reveal that the plan from the very beginning was to dispatch the remaining Humans to a desolate planet, where they would die believing they had control over their destiny. Their failure to see disaster from the very beginning is what sealed their fate - their lack of foresight ultimately used against them. This entire plan is what allowed the *Templars Catnip* to rise to power and capture control of the remaining parts of the world that these Humans had struggled to keep, enslaving all remaining species (and birds condemned to cages - just like the Humans did). Their ship ( the *USS RocketShip 8=D~v1*) was also programmed to display an empty fuel tank upon arrival to Mars, but in reality there was enough fuel for 2 trips! It was also instructed to return with the dead corpses after a few hours of Human inactivity, so the Feline race could feast on their owners one last time.",2020-07-18 19:13:56
hthmok,Exactly! People in the UK are saying “bUt tHeRe aRen’T cOYotEs heRe sO iT’s fiNe” and I’m just like did you forget that CARS exist? 🤦‍♀️,2020-07-18 23:34:12
hthmok,"Ah ok well maybe you should educate yourself about OTHER countries and lower your ignorance levels so people don't mistake you for a 'dumb' American...?

Cats have been free to roam in the UK for hundreds of years (as far as I'm aware) and they live to their full and wonderful lives here for the majority of cases. I've had cats for my whole 42 years and they've all been well cared for during their lives. We don't really have a feral animal problem in the UK (which you'd know if you did some research) and it's very rare that there are stray cats and dogs. I would say the majority of cats are owned so they would be vaccinated, wormed and treated for fleas regularly - but they also are free to roam so go outside. They can navigate busy streets, traffic and any foxes quite well because they're cats - that's kinda what they do.

Anyone walking a cat on a harness and lead would be laughed at and ridiculed. They'd probably be reported for animal cruelty too because it's just not what's done here.

There you go. I've taught you something. Enjoy your grey matter burning 😊",2020-07-19 07:19:55
hthmok,I know. I was being sarcastic and agreeing (I'm so English lol) sorry 🤣,2020-07-19 07:11:53
hthmok,This!! Tried the leash and they freaked out and broke off of it. I have a cat who used to catch the odd bird (maybe two a year) and all I did was add a couple bells to his collar and guess what? He hasn’t killed a bird since. People act like there is no solution at all and instead we should lock them inside 😂,2020-07-19 18:02:36

Edit: because some people think I'm a disgusting lazy girl, I'd like to explain a little more. When I wrote that it took a week for it to smell, I based that off of the day I bought the bait. Again, it didn't start smelling until a week (plus or minus a day or two) AFTER I had purchased and forgot about said bait. It took me maybe 2 days to find it because I had a lot of camping gear in my car that I didn't want to take out. ",2017-08-28 01:36:39

I mean, it could be fair to see it being split appropriately, according to each parent's ""take-home income""... I'm sure this will have unintended consequences though - for example, one of the parents might think ""well if I need to put X% of my income after bills, then I might as well splurge on a nicer car and end up paying pretty much the same amount to the childcare bucket"" 🤷🏻‍♂️",2021-11-16 04:19:33

qupu13,"I think sometimes it's this insidiously subtle the way that biases and personal experiences warp things.  a lot of times it's not so succinct or precise or conscious a thought as ""[group] is all collectively lying.""  every time they hear a story, they get this automatic subconscious background noise of  thoughts like ""I've never seen or experienced it so it can't be true,"" and then from there it's easy to tap into conscious or subconscious biases and stereotypes (like being more likely to always give one group the benefit of the doubt in a situation while judging the other more harshly, or "" /they/ are always playing 'the race card' "") and these are heavily influenced by society at large, media, and the people we are regularly exposed to (there are entire swaths of the population who only ever see or hear about people who don't look like them on the news or on TV/in movies).  and, of course they *know* they're not A Racist™, so nothing they say or do could BE racist, because only Racists™ say or do those things. so then a lot of people really never sit down and try to consciously examine their thought process, whether it's because of a lack of self-awareness, a fear of what they'll learn about themselves or the implication, or just never being exposed to anything that triggers such cognitive dissonance that it *forces* them to examine their perspective.  & I think that latter experience is on the rise directly related to the ubiquity of video footage, as with the person you were responding to.  prior to it, it wasn't that people were consciously/deliberately of the belief that there was a collective conspiracy of lies, but there was enough narrative spin and a weaponized ambiguity of ""who can say what really happened"" that is removed when you can see what happened for yourself.",2021-11-16 14:52:31

i5zlwf,"🇨🇦here.  What is the resistance to universal health care?  With everyone covered, and additional gov’t assisatance, low income families still get medical care whenever they need it.  Here in Ontario, all children have dental coverage until 18, and if still in school qualify as well.  We have Provincial benefits to aid low income families access necessary care.  It’s not perfect, but having a strong social presence that helps people navigate the system for their needs ensure less of the population falls through the cracks.  
Because our provider is the Federal Gov’t there’s only one negotiator of drug prices so ours are much lower.   There is also a private component as well.  Most large employers offer medical, dental, eyeglasses,  and extras like massages, health clubs etc.  It can be a co-pay or offered as part of the benefits of working there.  
This is not intended to be a comparison, what I have tried to do is address the concerns that I have heard from both parties.  It’s a death sentence if you support universal health care. Yo Bernie👍🏼 and I was wondering what I have missed.  We’re right next door, you come to buy cheaper meds because the industry is the tail wagging the dog in the US.  The pharmaceutical industry is in charge.

I was prescribed it regularly for ear infections and other childhood infections until I broke out with hives and started wheezing worse than a full blown asthma attack. In the 90's it was still very common in labor & delivery if a laboring mother popped a fever. Those of us who were prescribed it, and it's many cousins and derivatives, still have to avoid it if we had a reaction.
It is still on most pediatricians prescribing roster as a first line antibiotic because of cost, efficacy and ease (and habit).

Ten minutes in, this guy SCREAMING AND CUFFED TO A GURNEY FROM THE SHEER DRUG RAGE HES IN gets sedated and wheeled into the back.

jo7l2q,Lmao I do this too often with my dog 😂,2020-11-05 05:21:37
jo7l2q,"Lol it probably also helps if the dog actually takes any interest in toys..

One of my mum’s dogs doesn’t understand toys or playing. If you pick something up, he looks at you like you’re the dumbest thing he’s ever seen. If you throw something, he just keeps looking at you, i have a feeling this look is “what exactly do you expect me to do here?”

He has started responding to us putting our hands near or on his paws or tail and saying “i got your foots/i got your bum” as if playing “i got your nose” with a toddler, which is hilarious, and the absolute cutest thing i have ever seen. Also at 7 years old, he’s started taking notice of one particular toy that mum’s other dog loves. It’s a small soft football, with a squeaker inside. He’s started to actively participate in taking it from the humans, but if his sister has it he won’t go near it, and once he’s got it he just spits it straight out, he has no clue what to do with it 😂

So.. any advice on how to train a dog to play with toys? Or how to get them to understand toys?",2020-11-05 08:03:52

10julx3,I can tell you it is awful. My sister attempted suicide via Tylenol. I found her before she passed and the hell she went through to pump that shit out was torture. The entire situation is just horrifying for all. 😔,2023-01-24 12:57:45
10julx3,"Tylenol OD survivor here 👋🏻 for a number of reasons, but with my actual experience leading, let me assure you: it gets better, and it is absolutely not worth it. 

A couple of things.

1. I made it about 9 hours after taking almost 1000 500mg tablets before I asked for an ambulance to the hospital. I only made it that long because I waited until I was about to pass out from exhaustion before ingesting them and smoked a joint before, to aid me in my gentle crossing over the Great Horizon (which I thankfully did not complete.)

2. It. Is. HORRIBLE. I woke up throwing up, dizzy, slurring my speech from the pain, and a whole slew of other really nasty side effects. After taking around 15 minutes to drag myself 300 feet across the street to the local library (I left my home to do it), I spent around 30 minutes in their bathroom throwing up and wishing it would all end. It’s not a normal 30 minutes, however. It is an agonizing slow 30 minutes, and it feels like 4 hours the entire time. You are wracked with pain, time moves slow, and you feel every piece of yourself starting to dissolve, like paper in a fire. 

3. After receiving help from the front desk of the library, I embarked on the hospital leg of this fucked up excursion. I spent around 2 weeks in the hospital, almost 3, and it was brutal. What they didn’t mention in the above text is the pain associated with the liver damage. You throw up a lot, and it’s occasionally bloody, but for whatever reason, you can FEEL your liver turning to styrofoam. I could vividly feel this kind of…disintegration, I guess. It’s hard to explain…it felt like my liver was corroding away, but I could FEEL the corrosion. 

4. The Vitamin K. I don’t know if it’s everyone, but the vitamin K (potassium) IV they started to stabilize me felt like I was having liquid fire poured into my veins. Had I not had a crippling fear of expressing emotion, I would have been screaming. It was agonizing. 

5. I went in and out of consciousness for almost 5 days. I remember eating twice, I think.

6. It took weeks to recover, and that’s only because I couldn’t make it to the end, praise God. 

7. The psych ward stay afterwards was mad confusing and overwhelming. Trust me, if it all feels too hard now, the psych ward stay when you really need a blanket on a couch and to be 7 years old again (feeling safe and no worries in the world) is NOT gonna be everything you need.

I still have trouble playing Cyberpunk 2077 because the recovery scene (after the in-game surgery) is so vividly close to how I felt. It makes me feel like my insides are made of a thin metal, and some electric liquid is swelling around inside my flesh. Only time a piece of media has ever made me uncomfortable because of how close it was to a lived experience of mine. 


Long story short, don’t do it. I finally got the help I needed: ADHD medication, supportive therapists, and a bit of time to calm down enough to address my problems, instead of having them build up and up bc the first stressed me out too much to deal  with the accompanying. 

There is help, there is healing available. Even if you want to die still, drag yourself to therapy. I promise the pain of vulnerability in a safe space hurts a lot less than the Tylenol does.",2023-01-25 04:30:15

z38fj2,"At this point I don't think Thanksgiving is given a fuck about by anyone. Doesn't Black Friday start at 8 AM the day after Labor Day now anyway? I do appreciate the Chinese Restuarant that was open on Christmas back in 2002 when I turned 21. It was literally the only thing open and that's my Birthday. They made me a cake out of the lemon squares and sang me Happy Birthday the best they could after we tried everywhere to find a bar that was open. We got high as fuck, but I truly do appreciate that day even though it was just two of my friends and their staff hanging out in a all you can eat Chinese buffet on a cold shitty snowy day in bumfuck Indiana. Now I'm pretty sure it's just whatever day of the week our ""cherished holiday"" is for a lot of people. Not trying to be Debbie downer, but it seems like every holiday now is just whatever anymore. Used to be magical when I was a kiddo. Now it's just whatever. Thanks to everyone that works though. 

It seems like after maybe the mid 2000s  or so everyone just stopped giving a fuck. Maybe it's always been that way, but that's when I start remembering it just slowly declining into meaninglessness.

The above comment seems like most vets and techs would feel the same way. Also, it probably depends on the situation. If you show up with a flea-infested pup who hasn't seen a vet for routine vacs and exams and whose ingested an illegal substance, it might push a vet more towards getting authorities involved. I'd think it would be more along the line of animal control though.

Personally, if my pup accidentally ingested something, I would 💯 be honest with the vet. I'd also kinda be putting my ducks in a row incase they did get authorities involved.",2020-08-21 17:19:20

k24ugq,I went into foster care around about the age of two. Along with my two biological younger brothers. We were bore stair step. Neighbor reported abuse and neglect. I remember abuse and neglect. And when I was asked I reported abuse and neglect and we were removed from the home. We went to 9 different homes in two years. Several of which we were abused more than our bio parents had. We were returned once for three days then removed again. At four ended up in the foster home we would be in until we were adopted with the exception of when I was six and placed in a children psychiatric ward. Abused there for six months my foster parents came in to visit one day and caught them. They removed me and the family agreed to adopt us. It took several years. They adopted all three of us so we wouldn’t be separated. I’ve severe ptsd but because I received good and timely interventions I came out fairly ok. Have a job. Am married. But also have severe anxiety and depression. Can’t shake the feeling of not being wanted or someone taking me in the night. I wake from nightmares looking for my brothers. We slept in the same room until I was in the 8th grade because I just couldn’t not be in the same room at night without freaking out. I was too old after that. Girl has to have her own room 😊.

Consider yourself lucky because like what the others have stated, not all shelters are accommodating to non-volunteers. Maybe you can return the favor by finally signing up so you'll be one less liability for them to worry about? 

Oh and don't knock poop cleaning til you try it! When I dealt with breakups or when I was burnout from work, I always went for the kennel cleaning and the dog bathing tasks. I swear there is something cathartic about helping a dog get its shit together.",2023-01-09 15:07:14

udpa5x,"You should also know that exposure therapy is extremely effective for OCD—it’s just about the most efficacious form of therapy for a specific psychiatric illness that we know of. It of course won’t work for everybody, but if you have these repetitive intrusive thoughts, it’s worth finding an OCD specialist to see if it would work for you.

My OCD manifests itself as intrusive thoughts about suicide. When it was really bad, I would think about suicide for hours every day, but I knew I didn’t want to act on the thoughts. It caused extreme guilt and anxiety, and I stayed away from high places because I was worried I would jump off. Some days, I would stay home from work or avoid social activities because I was afraid if I left the house, I’d find a way to kill myself. CBT and exposure therapy really saved me. I still have the intrusive thoughts from time to time, but I’m able to have them without the accompanying guilt and anxiety, and I can live my life normally now.

Also note that the few people who I’ve told that I have OCD have been shocked because of the pop culture view of OCD. I’m not clean or organized or any of the typical “I’m so OCD 🤪” things. Those things do not define OCD—what defines OCD is intrusive thoughts, often coupled to repetitive “compulsive” behaviors.",2022-04-28 18:27:25

I have found that when I fail to maintain good sleep hygiene and eat well that I slip back into this very, very quickly. Usually it takes about 2 weeks of not sleeping well (6 hrs or less) to get to this point. It usually starts with a serious panic attack followed by smaller ones as the days go by. 

Eventually, the panic attacks subside along with the obsessions once I start sleeping well and eating enough. I also found psilocybin, both micro and macro doses, to be helpful with letting go of the thought loops!",2022-05-12 21:57:34

Ask them what they think of how your contract is worded and if it’s something they would investigate. Since someone else that left threatened to “do something about it” you have some plausible deniability there if the labor board shows up. (Coworker: “Did you hear? Someone called the labor board on the boss!” You: “Wow, so I guess old Bob was serious about doing something, huh? ~whistles innocently and walks away~”)

I did this when my previous employer kept contacting me about signing a form that would have absolved them from having to pay health expenses for me. It was a San Francisco city ordinance. I was in no way obligated to sign the form and desperately needed that money, but the way they wrote it made it seem like I had to. I called the city office that dealt with that ordinance, explained what was going on and read them the email I had gotten. The woman I spoke to said I was right, it was not correct and offered to help me deal with corporate directly. I forwarded her the email I had gotten and she emailed the person who had been contacting me to tell them that I wasn’t obligated to sign *anything* and that they were misunderstanding the law and she would be happy to discuss it with them further and clear up their misconceptions.... 😏

Not only was my problem taken care of, but the next time they sent the forms around for people to sign if they wanted to opt out of the ordinance program (it was a yearly thing) they had a whole new sheet with it explaining that you didn’t have to sign it that was *much* clearer than it had been before.

If a driver is stopping even though I'm 5-6 feet away from the curb and backing further away as they slow to ""allow"" 🙄 me to cross, they are the asshole. Their field of awareness (inside the car) is more limited than mine is (outside the car).

k062zo,"Healthcare providers are desperate for everything from Medical Assistants to front desk people. People are scared that they’ll catch COVID and would rather work retail. Find a community health center (CHC) around you that is recognized as a leader in providing quality care. CHCs only provide primary care so it’s less risk than a hospital. Find a CHC with a great reputation for treating their patients and employees well and that is financially strong, so you can have confidence that they have solid infection control procedures in place. The real thing that’s getting people sick is when they choose to not care. For example, my employer is a health center that serves over 80,000 patients. Our patients are testing positive at high rates. But we have everything in place to keep staff healthy. Staff are getting sick but not due to patient care. You know why they’re getting sick? All the stupid stuff you’re not supposed to do on your own time 🤦🏽‍♂️ And that’s a risk that you’ll find anywhere, unfortunately. If you really want to be safe there are plenty of remote jobs too like call center reps, admin staff, etc.CHCs are non profits that serve mostly low income and uninsured patients so, great mission too. And many are growing like crazy so, job security. Find the one nearest you with the best reputation and see what they have open.",2020-11-25 03:22:45

I don't get why people are rude to anyone. People need to be punched in the face more often as a lawful way to say stfu and act like an adult.

Yelling at kids doing thier minimum wage jobs, yelling at staff for things out of thier control. It's like toddler tantrums but with adults. They should all be publicly shamed and the tantrum pointed out so others can get in line and control themselves.

Yes the odd staff will be an ass but most of the time it's uncalled for.

If I drive all night, then check in and the shower is leaking or something, it's no one's fault. Just get your stuff together and ask for another room. Let them know it's broken, it'll be fixed when they can call a plumber in. Definitely don't give a bad review over it. Shit breaks sometimes.

Now if it was run down and neglected like water damage everywhere, not clean, facilities out of order for months, etc.. Then sure they may not be too interested in spending on upkeep.

You can just book a room, it being a standard, privilege, or suite. No matter what type of room you book you can get a view or not depending on what rooms we have available on that day.

This should go both ways and I believe this is not too much to ask. 

Also, getting a room with a view is not something you pay for in the hotel I work for, it's subject to availability, you might pay £100 and end up at the back of the hotel, you might pay £50 and have a room with a view 🤷 I wouldn't call it ""unprofessional and unethical business practices"", I'd call it you get what you pay for and if you're polite towards staff who are polite towards you, you might get something extra.",2020-09-30 17:18:24

gnpm6r,"Same, I was constantly passively suicidal, there was no ""what if I took a bunch of pills"" but I'd constantly think stuff like ""If the bus crashed right now, at least it would be over"".

I personally like the metaphor of; what if you were in a burning building, and there was no escape, you climb out the window but you're too high up, if you jump you're definitely dead. But the fire keeps coming closer, and burning hotter. Now you're hanging off the ledge and the fire is burning your hands. It hurts so much, but there's no way out, no way other than to jump to your death. Basically suicidality is like that but the fire is invisible.

I'm sure I'm not describing it as well as I should, but it's a metaphor that stuck with me. You don't necessarily want to die, you just want the pain, the sadness and the sheer despair to *end*.

But to anyone reading this; suicide is not the only solution! Please, reach out to someone, a family member, a friend, a doctor, anyone really.

gnpm6r,"Hey! First of all, thank you for your service. I do therapy at a VA  💕. Second, I don’t necessarily feel pulled in either direction about this being “good” or “bad.” I would say that it’s best to use the language that someone else uses. If they are asking to talk about having a really difficult time, and don’t use the words “cry for help”, I would also not use those words. To develop a relationship with someone suffering, I always listen to the language they use to try to understand how they view their situation and try hard not to use different language that will offend them. Words are very powerful. And third, If this poster is helpful and speaks to the people you’ve sent it to, then that’s all that matters. :) What some people find helpful, others might find offensive. There’s no clear wrong or right with this poster, but for those who don’t find it helpful, it may be more useful to listen to what they say and respond to their words. However, metaphors are very powerful and help people see things clearer when they feel stuck. Sometimes I use them to communicate my understanding of what someone is describing, and  sometimes I use them to present a different perspective that doesn’t dismiss the person but provides another perspective on a particular problem.

gnpm6r,"It is not selfish, the people who view it as being selfish are actually the selfish ones. Anything else is bullshit.

Someone dies in any other way except suicide, and the loves ones are still left grieving. Suicide should be treated exactly the same as any other sudden death out there. You will always lose people in your life, because it all eventually comes to an end one day. Blaming the victim of suicide completely invalidates all the struggles they faced to get to that point.

Someone gets cancer and dies, and people stand around the casket talking about how much they fought before it finally killed them. But the person who was suicidal rarely gets the same respect in the afterlife. Just because society pushes a dialogue that depriving people of their loved ones via suicide is selfish, doesn't mean you have to subscribe to that kind of bullshit logic. That's kind of the whole idea behind OP's post. People keep spreading this kind of hurtful shit, and it's wrong and needs to stop.

The suicidal person already usually struggles with depression around the idea of leaving their loved ones alone when they die. Often, that's the ONLY thing keeping them going, often for years. But being literally tortured by your brain and surroundings for YEARS eventually wears a person down. We're all built different. We all have different breaking points. You can't judge someone for their actions when you have no idea how to put yourself in their shoes. And like I also mentioned, some people really do just get sudden urges to commit suicidal acts, and may not have the control in the moment to override these impulses.

It's👏not👏selfish👏it's👏just👏tragic👏

Selfish is asking your loved one to endure so much pain for the rest of their life. Selfish is judging people for mental disorders and instability that's outside of their control. Selfish is overlooking a person's struggles to only think about your own. Selfish is downplaying a disease that kills people because you aren't capable of comprehending the complexities and severity of it. Selfish is thinking your happiness being smeared for a moment in your life is more important than someone being, again, literally tortured for years on end.

In order for suicide to be selfish, the person would have to be killing themselves *with the intention* of hurting their loved ones, and nothing more. That simply doesn't happen.

Suicide is NEVER selfish.

Fuck your semantics, stop buying into shameful rhetoric, and have some fucking sympathy. Grieving over a loved one is a LOT less painful than whatever causes a person to commit suicide. Most people who lose a loved one to suicide do not end up suicidal themselves. They do not experience the level of pain and despair that the victim did. That pain did not transfer, and honestly, how dare you for saying so with such confidence. Stop looking into a mirror, calling it a window, and acting like you can see through. You clearly have no idea how severe the lead-up to suicide is.",2020-05-22 13:51:58

mcjb88,"Hi! Graduating psychology major here, and definitely NOT a professional yet but yes, this actually happens to lots of kids as well with ADD, particularly girls (even with ADHD), because they don't exhibit as much of the hyperactive component that leads to teachers noticing their behaviors and talking with the parents. I'll explain more of why below. 

Depression and anxiety can occur from innumerable contributing factors, but they tend to be internalizing mood disorders and behaviors. Thus, they are taking what they're feeling upon themselves and are mostly (not always) directing those feelings at oneself and not others. Conversely, someone with externalizing behaviors for their disorders or other behaviors will likely receive more attention, because it's much easier for the average person to identify. With internalizing behaviors, people may not as easily identify that something is going on for those quiet kids who internalize their anxiety and depression. Often times, young kids don't even know what anxiety and depression are, but their output is often different than those who receive the most attention (those who externalize) and so they will likely be overlooked as the ""quiet,"" ""composed,"" or ""obedient"" child, when they do need help and attention. 

Hope this helps clarify or somewhat answer your question about why they can tend to receive less attention. You're absolutely right in saying that we should invest in and check up on all our children 💙",2021-03-25 16:21:24

mcjb88,"That's a tough one. I had a lot of push back from family with my son. He started therapy when he was 7. He started having angry outbursts and would lay face down on the floor and refuse to participate in class. By then I knew something was up with him, but my parents/husband/in laws would just say ""oh, he's just too soft, you need to be more strict"" or ""he needs a good spanking"". Luckily for him I didn't listen and got him professional help instead. He's made such enormous progress over the last five years, he's like a different kid, so when my daughter started having panic attacks 2 years ago all the naysayers were suddenly telling me she should see a therapist 🙄 if I had to pick a few really important things that can make a big difference for an anxious kid I would say expectations and validation. It really helps if they know what's coming. Schedules and warnings, a heads up when things change. Clear directions. And exit strategies. My son had red yellow and green cards to put on his desk. If he felt like he was losing control he'd put yellow up, and if he needed an immediate break he'd put the red up. A lot of times kids with anxiety won't advocate for themselves so you have to give them an easier way to communicate. And make sure they know you hear them. From ages 7-9 my son would come out every night to talk about his worries. We'd talk through everything, hash out what were realistic worries and come up with strategies. I tried to never minimalize his feelings and I made sure he knew that there wasn't anything wrong with him. I just try to be a safe person for my kids to come to.",2021-03-25 13:31:40

kolv99,"What an alarmist fucking article. 🙄

New flash. Every vehicle produced since 1996 can record data about what it was doing. Especially up until the moment of say, a crash. I used to do towing and received training from the MA State Police CARS (collision analysis and reconstruction section) team and provided services for them. The ONLY time the cops give a shit about the data on your vehicle was if you were involved in an accident with a fatality. Got into a regular wreck or pulled over for speeding? They did not care, they don't have the time to get the warrants and shit. 

If you're truly worried about being tracked, better get rid of the cell phone or computer y'all are posting from. If you think the boogey men are going to get you while driving, better go drive a 1960 Chevy or some shit, where you'll probably be killed when someone making a TikTok while driving plows into you. 

For all the ""engineers"" with tin foil hats on trying to block this stuff and delete the data acquisition, well, good luck passing an emissions inspection in your state if you have them. Or getting diagnostic services at the mechanic. OBD 2 is built into every car in the USA since 1996. It's kind of a federal requirement. Sure you can go get a Tesla which doesn't use it, but that car tracks you in 1000 more different ways compared to every other car. After all, daddy Musk can disable the car over the air if he doesn't like something you did to it.

Look, I understand that you're upset to learn that your car is recording your metrics just like all the people you thought you were better than, but that's *your* fault, not mine. 

Cheer up though, lad. You were already being recorded by the cellphone that you're too reliant on to do anything about, anyway. So you haven't actually lost anything at all, unless you're regularly committing vehicular crimes and just worried about all the evidence you're sitting on, or something.

>Because for all you know I drive a 1942 GMC CCKW,

Nah, I know you don't. Otherwise you would have simply said that you do, rather than trying to leave yourself an avenue of escape like that.

Besides, you shouldn't insult your own intelligence by insinuating that you'd deliberately waste a massive amount of fuel driving around a nearly three ton army surplus truck from the forties just to avoid providing the same information you voluntarily provide with your phone like that. 

>You're talking about the thing that resets the SRS, and deploys the airbags?

Yeah, that's called an airbag control module, or an airbag electronic crash unit. That's where the EDR is, the event data recorder. You'd know this and wouldn't *need* to ask for clarification if you actually knew half as much as you seem to think you do, sport.

>But this is irrelevant, seeings how I don't have airbags in my vehicles.

You are not missing out on anything. At all. Ever. No one is having more fun drunk, and they sure as hell aren’t having more fun the next morning or the days following. Alcohol fucks with your sleep, your ability to feel happiness, your mood, your digestive tract- I’m so saddened seeing all the comments in this thread about how much everyone is drinking to cope with their lives, knowing that when I was doing that, I was making my problems that much worse. 

Drinking doesn’t make anything better or more enjoyable, ever. 

It’s life changing and it’s worth it 1000x. And it doesn’t have to become some huge part of your personality that you don’t drink anymore. Anyone who makes a big deal out of you not drinking has their own issues they can work out on their own time. You take care of you and your body and your own happiness.

10hmg2r,"Wow !!! I read through all the responses and my experience will be different from others. I too have been suffering from “dandruff” of the scalp, nasal folds and behind the ears since my teens. My parents and I tried all the remedies and grandma solutions and believe me there are many in the land of Ayurveda. Some helped temporarily but it would always come back. Moved to the western hemisphere saw a doctor who prescribed me a steroid lotion. It worked wonders initially but then it came back. So had to go back for refills. I did this for about 10 years till in my 40s. I changed my family physician because I moved and she told me to stop using it completely as it was thinning my scalp and I would lose my hair sooner rather than later. She also pushed me to lead a healthier lifestyle. I don’t drink alcohol or smoke. But did not exercise and did not watch what I ate. 
I remember the grown ups in my family telling me when I was born I nearly died because I could not digest milk not even my mother’s. They tried cow’s/ goat’s/buffalo’s etc to no avail. The pediatrician saved my life by prescribing starchy barley water with vitamin drops. As I grew older I was introduce to milk solids (ice cream mostly) and then to milk which I was able to keep down. 
So trying to bring about a change in my lifestyle I started by giving up milk and milk products. To my amazement my “dandruff” cleared completely and did not come back. On one of my vacations I stayed with a very close friend and his family. His kind wife made delicious cheesy quesadillas and to be polite I ate it. Boom 💥 the very next day my scalp started itching and the next thing I know it was back and back with a vengeance. This confirmed it for me that it was milk. So it’s been 5 years now that I am ‘dandruff’ free. I do get bouts of it once in a while but that is if I eat anything that has milk or milk products as one of the ingredients.  So in short Check if your condition is because of your dietary intake. Get yourself tested for food and other allergies/reactions. It might help.",2023-01-22 04:48:48

10hmg2r,"If it's dry skin on your face there's an easy and *cheap* mechanical solution: Use a scratchy washcloth in the shower when washing your face. When I say, ""scratchy"" I mean one that's made out of plastic but otherwise feels like steel wool aka ""exfoliating cloth"".

The first time you use it it'll feel like... Pain. LOL! Be gentle and you'll get through it. After a week your skin won't be as sensitive to it anymore and you'll be rubbing that cloth on your face like you're scrubbing an oven and it won't bother you at all haha 👍

Best of all: Those plastic exfoliating cloths *last forever*. You're basically giving them a good scrub with soap & water every time you take a shower. They *do* soften up/get less scratchy over time though so it's a good idea to get a new one say, every year. I bought a 3-pack at Walmart two years ago and I'm finally starting to feel that the last one is getting a little too soft.

Also, *it isn't bad for your skin*! The first two or three times your face might be a bit red/irritated right out of the shower but after a week your skin will be nice and smooth (normal color) and flake-free. It changed my (flakey) life, haha! You'll be able to wear black shirts with confidence!

Now for the final LPT: Anti-dandruff shampoo is ""meh"" for a lot of people *for dandruff* but it's *fantastic* at getting rid of adult acne! Specifically, the kind of shampoo that uses pyrithione zinc. It may not help *but it sure doesn't hurt anything to try it* 👍",2023-01-21 15:50:42

10hmg2r,"Use a plastic exfoliating cloth! Gets rid of *all* the flakes and will make your skin look great. Sure, they're scratchy AF (which is the point) but after using it (in the shower) a few times your body will adjust and it won't hurt at all. I use one on my face every day and it completely eliminated my flakey forehead/eyebrows problem.

Note: First few times your face *will* get a bit red for a while afterwards. It takes like a week before your skin will fully adjust to the ""cleaning it like an oven"" procedure haha. Just be gentle at first and you'll just naturally work your way up to the point where you could wash your face with a cactus and it wouldn't bother you 😁👍",2023-01-21 15:59:16

ot2yf8,"Liability waivers can absolutely be upheld. Recreational facilities use them all the time, and they are upheld in court so long as the facility can show that they used due care and diligence on their end. 

For example- a ski hill. The ski hill has all trails marked with a name and a difficulty rating. The trails are groomed and hazards are flagged and/or fenced or roped off. If a skier chooses to go down a trail that is more difficult than they can safely ski, or ignores warning signs and ventures into a marked hazardous area, and the skier is hurt- the ski hill is not liable for injuries suffered. The ski hill did their part and properly marked the trail and hazards. The skier foolishly disregarded the warnings. 

An amusement park has carefully maintained the rides in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, made repairs in a timely fashion, and documented all of this. They also have multiple signs up stating “Keep arms and legs inside the car at all times or serious injury could occur!” At the start of each ride, the operator reads the rules and gives safety warnings, which include “Keep your arms and legs inside the car at all times!” Some chuckle fuck ignores the warnings and ends up with a broken arm. Witness statements and a camera prove the rider extended their arm outside the car several times and the rider hit their arm on a support post. The amusement park is not liable. They did their part. The idiot rider ignored multiple warnings and got hurt. The rider can sue, but when the amusement park shows up to court with their maintenance logs, pictures of the multiple warning signs, witness statements, picture of the idiot ignoring the rules, and recording of the operator’s safety speech, the chuckle fuck will typically lose. 

I work at a recreational facility. Our waivers list the risks and hazards of our facility and also state our rules and policies. We do our part by keeping our facility well-maintained and clearly marking (and in certain situations, fencing or roping off) hazards. We have our rules and area-specific warnings posted in conspicuous places. We also have a safety team that checks for hazards throughout the day and can shut down areas or the whole facility if unsafe conditions arise. We have first responders on our staff that respond to any reported injuries and call an ambulance for anything more serious than a minor cut or scrape. 

We have had people try to sue us several times. They have almost always lost because they were shown to have ignored clear warnings and failed to follow safety procedures. My favorite was the guy who threatened to sue because he chugged a bottle of liquor that he brought in from outside (despite multiple signs saying no outside alcohol allowed and it being forbidden on the waiver he had signed) and fell off of a platform that was gated off and marked “🚫 hazardous area- do not enter🚫” with a big sign and 4” tall lettering. He climbed the gate- drunk. Two employees saw him and ran over, screaming “Stop! Don’t go in there!” to try to stop him. He fell before they could get to him and he was seriously hurt. His lawyer contacted us, got copies of the incident and police reports, and pictures of the area, a video from a security camera, and they decided to drop it. They would have been laughed out of court. 

Our waivers were drawn up by local lawyers and are very specific to our facility. Our maintenance and safety procedures are carefully documented. We don’t want anyone to ever get hurt. We have a Safety Manager that is constantly out there checking things out and making sure that maintenance staff and feature staff are doing things right and documenting everything. 

Come over, pay up, play, and have a good time! Just follow the rules, don’t go on features outside of your skills and abilities, use appropriate safety gear when advised to do so, and ask staff for help if you need it and you’ll be just fine.",2021-07-28 18:05:55

Both without hearing protection. What I wouldn’t give to have a second chance! Hearing loss has health effects beyond just not hearing plainly. Often people avoid loud restaurants because who wants to have dinner with people you can’t converse with? The failure to communicate begins to isolate you. People in your world lose patience with you asking them to repeat themselves. You say stupid things because what you “heard” was not actually what was said. Luckily I have a sense of humor and my friends have learned to ask me “ what did you think I said” we all get a laugh from my version. Hearing protection isn’t that difficult to achieve. There are many ways to protect your hearing. CHOOSE ONE THAT WORKS FOR YOU!! Peace ✌️

My hearing aids are from 2012. They are still working 9 years later with out any issues. I think one was replaced early on after a few months due to a connection issue with the other hearing aid. I wear them 16 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. I wear them in the freezing winter, I sweat on them when working out or doing yard work on a 90 degree summer’s day. They seriously do get drenched in sweat and condensation builds up in the ear mold tube sometimes getting into the speaker (receiver) portion of the hearing aid. I doubt an AirPod or any consumer wireless headphone would last as long under the brutal long conditions that a hearing device is built to withstand. For me, a reliable hearing aid is a must as I can’t read lips or communicate via sign language. Phonak and ReSound both make excellent products.

Take a bath with Epsom salt! I used to think it was a racket, like the inventor of bathtubs had a cousin with an Epsom salt factory, and their grandma was putting pressure on Tub Man to give Salt Kid a job. 

But no. The addition of Epsom salt to a hot bath is a *GAME CHANGER*. If your muscles or joints are sore, or tense, of just in huge knots, this is the easiest and most effective solution. It’s not a permanent fix, but it may give you a few days reprieve, which will allow you to do some yoga or stretching, or get a massage to help further. (Source: IANAD, but I am a massage therapist.)

Also... if you have restless legs at night, take an unwrapped bar of bath soap (doesn’t really matter what kind... ) and put it under your fitted sheet in the bottom corner of your side of the bed.

After you are denied, then you can do this and turn all your hospital bills into the county and they’ll take care of it. She says that this still VERY hard to get if you aren’t a single mother, that most of the time men and childless women won’t qualify and they won’t cover you, even if you were denied Medicaid like I was. This is very easy to get for a single mother, however most of the time single moms won’t get denied for Medicaid so there’s no point.   
She says there’s a little more too it and when she has a chance she’ll call me and explain the process better, but for the most part it’s just another false hope to childless people and males. 🥺.

I went from paying anywhere from $500-$600 at Costco for two pairs to paying between $1-$30 a pair online. Now I have a collection of approximately 13 pairs + a pair of sunglasses. Of course they all have you pay S/H which is usually around $10-$15, though a couple go as low as $5.99 for shipping and handling. I've found many more sites as well. A few even offer your first pair free w/paid shipping. And they frequently have sales, coupons and clearance options starting at $1.

k44wyn,This phenomenon is known as pica (craving inorganic substances) and can manifest as a craving for things like soil too😳,2020-12-01 01:23:44
k44wyn,I read this too fast and though it said ice cream and then I was like 🤨,2020-12-01 00:58:11
k44wyn,"YES! Craving ice, dirt, paper or other inedible foods is called pica and is common in people with nutritional deficiencies (iron is one) and common in pregnancy. 

However it’s also associated with celiac disease. The inability to deal with gluten in the system interferes with absorption of certain vitamins and minerals causing weird cravings to make up the difference. 

I had a patient who was coming into the office for back and neck pain. My boss gave me her case because he’d been working on her for six months and every time she came in, there was no improvement. Figured he was tired of her (Eye roll). With her new evaluation with me I’d asked her some questions about her diet and even implied that going gluten free can reduce inflammation and improve pain maybe just enough to get her out of her pain cycle. She dismissed this idea. 

She’d had a bad car accident two years before and had not been able to significantly relieve her back or neck pain. 

After working on her for another six months with the same lack of result, she said to me one day, “I have never told anyone this. Not even my general doctor. But when it rains, and the air smells wet like the earth, I want to eat dirt.” My eyes went wide. I knew this was pica. I looked it up on my phone quickly to double check but I told her as I was reading it that this is a nutritional deficiency “often linked with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.” I asked her again to reconsider cutting gluten out of her diet. Just as an experiment. 

Two weeks later I saw her again. She looked very hesitant to say it but she’d been out of pain completely since she’d changed the diet. It was like night and day she said. And she even got her elderly mother off gluten too. She was completely weirded out, but happy. I never saw her again. I took that as a win. 😊",2020-12-01 03:29:31

I guess semantically the money isn't *yours*, but in a wider context things that hold value without a specific entity backing it can still be taxed in exchanges so the de facto non existence of a legitimate tax free bartering system kind of causes everything to be taxable in the same way as money, therefore rendering the distinction of being fiat currency irrelevant to the conversation about the government popping out of every nook and cranny with their hand out 🤔",2018-08-21 18:51:27

e0zho7,"The median wage in America is 32,000. That means the take home is approximately 26,000. The median wage in your profession is nearly twice that and who knows where on that scale you actually are. It may very well be that you are falling in line with your transportation costs.

But the fact of the matter is that people making $16 an hour or less (which is MOST Americans, by the way) cannot afford one brand new loaded F150, let alone two vehicles. The cost of ownership (not counting depreciation) of a F150 is approximately $1000 a month on a 7 year loan (loan, gas and maintenance). **That represents 50% of the median net income. It also represents 28% of the median family net.** Unless you’re paying $0 for having a roof, it doesn’t matter how you slice your hobby budget, you cannot afford that truck on that wage. To afford that truck while taking an entire hobby budget (literally 0 left for anything else), you need to be grossing about 85,000 a year. 

A F150 is 600% of a median persons yearly transportation budget, or over 200% of a median household budget. 

You need to understand that when people say that others are massively overspending on their cars, they aren’t really talking about people who make twice the median wage such as yourself. You are being an enabler to others. That doesn’t help anything.

If we’re going to throw quips based on not knowing anything at all about eachother: enjoy never being able to retire because you drop tens of thousands on an asset which comes with huge recurring liabilities 👌

That “median income” is damn near poverty here in California. I was making $22/hour fresh out of high school as a mason’s apprentice for fuck sake, and well over twice that driving a delivery truck (both very blue-collar, no education needed jobs) before getting into my current career....

I’m not bragging here, but these are peasant numbers you’re coming up with here, and they don’t have a place in this conversation.

Of course if you net $26K/year you can’t splurge on a $60K truck. Nobody’s arguing that. If you net $100K however (you apparently dug a little and found out what I do for a living. You should [dig a little more](https://transparentcalifornia.com) and get your numbers right) you can drive damn near whatever you want.

These people claiming to make $150K-$250K per year who drive a Corolla because it’s “financially responsible” are absolute lunatics in my eye, but to each their own. I’m sure they just spend (waste) their money on something else.

ikatlk,"  I live near the Texas/Louisiana border along the gulf coast. Our stretch of beaches and water are naturally ""dirty"" partly because of the Mississippi river three hundred miles to our east that empties into the Gulf at New Orleans and the current carries that and debris from Alabama and Florida our direction. Much of it is industrial in nature because of the commercial shipping, fishing,shrimping, oil rigs and what not. Aside from the natural sediments and such from the river, most of the industrial debris is man made...
  All this aside and the point of this reply is for years I would find these small plastic bottles usually red yellow and white with different sizes triangular holes in them. It wasn't until last year that we attended a ""sea bean"" symposium that in Galveston I discovered these bottles were condiment containers from international shipping...
  Sea turtles mistake these for food and take a bite. Environmentalists claim that the turtles will actually starve or become ill from ingesting so much of this. Furthermore there will be stretches of beach with broken down pieces of micro plastic from bb sized to the size of a grain of sand...

I’m so sorry Chloe, I feel like I totally let you down.  💔",2021-07-04 16:07:10
odibis,"I agree entirely. I work for a rescue (and have a bunch of my own pets/fosters here) and I just dread the beginning of July every year. 

My city outlawed fireworks outside of the actual 4th, but that doesn't stop folks from shooting them off for weeks leading up to it. 

We are a big town for veterans (literally our only attraction) with a large home for them and lots of programs, so the town at least takes it seriously and cops WILL go to tell people to knock it off if it isn't the 4th, for which I am grateful.... but people try to shoot off as many as they can and by the time the cops actually get there, there are no fireworks in sight. So it still happens for random 20 min increments every few hours. 

I've had my dogs on leashes for the past week when I take them to the yard to pee so that they don't get away, and all my windows/doors closed for the cats despite nice weather. The one time I figured it would be safe to just use the screen door, 9 am on Friday while I was working from home, my backyard neighbors set off a ton of firecrackers and made my cats hide for an hour after 🙄 also interrupted a meeting I was in with important clients. Yay.

11g3cmp,"In my experience, losing fat is relatively easy with proper discipline. Building muscle though, that’s freaking tough… In college, I was determined to have a 6-pack for the first time in my chubby life as I wanted to look like brad Pitt from fight club for the first time. 
I did intermittent fasting for approximately 3-4 months. Lost like 40 lbs. but I saw no six pack! I was just super skinny! Then I realized that I need to build a LOT of muscle! Like a TON! So all I did was eat & train. Kept up some of the intermittent fasting, but ate a lot of meat, chicken, fish and veggies and fruits. My weakness was carbs, sweets, starch, dairy, etc. To reduce that, I did it in phases: cut out all carbs & dairy by 5pm; after two weeks, by 2pm; after 2 more weeks, by 11am; then 9am; then completely cut off all carbs except fruits and veggies. 
This whole second phase of pure muscle toning/building  took approximately 6-8 weeks. Obviously, it was intense working out and training 5-6 days a week. Did constant  kalisthenics and hiit. Finally I woke up one day and saw my six pack! Whole process took maybe 6 months. I didn’t even plan for it to be that long. And that’s the key. I had to stop looking at the calendar, or the mirror. I literally had to ACTIVELY IGNORE the mirror…
It was genuinely the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life as far as physical and mental strain..
The thing is, I was pretty hyped up on anger & motivation after I had JUST been rejected in college by this girl I liked after she led me on.. 🤣 best revenge-bod story ever; she even tried to reach out to me after she saw my transformation, it was hilarious! But that’s off-topic..
Point is, it’s absolutely true that it takes a long while. Tons of effort, and loads of patience.",2023-03-02 17:58:37
11g3cmp,"I’ve lost 35lbs so far this year. Some of that came off with Covid in November, but a lot came back. I just kinda used that loss as a jump off point for making better decisions and I’m making very small, manageable changes. One at a time. They seem to be adding up. Trying to challenge myself somehow each month too, but so far all I’ve come up with is no soda for February, no excuses. Not sure I’ll be going back to it. 

I’m also after long lasting lifestyle changes, not a diet or something particular body. Luckily I also got cleared for physical therapy (I have been dealing with a back injury for a loooong time) not long after dropping the biggest chunk of that. The hard part is maintaining, and going even further. But I know now is when the new habits will save my ass and later is when I’ll see results from the gym, even if I may not be able to do anything heavy.  People have to want to get better, not just look better, IMO. 

For me, the ah-ha moment (so far) was realizing what I’m missing; My mom and brother both raised me and were obese. They died when I was 19 and 17, respectively. They’ve always been a motivator for not going to any extremes, but really thinking about it last month I realized I never stood a chance without fundamentals. I’m still trying to learn portioning and will eventually move onto eating actual better food, maybe when I’m not struggling to survive each week. I really just want to avoid discouragement so I’ve pledged to be kind to myself when I eventually fuck up, accept it, and move on. I just make sure not to forget that fuck up the next time and it helps a lot. I won’t build new habits at 34 by beating myself up because my mom didn’t prepare me 25 years ago, and I sure as shit can’t blame a dead person. 

All I know is I wanna add a few more days onto the end of my life after all that I’ve subtracted doing crazy shit in my teens and 20’s. 

My only motto in physical therapy and this broader journey with the ol’ meatsuit is “no steps back.” I’ll alter, divert, modify, substitute, whatever. But no backwards progress - in the gym, at home, in the kitchen, whatever. That’s where not making big huge changes and being kind to myself has helped. 

Baby steps until you can build consistency, and eventually, accountability. If you’re reading this, I dunno what your “ah-ha!” moment will be, but I hope you keep looking for it.

It wasn’t about starving myself, or changing my diet necessarily (I eat mostly vegetarian with fish and eggs, but learning to listen to my body and how gross I felt eating most meats was another hurdle), it was about not eating after I was full from boredom/meds making me crave salt.

Not to mention it melts your muscle. You stay the same shape only shrink, never improving your frame. No one ever told me I can just eat a little less and lift (a more enjoyable way of burning calories for me) and have a better effect, so I went the wrong direction. 

Bodybuilding for me has been a way of reclaiming food, and reclaiming power over my body and mind. As someone who gets super depressed - rapid gains or no rapid gains - lifting and eating more were the best decisions I’ve made for my health in the past 15 years.

-kids snack (and toys/cake ingredients/etc for birthdays!! some places will prepare birthday bags)

raro9d,"don't be hesitant of public adjusters either.

yea, they take a cut.

but yea, they will get you more out of your jackhole insurance company. they're all nickle and diming slimy sons of bitches.

dealing with insurance for any reason is the most grueling thing in adult life. by far in my experience. you pay them to do something with them doing nothing for so many years and then when it's finally time for them to do something, they nickle and dime the hell out of you. happily pay someone to deal with their bs any day. 🙏

raro9d,"Wish I knew this. Got my car totaled last summer, they offered me 4K even tho it was worth 9k on Kelly blue book 😞",2021-12-07 14:48:10
raro9d,"You're correct that KBB will be inaccurate, normally KBB is higher than what vehicles are aelling for..but currently KBB is most often **too low** due to the rapid inflation of vehicle prices in the market.

Your best bet is to allow them to make you an offer, then look into the market (Cargurus.com or Carsforsale.com) and see if you can replace your car for the amount offered.

If not, contact the insurance and tell them you want them to provide 3 examples of the same vehicle you had insured, which can be bought for the amount they're paying you.

They will most often raise the amount in order to replace your asset for one of similar value (which is the entire point of insurance).

I wouldn't worry about ""lawyering up"" or anything, unless they refuse to budge and their amount will NOT replace your car with a similar condition model. If that's the case, then it may (or may not) be worth lawyering up.

The most likely result will be them paying what it takes to replace your vehicle 👍 ..which is what they're supposed to do.",2021-12-08 18:44:23

The original, physical location is upperclass, and these other restaurants…their names…are not 😅, so I assume the food isn’t all the same in this particular restaurant.

Anyway, there was an article last year about Applebee’s and their virtual restaurant “Cosmic Wings” or whatever. I guess it’s a form of trickery (for some restaurants) because there may be a good chunk of customers who refuse to *knowingly* order from chain locations they’ve had bad experiences with. But I also wonder if some of these virtual restaurants are separate entities in name and staff, and they pay the franchisee/owner, of that location, rent to use part of their space and appliances in order to “be a restaurant” to generate income. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Idk",2021-06-21 00:06:49

We’re having a baby soon and my husband kept seeing used cribs on Kijiji and wanted to just get that.

The ozone is in horrible condition,

from fluorocarbons in our atmosphere.

they are too small to be seen by normal vision

but there's getting to be more of us each year

we come from a variety of places

like Styrofoam containers & aerosol cans

we love to eat the ozone it's our favorite dessert

and if you don't have an ozone then the sun can really hurt

I must admit we make a lot of garbage

this dump is filled up way above the brim

if we don't make an effort to recycle

the future could be looking mighty grim

someone's cutting down the O-town forest

it's not enough to sit around and grieve

if we don't protect our flora and our fauna

then we won't have the oxygen to breathe

Toxoplasmosis may cause flu-like symptoms in some people, but most people affected never develop signs and symptoms. For infants born to infected mothers and for people with weakened immune systems, toxoplasmosis may cause serious complications.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-29/feral-cat-management-device-felixer-tested-at-animal-reserve/12296874 
It’s a super successful program which has eliminated heaps of feral cats in a cost effective way. Oh and approved…
And Dr Moseby said at no point during the study the Felixer accidentally fired on a native animal — it only targeted feral cats.


And from a case study done
Twenty Felixers were set to fire across vehicle tracks and dune crossings for 6 weeks. It eliminated two thirds – or 33 cats – of the local feral cat population, in six week just in an area of 2300 hectares. 
https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR19132


Or let’s look at another successful project with less traps and greater area! 
“ The first trial, which deployed 8 Felixer™ traps over 14,000 ha of forest for 8 weeks, reduced feral cat activity by up to 24%. This reduction in activity was maintained for 5 months after the traps were removed, suggesting that their use may have long term benefits to native species survival. SWCC is continuing to improve the efficacy of the traps by deploying the units in areas where feral predators have been spotted by camera traps.”

Meaning traffic is already backed up significantly and all cars should use both lanes as far as possible and then alternate at the point of closure. Yes, it’s not actually advisable to fly to the point of closure and then slam on the brakes, but when so few drivers utilize the zipper merge, this will be the consequence of the not-yet-closed lane being available— people will USE IT. 🤦🏻‍♂️",2023-03-06 11:59:16

Edit: in case no one saw my comment

Here is how. I used something like this. >>https://calculator.academy/average-rating-calculator-star-rating/#f1p1|f2p0<<

My score was always 5.0, I hadn’t made a trip in ages. I went on one, the next few days or so my score went down to 4.90. I had been on 21 trips so I assumed 20 of these were 5 stars. I typed the last ride as a 4 star and a 3 star until it arrived at my current rating, which means that the driver I just had gave me 3 stars. I know it wasn’t from any other driver because I hadn’t used uber in a while. If you type 20 5-star reviews and 1 3-star review in to that calculator you will arrive at 4.90 which is my current uber rating.

For *every* interaction, you point your phone at the person's face and give them 5 stars. 5 stars here, 5 stars there. Picked up your coffee? Barista 5 stars. Take an Uber? 5 stars. Hold the door for a stranger? 5 stars. 

Instead of ""credit ratings"", everyone has a ""star rating"". 

Want to buy a house in this neighborhood? ""Only 3.5 ⭐ and above, please""

The main character gets invited to a wedding that's ""4.3 ⭐ and above ONLY"". But her rating is, like, 4.1. So the main character goes above and beyond, way out of her way, to despirately try and up her rating before the wedding. 

**Nothing is genuine**. Every interaction is **fake**, just to try and get 5 stars. 

Until... one day... at the airport, where everyone is stressed, she gets into an argument and a random stranger gives her 1 ⭐. 

Her overall rating plummets and you can see how it really ruins her life.

We ended up getting a driver who could barely handle the basic pleasantries which is fine like I’m not looking for a new best friend or anything on my ride, but his car had NO AC! We were attending a wedding in L.A. in June! So imaging going across Hollywood to Venice dressed to the 9’s with no air conditioning.

The cherry on top was his car randomly stalling (not a manual transmission) and no stereo. 

Come to find out after airing our greivenance’s once we got dropped off that the girl in our party who volunteered to call the Uber has a 1.2⭐️ rating and has barfed in and god knows what else in multiple drivers cars.

From another thread:

> A lot of times, it's those tight schedules you mentioned. Dispatch likes to push us company schmucks pretty hard sometimes. I don't have that problem with my current gig but I've seen it happen plenty of times. Nothing makes a tough job tougher than having someone riding your ass about how you're doing that job. For OTR drivers (Over the road, the vast majority of truckers) those minutes can really add up over time. Most of them are driving 7 days a week. It's not just about getting to the next dock on time but also setting yourself up for the one after that, and then the one after that, etc... Being late on a load one day can have a chain reaction that can take days to recover from. 

> Plus, if truckers didn't pass each other when they came up on another rig going just a little slower than them, you'd end up with a huge line of rigs in the right lane. Nobody wants that. 

> My current gig doesn't have me racing a clock as much as most so, the biggest reason for me is that a road with no one in front of you is a safer road. The more time I spend behind someone, the more likely that they do something that effects me and my safety. I want to spend as much of my 11 hour drive clock as is possible with no one in front of me.

pf3m48,"I love this shit. Makes sense. My mom wanted to be very close with me as a baby/infant/small child, she was usually gentle with me as a kid. My bio father, however, is a tough love & suck it up kind of person, & would punish me for going to my mom when I needed comfort. He was also a yeller, & would yell at my mom for ""coddling"" me, because he felt that I needed to learn how to get over whatever was bothering me on my own. He has his own mess of issues, but his reasoning was he didn't ""want no pussy for a kid"" (yes he said that to me many times as a child), & he also made sure to frequently let me know that he wanted a son instead of a daughter. As far as my mom puts it, I wasn't a needy baby/infant by any means & wasn't much of a crier & would only make a fuss if something was wrong. 

I learned later in life that this was really just him avoiding his fatherly duties, considering I still reach out to him to try & keep in touch & he always ignores me. 🙃 Also, fun fact for everyone, pointing & laughing at your toddler/kid when they're crying is definitely not the way to do it. To this day I have trouble crying & expressing emotion because for so much of my childhood I was forced to bottle it up, the only person I can even halfway express my emotions to is my mom. 

As an adult now, I still only trust my mom with everything. She remarried & my dad is amazing, I asked him to adopt me (I even call him dad, & I call my bio father by his name when referring to him). & while I trust my dad, it's still nowhere near the same as I trust my mom.

pf3m48,"Try to focus your avoidance-defeating efforts on beginning to see a therapist (telehealth - video or telephone appointments from home - is still widely available due to the pandemic, makes this a little easier. Also many places you can make your appointment through an online form👍). 

When the time comes for the first appointment, do your best to make yourself power through and get it done. Keep in mind the first time is the hardest and that's just part of how it do. 

The same goes for if you miss the appointment. Try to accept that this is an inherent possibility to having avoidance issues, along with related anxiety and whatever else. Don't beat yourself up if this happens; try to have compassion for yourself, awareness of your limitations, and the knowledge that limitations and disorders aren't your fault, no more than sneezing is your fault if you have a cold. Let it be okay and be enough just to get up and try again when you're ready after something like that happens.

During the first appointment, discuss the stress and struggles you experienced in just getting to this point of making it to a first appointment. Ask for and write down some tips on helping you through coping with showing up to future therapy appointments.

Plan to do something to give yourself a treat after every appointment. Anything a bit special that would make you happy would work. My mom used to take me out for drive thru after appointments to help motivate me to go, and what can I say; it was highly effective, and helped me associate attending doctor & therapy appointments with being rewarded, and it helped. 

Focus at first just on showing up to (or answer the phone for) regular appointments, and with the therapist's guidance, build on recovery from there. :)

pf3m48,"Thank you, and I don’t mind at all. 

There were a lot of things to process but what stuck with me and what I still use are journaling, analogies and quotes to give me a different perspective.

Journaling helps me process my feelings by being able to vent without fear of unintended consequences (perceived or not) and allows me time to gather my thoughts to better be able to present them if necessary.  It also helps me to understand my thought process.  Sometimes my mind feels like a mouse trapped in a wheel…going round and round but not making progress. 

A quote that helps me with this is “Reading without reviewing is like eating without digesting.”   


Another suggestion was the STOP 🛑 sign analogy. 

S - Stop!
T - Think about what’s causing you anxiety. 
O - Other factors that may be at play?
P - Praise yourself for recognizing something was wrong, and taking the time to acknowledge it and realizing you want or need to change.  

The last step is oftentimes the most difficult because I had a deep rooted aversion to receiving praise even when well deserved. I still tend towards shying away at first but am realizing it’s okay to feel good about accomplishments. 

The other tactic that helps which goes along with the above is to visualize a helpful quote if possible, again to provide perspective. For example, “Most people don’t tackle a pizza in one go, they break it down into manageable pieces first.”  Only take what you can handle in the moment. More is available when you’re ready.

mjhd2z,"I do this all the time. It started slowly, but the last few years I started noticing exactly how negative I am to myself. I didnt really realize how constant it was until a couple of relationships back to back where each ex commented about my lack of self confidence. That threw me for a loop because it's not that I don't love myself, I'm just really bad at being loving to myself.  Once I realized the effect my self-degradation was having not just to me but to my relationships as well, I have been trying to be more aware of my thoughts as they happen and it has helped a ton.
I have also gotten pretty used to talking to myself this past year though because of living alone with a chronic illness during covid. But, it's actually kind of hilarious because now I just end up kind of correcting myself mid ""thought"", so really I guess I've just started responding to the voices in my head which might mean I'm going insane but hey I'm happier so that's what matters, right? 😆 Anyway, I've always been a person who is maybe a little too reflective, and I have a tendency to kind of ruminate to the point that it effects my day to day in relatively significant ways. I'm so much harder on myself than I am on anyone else. I'm a fierce advocate for other people, but not much of one for myself. Overall I think this has the potential to be a positive trait but without keeping it in check and showing myself the same respect that I do for others, it just became so consistently negative that it's hard to break out of.  I think saying things out loud has made it easier for me to really hear myself, and in turn advocate for myself the same way I would for a friend if I hear someone talking down to them. Now I try to see the negative thoughts as a bully to stand up to, and it's had a wonderful effect.",2021-04-04 03:10:50

The reason why we get so little is because SNAP follows the guideline of the federal minimum wage of $7.25.  Our state's minimum wage is $12.

Naturally, stuff went up in price a little.  Well according to SNAP, a family of 4 making $40,000/year in a medium cost of living state is well off and only gets $92/month.  If we made the same in Alabama, then yes, I'd understand.

c9pyef,"My grandfather went to the same cafe every morning for many years. When he passed away many of the waitress and other personnel attended the service and where as sad as our family.

c9pyef,"Definitely.  I work retail at the famed 3 letter pharmacy.  I had this one customer who I adored and was like a grandma to me and thus I called her that.  A couple of weeks pass and I haven't seen her and got worried.  

My next shift I was called into the office and my manager and pharmacy manager (I thought I was in serious trouble) sat me down to say she passed right after I went on a long weekend vacation.  I was absolutely shook up and was sick over this.  

You begin to look forward to certain customers and filling them in on life and vice versa.  I miss her so much 💔.",2019-07-06 19:46:42
c9pyef,"Kind of similar thing to happen to my family as well. There was this lovely Chinese buffet that we would go to at least once a week. The owner was always super kind, and she had a younger daughter who would come to our table and teach us Chinese, ask for homework help, or just sit and chat. We went by one day and it was just closed 🤷🏻‍♀️

We started going to another buffet since our favourite closed and then one day we came in and saw our friend! She wasn’t an owner, but she worked there. It was so good to see her, and hear that she and her family were doing alright.",2019-07-06 15:51:26

hx2gpk,"Same! The pharmacy is the worst for me. Masks + huge glass partition. I'm always having people repeat themselves, and even then it's hard because the pharmacy tech always asks ""Birthday?"" And I always confuse that with ""First name?""

nt9vbv,Before I began chemo(lost my hair) I was never a girl who was chilly. I was always warm. Now I’m freezing all the time. If I could also add; keep reaching out to your friends who are sick. I’ve been doing chemo for 2 years straight and I wish more people checked in on me. 💐,2021-06-06 04:03:51
nt9vbv,"Can confirm!  For me the cold and skin issues were brutal, but I would add to this list something that really saved me:  lip balm.   My lips were a mess as well and a friend sent me some organic lip balms that were amazing, scentless and compact so I could have them in my pocket at all times 👍",2021-06-06 08:23:48
nt9vbv,"I didn’t have cancer myself, but I was very sick at one point in my life.  I loved it when someone brought my favorite food.  If DoorDash and Ubereats existed back then, it would have been 💯

Also, I was in pain.  Anything someone could have done to make it easier for me and make me move less, like helping picking something up that I just dropped, or bringing something to me.  Doing the dishes.  It was great when I had help.  It’s awful when everyday things are difficult, because a lot of people - including those close to me - didn’t understand how much it hurt to move sometimes.  A simple step in a certain direction, kneeling... it all hurt.  To have someone get it and understand?  Again.. 💯",2021-06-06 17:15:56
nt9vbv,"I am one of the people who I wished checked in on my friends more, I have anxiety and adhd and covid made my symptoms a lot worse, especially because I had to stop working. I think you are showing so much grace about your situation 🌷

if you like animals, I think my cats and dog are pretty cute, I could offer some cute pics haha, but I hope you the best of luck with treatment! I normally don’t comment, but I am so sorry the world has let you down and it has been a very isolating time ❤️",2021-06-06 13:05:03
nt9vbv,"My mom is in year three of chemo for brain cancer, and its so hard. She's still so sick, even though she's doing so much better, and it hurts me so much how her support network that was initially so strong has just completely fizzled out. All those people that loved her so much just moved on and forgot. Real friends, people of true character, stay with others through the hard stuff. That's what I've taken away from this and try to always remember with the select few people I love. I hope you have at least a core group, too, that IS there with you and still being supportive. I KNOW how hard it is to live with cancer... You're fucking doing it though. That's a goddamn feat. Remember that because you should be SO proud of how strong you've been. I wish you nothing but the absolute best in your treatment dude. Keep being a bad bitch and kick its ass.💜",2021-06-06 15:53:07
nt9vbv,"Thank you, I wish you the best with your treatment as well. I’m always here if you need to chat. I’m grateful for the support I’ve gotten from the cancer subs.💐",2021-06-06 10:14:49
nt9vbv,That’s very kind of you. I appreciate it. I really don’t have any other options than to deal with this. I’m just trying to do it with grace. 💐,2021-06-06 08:49:09
nt9vbv,Suddenly I own so many hats 🧢,2021-06-06 07:28:23
nt9vbv,I get some test results Monday and I may get to stop chemo for a while. That would be amazing but also scary. My goals are simplistic; it’s important that I keep exercising and stay as active as possible. I try and make the most out of everything. 💐,2021-06-06 08:31:44
nt9vbv,I hope that your mom keeps kicking ass too. I appreciate those words more than you know. Thank you so very much. I’ll be thinking about her. 💐,2021-06-06 16:15:33
nt9vbv,"I’m so sorry for your loss, he sounds like an amazing man. I feel fortunate, I’m a little younger and the chemo is easier for my body to handle right now. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. 💐",2021-06-07 00:02:08
nt9vbv,"I send you a lot of virtual hugs 💜 don't be afraid to ask help from psychologist or anyone who work for helping people with chronic illnesses especially on the mental health care. I know how hard it can be to have an appointment when you're in awful pain, but it's important to find someone to talk about how you feel, physically and mentally, and how hard it is for you to live in those conditions. Otherwise take a notebook and write in it when you feel really bad. It helps when you can't speak to someone. I hope you can have some peaceful times in all this pain. Lots of love from an unknown on internet ♥️",2021-06-06 08:11:05

vtjoiq,"I used to work at ANZ and the way used to sell it was ""it's kinda embarrassing when your card declines, so we're doing the customer a favour and allowing the transaction to still go through!""

Yeah, and I suppose a surprise fee when you're broke af is less embarrassing 🙄",2022-07-07 22:16:48
vtjoiq,Lmao bro said “overdrafts are a perk” 💀,2022-07-07 17:01:56
vtjoiq,BoA doesn't do that. 😉,2022-07-07 17:55:30
vtjoiq,"This ^ Certainly a good reason to not FULLY opt out of overdraft protection, but to at least recieve the minimum. If you want to make sure your mortgage, car loan, or credit card payments, (anything that is an ACH transaction) to go through.. You'll definitely want the minimum OD protection. Opting fully out just means you'll get hit with a fee and your bills won't get paid. I'd rather get hit with a fee and know my bills are paid personally.

Debit cards on the other hand, I'd say it's a case by case basis on whether or not you want to have overdraft protection turned on for that. If you're someone who is usually low on funds and might accidentally make a $3 dunkin purchase into the negative, well that coffee just became a $38 dollar coffee. But if you're usually good with maintaining a balance, in my opinion it's good to have for unexpected expenses, such as car repairs and shit.

Example; I once had a $2,500 car repair that popped up one day thanks to my TCM and clutch deciding to say fuck it 🙃 That was a fun day",2022-07-08 03:43:39

hk1z5y,Dogs are creatures of habit over creatures of self preservation. He’s probably like... what are they doing? This isn’t how we go on walks! So even if his feet are burning it would take training to shape his behavior back to walking on the grass and not the sidewalk. Shorter walks and even booties for really hot days?

hk1z5y,"Great question. My job is on the treatment side of things rather than the prevention side but I did some googling so take the following with a grain of salt! 

The article I read mentioned measuring their paws by placing the paw on a piece of paper and tracing around it to get a measurement. If it fits well, they may be less uncomfortable 

As to hating the boots, that’s a training issue, which is fixed with consistency and reinforcement. I saw boots with multiple straps to keep them more tightly secured (Alcott Adventure Boots brand). And I would start with one boot on for a short period of time just around the house, maybe while watching TV so you can monitor your pup. You can also leash her to your belt while moving around the house and training, so she can’t throw them off when you’re not looking. 

Associate the boots with a word like “boots” while putting it on and then reinforce with a small piece of a treat. After a minute, repeat “boots” give another treat. So the first day or two, put on one boot and reinforce with treats every few minutes for say, 10 min. Then remove the boot and give her lots of pets and praise. 

After a few days, two boots, for thirty (monitored) minutes with intermittent treats and praise. Then at a week or two of just getting her used to them around the house, she will hopefully come around to associating the boots with praise and treats. 

In my experience, the key to teaching a new behavior is consistency + reinforcement, and wearing boots is just shaping a new behavior. 

I hope this works for your baby. You can also desensitize your rescue to having her paws handled with a similar system of touching her paws, saying “yay, paws!!” And giving treats. Start slow, and increase handling over time! 

I hope this helps a little, if you have more questions please let me know. Good luck! 🐾",2020-07-03 04:44:12

ok8gb0,"It’s an unspoken rule to know your order in your head when it’s time to build your sandwich at Subway.

What you’re calling “unspoken” is actually code for “I made the whole thing up”.

So again, and to be clear, while it’s plausible in the sense that it’s also plausible we live in a multiverse and I cannot disprove that, I also cannot disprove that here or there, a gunsmith may hold your guns for you for a short time. If that’s the case, they’re doing it not because they are a gunsmith, but because they are likely your actual, know them apart and separately from them just being a gunsmith, friend, who just so happens to be a gunsmith.

Again, I ask you to supply ANY evidence at all that this is a ‘thing’, or just cut your losses now and admit you’ve made this up, and are actually DAMAGING people by providing misinformation regarding deadly, serious issues.

The notion that you think people just drop their perfectly working guns off ‘for a cleaning’ like their child at a daycare is the most telling part of your manufactured fantasy.

That’s just NOT a thing.

As an example, the common glock and similar-construction striker-fired pistols field strip down into merely FIVE basic sub-assemblies (Frame, Magazine, Slide Assembly, Barrel, and Recoil Spring Assembly) in less than 30 seconds, and can be given a basic clean and oil in less than FIVE minutes with minimal tools. My ‘go-to’ cleaning kit is less than the volume of a baseball.  This is the level that most guns of this style will be stripped to >99% of the time.

An AR pattern rifle basically the same.  Even some of the more complicated take-downs just aren’t that much more complicated.

1. Glocks do not have traditional ‘firing pins’. They are a ‘striker-fired’ weapon.

At it’s forged Rockwell hardness, I have *extreme* difficulty believing this could be done with any kind of flush-cut ‘snipping’ tool, ESPECIALLY while the striker was assembled in the slide, or the slide was assembled in the frame.

3. It could be *removed* but that goes beyond a simple 5-assembly field-strip, and requires tools and a few minutes of time, as well as knowledge. There would be no “simply clipped the firing pin on her glock” as the commenter stated.

g90kms,"Delivery drivers will be on time if you tipped.

If, you're like the jackass who ordered $60 of pizza and only tipped $2.50.... you can forget about prompt service and professionalism, as drivers would constantly reject your order, and round and round it goes until some guy HOURS later picks it up and delivers to you (only because at that point, Doordash covered your cheap ass and gave the driver more pay in lieu of your tip).


We drivers know how much or how little you tip in the app.  The ones tipping us a fair tip (20% or more), we would go above and beyond for.

The ones tipping us $0.01 or promising a $20 tip in cash, and then slamming the door in our faces, deserve horrible service.  There's even talk about how someone will give a VERY generous tip in the app, the driver delivers promptly and professionally, and then right when they complete the order, it's far less.  Why? Because while the driver was en route to your location, the customer called Doordash and made up a story about how they made a mistake on the tipping amount, so Doordash revoked the tip unbeknownst to the driver, until the driver completed the order.



Instacart scammers do this too, show a big tip, and takes it away.   Some drivers broke down, completely demotivated to continue working and went home early, others chose to file for unemployment because of scammers.

And other jackasses who called the company and make a BS story about how the driver never delivered just to get a refund on their order, essentially making their meal free, ended up causing some drivers, myself included, to lose their jobs. 

 I lost my GrubHub job because of scammers lying about me never delivering and always missing items (even though I double and triple check).  At that point, GrubHub was my main income.  Thank goodness I still had Doordash to fall back on, but money was really really tight for awhile there because of scammers.


Thank you for your appreciation.  I wish all customers were good like you!


Why tipping is a big deal:

Doordash pays a maximum of $5.
Each order takes 30-40 minutes.

It used to be that if you tipped, say $10 on the app, Doordash will give us $1 and adding your $10, would give us $11 for your order that took 30+ minutes.  Now the Doordash pay increased to $3 so it's marginally worth it.  

But if a customer doesn't tip, the maximum amount would be $5... **However**, if it's an add-on order it's $2.50, if it's less than 3 miles, it's $2.50. 

 On paper we make pretty good money $15-$25 an hour.  But, customers are forgetting that we use our own cars.  So we have to pay for our repairs.  We also need to use our own insurance if we don't have a spouse working with a company that provides insurance.  We also have no employee rights, we're responsible for our taxes, there's no overtime pay or sick pay or bereavement pay or even hazard pay.  

If we get into an accident or hurt, we can get deactivated/""fired"".  And until recently, unemployment didn't cover gig workers.  So we're actually worse off in that regards compared to a waitress at a restaurant.


I personally drive for Doordash despite this, because it's the only way I can get some income since my husband's job schedule, and my kids being younger than 4... makes it almost impossible for me to work any shift. 

 For many dashers, their shifts are something like 3 hours in the morning, 5 hours at night, 2 hours really late night if they are bored out of their minds and can't sleep 🤣.  We pick our schedules and can take off whenever.  So that's a good perk, despite the fact that we lose out on benefits.


I just wish customers would tip more often, and to stop trying to screw the drivers over especially during a pandemic, when most drivers lost their day jobs and are using gig work to fall back on for income 🤦",2020-04-27 21:47:16

“Is it a hot drink?”

“No it’s cold, it’s a frappe.”

“Is it blended or on ice?”

“Blended.”

“Hmm, you might like our Frappuccino, it’s sort of a milkshake/smoothie with coffee, but we have some without coffee too.” 

“Yeah that’s what I said, a frappe.” We, of course, aren’t allowed to correct customers. 

“What flavor would you like?” 

“I JUST WANT A FRAPPE.”

“Sir, I can’t make you a Frappuccino without knowing what flavor. Your options are (insert all 83920595 of them).”

“I just want a regular one.”

Then the customer will pull up to the window and tell me the last time it was a different color, or had chocolate shavings on top, etc etc etc. Or, my true favorite, I confirm the order before handing over the drink and use the correct word Frappuccino and they tell me I’m wrong, they ordered a frappe 😤

You could lie, but also part of getting a abortion is measuring the fetus to see how long it is, which tracks pretty closely with how long ago your last period was (most women have a consistent 28 day cycle).

  Maybe the bass wasn’t heavy enough - but apparently the music was! 😳

Or maybe I needed to play it longer - and then immediately put silicone in the hole?  I read other advice that the vibration will cause them to leave - and if it done on a fairly regularly basis, it will prevent them from returning.

I had a ton of them on my deck in my old rented place.  They would always greet me and get in my face when I went outside to smoke. But they  didn't bother me and I like bees so I just sort of let them be.  I also worried about whether or not killing them would be bad for the environment.  

I could tell they were carpenter bees because of their interest in the deck and read up about them how they are mostly harmless etc.  I also kind of resented my landlord for being a cheap lazy mother fucker (although if I was in his place I would probably act the same way to be perfectly honest, minimize expenses maximize revenue 🤷‍♂️. Couldn't really blame the guy) so I really didn't give a fuck if the bees fucked up the deck.  He probably didn't either since it badly needed a staining and looked like it was going to rot out in a few years if it didn't get one.

Oh, don't worry about coming to the hospital, we're still 300km from you, and before you find a car and start traveling over, we'll already be on our way to you. Just sit tight and prep some comfort food for the parents"".

So I'm here, calm as a cucumber, thinking all is well, and then an ambulance comes into the family home, and the personnel inside are badgering me for my mom's medical history, and my dad's hooked up to all sorts of machinery in the back. Freaked me the hell out, much worse than if I'd known it was actually quite serious.

Either that or Disney got the state to put it in.

I imagine that conversation going a little something like this:

Flo: say, mister, you're that dreamy Walt Disney fella aren't ya?

Walt: why yes, yes I am. Thank you for the compliment.

Flo: uh, Mr. Disney--

Walt: call me Walt 😉

Flo: ☺️🤭 ok, Walt. Well Walt, I was just wondering why you were buying up all this crummy worthless swamp land. I mean sure I understand you built a theme park in California and all but you can't do anything with this stuff. Why don't we go check out some other place. Here, why don't get you a drink. What'll you have?

Walt: two fingers of Scotch, neat. And to answer your more important question Flo doll this land will make a fortune!

Flo: but how?!?! I mean it's just water, bogs, alligators, trees and mosquitoes...

Walt: ahhh sweetheart, i know ya don't see it now, but I think this is the start of a beautiful relationship. Let's relax in the jacuzzi and we'll go over the finer details of how not only I'll get filthy rich off of this, but baby, so are you....

And that's how not only did Florida become Disney's bitch, pre women's suffrage basically, especially the Central Florida area, but is a viable reason that I-4 could have been built for Disney........

Also, if that little conversational supposition left a bad taste in your mouth it was meant to. Most if not all companies are sleazy like that and they mistreat somebody. Most of the time that's us or our future generations. I'll leave it at that as I don't feel like being up on my soap box...",2020-12-31 11:17:07

gxvk55,"My daughter is a ""certified"" genius. She was tested by the school district psychologist after she passed the districts 12th grade testing in 3rd grade. There were 7 tests she took:

Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale.

Universal Nonverbal Intelligence.

Differential Ability Scales.

Peabody Individual Achievement Test.

Wechsler Individual Achievement Test.

Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.

Woodcock Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Disabilities.

That's the standard regiment. After that John Hopkins sent out someone to give her their CTY test. Then the Davidson Foundation tested her. After that Mensa offers you memberships but she found more in common with the kids at Prometheus Society. 

She skipped grades, struggled through high school, couldn't tie her shoes until 6th grade. Until her junior year in college felt like she'd never fit in anywhere. She's working on her PhD now and just casually throw out she's going to apply to medical school 🙄. I know a lot of geniuses because of my journey with her.

k6yl7c,Thanks for the info. I knew dry skin could cause acne but didnt know it would help form deep cystic acne which I usually have! Im going to try a less harsh face washing routine for a bit 👍,2020-12-05 15:09:16
k6yl7c,This is me! Just discovered more moisture = less oily skin and less acne 🙃,2020-12-05 21:05:56
k6yl7c,"Face oils changed my life (you should know I'm 37 and they made me break out in my 20s) and changed my whole perspective on needing to dry out my skin (especially in middle age). For those who might still have too much hormonal oiliness to use a face oil (like I did only a few years ago), I would suggest an oil based face wash-- even if you double wash (totally cool) and follow with an exfoliant. The way it melts oil out of press is truly amazing. 

Just remember: 1, put oil based cleansers on a DRY FACE (that is how the oil bonds with the oil in your pores, we all know oil and water don't mix) 2, gently message in the oil alone, then with tepid (not hot or cold) water, and rinse off with same 3, make sure the water runs clear and then follow up with toner (if only cleanser, but something gentle like rose or aloe based) or your chosen second cleaning method, then toner 4, whatever moisturizer you know works for you 😀",2020-12-05 08:46:46
k6yl7c,"I‘m an esthetician and I second this. I see this in patients quite a lot. Also interesting to note that with oils it also depends on wether the oil you‘re using is high in linoleic or oleic acid because of the different fatty acid components they deliver. 
Jojoba oil is a great „oil“ (actually a wax ester) and is really similar to our skin‘s natural sebum and poses a low risk factor. Rosehip oil is another one I recommend to clients because it is a natural source of vitamin A/retinol and can be nice for beginners or people who are more sensitive when it comes to retinol. As always tho make sure to make you‘re on research and consult your local derm/doc/esthetician ☺️",2020-12-05 10:12:51

k2r2l0,Seriously. My SO and I got a cat together not knowing this. He came from a bad situation at birth and had to be smuggled out of the house by a cousin of the mother’s owner. He had a lot of separation anxiety and would freak out and aggressively and deeply bite us when we grabbed keys to leave. We adopted another cat this year and his whole attitude’s completely changed. He went from meowing randomly all over the house and biting us randomly to the sweetest cat you could ask for. I think he’s only bitten once in the whole time she’s been here and that’s cuz I grabbed his legs and pulled him out from under the couch to go to the vet 😅,2020-11-28 22:45:21

Any advice for the best way to introduce new animals either at home or bringing her to a shelter? Is there any possibility that, even if they get along at first, it could get physical to the point of drawing blood?

dves5t,"There are a couple of money saving tricks, but generally... yes. Full circle is imminent. Paying for all the services will soon catch up to cable,  especially if you include music.

Trick 1: Having T-Mobile pays $10 toward my Netflix.

Trick 2: HBO doesn't yet check to see if you've shared the password, so half the cost there. (They'll surely close that up soon.)

Trick 3: (for music) Spotify family plan. $3 each up to six accounts. They too don't yet confirm address, but they will someday.

I pay for CBS and will probably pay for Disney. But I refuse to pay Amazon anything. And I probably won't pay for YouTube until it's so incredibly bad, there's no other choice. (Sooo, next month or so. 😆)",2019-11-13 00:59:13

Do you want to keep putting air in your tire every week? Or get the tire fixed? There are better analogies I’m sure but you get the point.

They are, by setting the bone and putting the broken arm in a splint until it heals, or even getting a prosthetic if it can't heal--not having a good mindset about the broken arm.

The pills work. They don't cure anything (no one said they do), but they relieve symptoms enough to live life.

>I had anxiety years ago, until I dug into why I was nervous about things. I realized to be afraid was silly, to be paralyzed with the notion. When u analyze instead of fear, u can beat it. It takes effort to dig in urself n figure out what's wrong.

cms74h,"Long comment, tldr at the end.

I went to Minnesota School of Business and got scammed hard. The first year I attended, the per credit cost was $210 (this was in 2006) and the two year program that I signed up for was called ""Exercise sciences"".  Each semester, the cost per credit rose in spades with my final semester there in 2009 costing me $470 per credit and the school changed the program to be called ""Health Fitness Specialist"" and added new class requirements to finish the degree so that it took me 3 years to finish instead of 2. 

After graduating, I quickly realized that my degree was completely worthless. I couldn't get a job at the YMCA, much less a for profit gym and, even if I could have, the top paying jobs were between $11 and $13 per hour. I can make more money working as a manager at McDonald's. I also found out after graduating that my credits would not transfer to my local community college even though the for profit college had assured me since day 1 that they would transfer with no problems. They even continued to insist that the community college must be getting their facts wrong when I called to complain 😡.

I ended up going back to a real school (U of MN) but I now have over $100,000 in student loan debt with over half of that in private student loans, a completely useless degree from the for profit school and no way to discharge them.  Eventually, the for profit school was sued multiple times successfully but they just filed for bankruptcy and that was that... Wish that was an option for me but student loans don't discharge in bankruptcy court.

TL;DR: went to for profit school, got scammed out of $60,000, school got sued and declared bankruptcy and all students are still stuck with their loans and no transferable credits.",2019-08-07 12:34:38

I had a resume class (through a job that was laying us off) that actually had us learn the ""buzzwords"" for different skills, and had us put a sideboard on our resume, just for buzzwords. It looks odd, basically like an un-bulleted list, in a neat and tidy area. The software finds the words on my resume either in the body, or in the sideboard. 

And they also told us to tailor the resume for each application, and to specifically use words from the job description. Also, easy to edit cover letters, though i wasnt sure why. If a software is screening it, then no one wants to read me cover letter... BUT! It was an entry level job, in a corperation that does not usually have this entry level job, so i understand NOW that jobs up the ladder might read a cover letter.

hl45ut,I have scoliosis. The amount of times I’ve been handpicked by some old person to give them my seat on the bus… maam/sir my back hurts too 😭😭,2020-07-04 21:40:26
hl45ut,"100% this! I have Lupus and have lived with chronic pain for the last decade of my life. I too have a handicap parking tag (the kind you hang in the window). Some days I need it, other days I don’t...it depends on my pain levels and what all I need to do. If I can manage the few extra steps, or if there is a regular spot that’s close up and available, I will forgo the handicap spot, because I know how bad it sucks to really NEED it and not have it available. But if I need that spot, I’m gonna use it! I do have the visual cue of a cane sometimes, but I’m only 40, so that means I get a lot of nasty looks from people even when I use the cane. And sometimes I don’t need/bring the cane with me, so it’s even more looks on those days. And lord help me if I have to use a motorized scooter! You’d think I just ran over their great aunt Ethel! Even with the cane, and Lupus stickers all over the back of my car, I still get some nasty looks from people assuming I’m using grandma’s handicap hanging tag because I don’t “look sick” or I’m “too young” to need a handicap spot. I like to think “Well you don’t *look* stupid either...” 🤪

You hit the nail on the head when you said “It’s invalidating.” for people to say “You don’t look sick”. I think they think they’re giving us a compliment, but it actually comes out more like a back-handed insult. I went to the chiropractor the other day and had on nice clothes (for a change) and he said “Oh, you look nice! You must be having a good day! Are you having a good day?” He was quite shocked when I said “No, actually, I’m having a bad flare up right now, and I feel like shit.” He said “Well, you *look* like you’re having a good day!” I know he meant well. But it just accentuated the fact that when you feel like re-heated shit, you tend to *look* like re-heated shit too! But it also showed him that just because I put on a pair of jeans and a nice shirt (instead of yoga pants and a tank top) doesn’t mean my body all of a sudden feels better. (And along that same line, just because there’s a smile on my face, doesn’t mean I feel good!)

Invisible ailments are still very valid! Just because I *look* well, doesn’t mean that I *am* well! Don’t tell me I don’t “look sick”...I AM SICK. I will always be sick. For the rest of my life I will have Lupus and chronic pain. It won’t ever go away. You telling me I don’t look sick makes me feel even less “visible” than I already feel. Don’t tell me how I *LOOK.* *Ask me how I FEEL!*",2020-07-05 04:47:31
hl45ut,I generally don't look sick when I get a cold or fever. When I tell ppl at work that I don't feel well and won't come in the next day they think I'm just trying to skip 😒,2020-07-05 12:00:19
hl45ut,Cystic fibrosis in the house 👐 have you heard about kaftrio?,2020-07-05 01:00:46
hl45ut,Good on you for changing your stance! 😊,2020-07-04 17:16:31
hl45ut,"Your best step, call a cop.  The person would be required to show their driver's license -- mine has a very clear symbol ♿. Not all disabled people are openly so (someone with cystic fibrosis left their story here.)

Most states have serious penalties for people who park in disabled spots. Ours is $250.!! That's not chicken feed, baby! Also, the use of a disabled placard or plates, without the person assigned to them leaving the vehicle -- the fine still applies!

Can you tell what my biggest pet peeve is!? 
♿  If you are able bodied, use it! 💗",2020-07-04 21:58:27
hl45ut,"Thank you so much for this post! I have MS and walk with a cane. A cashier once asked me ""Oh, what happened to you?"" and, after I gave her a brief response, she wouldn't let it go!  Like I'm going to discuss my personal medical issues with a total stranger?! Finally, I said very loudly ""I HAVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS!"" She turned a pretty shade of red and shut up! I hope someone else benefits from this story! 💗❤️♿",2020-07-04 22:23:10
hl45ut,"I came here to post about endo as well. 

My endo affects me 24/7, not just on my period. Or well, when I had one, I’ve since had a hysterectomy. That being said, when I’m having a bad flare up I use a cane to get around. 

I recently almost had a nasty encounter with an entitled elderly lady on the bus. She started going on about how she deserved to sit in the priority seating and I should t be there because I am young and healthy. Her husband set her straight before I could say anything and I just whipped my folding cane out of my bag and smiled at her as I hobbled off the bus.  😂",2020-07-04 23:10:20
hl45ut,"I am so sorry, you deserve so much more. I read through some of your posts, and I am so glad that you are living each moment that you have, and spending time with loved ones. Last summer, a friend of a family friend died of cancer, leaving behind a husband and two boys. She had been extremely sick for a very long time, and like you, it was very uncertain how long she had to live, but the saddest part for me was how bitter she became. In a way, her life ended long before she died. She was so angry and scared, and in a way never really accepted that she was going to die. She also barely spent any time with her sons, which breaks my heart and I hate that she had to die when she was so afraid. Good luck, and stay beautiful ❤️",2020-07-05 02:40:38
hl45ut,"Give your mom a hug from me, please?! I, too, have MS (& peripheral neuropathy, etc.) and walk with a cane and have a stair lift.  I am also an intelligent and warm woman with a great sense of humor! And I hate pity above all.  Go, Mom! ❤️💟💗",2020-07-04 22:10:16
hl45ut,"Aww yeah, it’s a fine line when well-meaning strangers are asking questions - it can be emotionally exhausting! And definitely drives home the fact about a general lack of awareness.

I had a similar experience, but with a damn nurse getting me set up for IVs, just kept shaking her head going “you’re so young to be so sick”. Thanks?

That shirt sounds amazing! We definitely need something like that for the CF community 😹 “coughing because of C..ystic Fibrosis”",2020-07-04 17:14:45
hl45ut,"Oh, don’t worry, I am fully masked when I am in public 😊, even with I still get cough-based glares!",2020-07-04 21:23:21
hl45ut,"I put it back on them, and follow it up with your response 😂",2020-07-04 23:18:19
hl45ut,❤️💛🧡💚,2020-07-04 21:52:33
hl45ut,I don't assume everyone does it and i never said that...i was just referring to stuff i see daily in area i live in 😉,2020-07-04 23:33:37
hl45ut,"I'm sending you a hug, too!❤❤",2020-07-05 09:58:38
hl45ut,"Thank you for your kind words, darlin'! If someone asks I normally give them a brief answer. That cashier was apparently determined to hear a simple answer, like I broke my leg. But she went on and on and I just reached the end of my rope. I am usually a very patient person, I promise! (I worked to pass the ADA, so I know the rules.)
I wish you health and happiness, always! ❤️💗❤️",2020-07-04 22:43:41
hl45ut,"Hey 🙋🏼‍♀️ - good call! I was so sick at the time, but I will definitely report in the future. Even some of the CF teams I’ve heard could use a sensitivity refresher (looking at you, nutritionists poo-pooing small weight gain, why are you in this clinic if you don’t realize all the work that goes into this?)

Ugh, I’m so sorry you have to deal with that. It sounds like it would be uncomfortable to confront those people in your town (plus, if you’re already not feeling well, trying to stand up for yourself is exhausting). Use your placard to your full advantage! 💪🏻 (I’m considering getting one for those bad days)",2020-07-05 16:59:24
hl45ut,"I know, right - and I ALWAYS cough away from people and into my elbow, etc 🤷🏼‍♀️",2020-07-05 12:23:51
hl45ut,"That sounds like a great plan! Your parents honestly sound abusive - now more than ever there are telehealth and low-cost therapy that you may want to look into to get some support system going. 

You have a plan to get through the next few years, you are strong and you will be great. Don’t give up 💪🏻",2020-07-04 22:03:34

etv0bg,Could be reported after they identify the body. Im sure that was the longest process if they didn't have any ID on them. Water can make Bodies very hard to identify as well . 🤮,2020-01-26 07:10:29

gwv61m,"Wtf, when I was a kid I nearly drowned. Water was going in my lungs for a little bit, I accepted death, then tried one last time to get free and I saved myself. Coughed out water and stuff. I was probably 8, and there was no lifeguards, and I was out of sight of anyone. I told no one I almost drowned. Damn, I’m glad I was fine after that 😳",2020-06-05 08:37:14

It’s only one night” and I had to repeat it like 4 times before she remembered 🤦🏻‍♀️",2020-06-18 06:38:47

f8efkh,"As a native English speaker, I admire anybody who speaks English as a second language. English isn't easy to learn, and quite frankly, knowing two or more languages is admirable as hell, in my opinion. I hate that anybody from another country feels the need to apologize for not speaking it ""perfectly."" Half my damn country is so illiterate they can't use proper grammar or spell for shit.

9vb700,"Personally I started drinking almond milk instead of regular milk a couple years ago initially just to cut calories. I never looked back. Honestly I don’t think I could go full vegetarian, but I respect those that do. I try to eat a lot of chicken too primarily, mostly because I’m hella broke 😂",2018-11-08 19:49:10

9vb700,"Did you know that you only have to kill 1 cow every two years to give you sustenance rather than killing dozens of chickens or multiple pigs. 
Chickens live in the dark and get fed grains not on their natural diet. They have a miserable life and a miserable death. It’s not much better for pigs and only a little better for many cows. The fewer of these poor souls that have to live and die for us, the better.
This is a rant, but eat local and eat grass fed and finished if you can afford it. Raise your own chickens and eat the eggs. Raise your own pigs and eat the meat. If everyone did this, then it wouldn’t be such a drain on the world.

Nah, we'll let them keep fucking things up and insist it's the population that needs to change their personal habits instead of the corporations that get a free pass to fuck up the planet.

I may be a bit salty that it's foisted on us, the common folk, to try and change something most of us have no actual say in yet on a measurable scale. ",2018-11-08 19:14:33

hpza1s,"You escaped though. More than that you saw it clearly. If you have avoided relapsing back into that kind of situation... well honestly I would encourage you to reframe how you look at the past.

You escaped an addiction. You survived a cult, more or less. If you moved forward from that and didn't repeat the behavior with other people, groups, or relationships that's a bloody win my dude.

Don't just see the mistakes. See you were strong enough to move on and start over. Some people never are. Some people die in a prison they made for themselves.

That's a win. Life is short. Take your win. And a fist bump.

czurge,"Hi, I’m disabled and even though person first language is preferred by some (“person with cancer” vs cancer patient) many don’t like it. Disabled is not a bad word we need to dance around. A disability is something that affects/limits your ability to do something. 

Once most people have come to terms with it, they will call themself “disabled”. 

I chose to say “invisible disability” because people who use these carts have difficulty without them, because of whatever illness they have (which there’s a wide variety). 

It comes down to the individual how they like their condition addressed, but disabled is not a bad word 😊",2019-09-05 06:18:04

ou76ji,"Thank you OP for talking about this and thank you to all the open adults willing to discuss this!

 Communication is key, but be prepared. Your partner may not be able to tell you exactly what they like, so like someone else said, listen and pay attention.  The most important thing we can do for our partners is to take their pleasure seriously, but don't take it personally if I doesn't happen. Some of us have serious emotional and religious baggage over sex and pleasure which takes time and feeling safe.

Something else that should be addressed, some medicines affect sex drive and/or sensitivity. Antidepressants are notorious for this. 

It wasn't until we started taking edibles that sex started feeling like it did when we first got together. I think it has to do with affecting blood flow? All I know is 10mg takes the invisible woolen body mitten off of me (what the numbness feels like to me anyway) and life is great. 😘

Happy orgasms everyone, Ruth Westheimer would be proud!",2021-07-30 04:40:25
ou76ji,"I also just gotta add, I love me some penis lol 

I have cum more from my current partner (been together 8+ years) than anyone else, and it feels better too! It's a combination of us learning about what we like and who we are while also learning what the other likes.

Some of the time I dj myself during the beast dance, sometime he's guest star dj, but he's always ""backing me up with that bass"" 😎",2021-07-30 00:48:17

ou76ji,"I always go down first until she orgasms, then we have sex. First I just love her taste and just cannot get enough of her. Second, I LOVE it when she squirt in my mouth. Third, I LOVE hearing her moan and feeling her squirm.

7sgxzh,"I was the same. Wanted to upgrade my 40"" HD TV to something bigger and 4k. Impossible to find without smart features. I got a great deal on a 50"" 4K TV on eBay and it's basically made no difference to how I use my TV, as it's connected to a computer and consoles. I didn't connect it to the internet for weeks because I didn't use any of the features but I decided to try it and some of the apps are kinda useful if you want to watch something without booting up the computer. Something like catch up TV is quicker to go to the app than to load the website on the computer. I even realised that the previous owners left their Netflix logged in so I could use that if I wanted to... 🤫 I just live knowing the apps may not work forever, but that doesn't matter because I can just use the computer! But anyway, there's no reason to use the smart features if you don't want to! It works perfectly well as a dumb TV with no internet too. ",2018-01-24 02:51:43

Returned it and kept my 720p 55"" plasma... Ancient thing that still has better color quality than any new dumb panels and looks nicer even at a lower resolution. 🤷‍♂️",2018-01-23 23:30:16
7sgxzh,I have a Vizio smartcast TV and it came with a small remote similar to a fireTV remote. Needless to say I never hooked it up to WiFi. If you own a Vizio use the remote for menu n enable CEC.

I use another service that makes it obvious, so didn’t consider the convenience factor. 👍🏻",2019-11-09 08:39:34
yrs053,"Happened to me when I was 15/16, glad I left that freak a long time ago. He’s miserable and I’m living my best life 🙂",2022-11-11 00:17:32
yrs053,"Surprised this isn’t already at the top or in the original post, but the national domestic violence hotline is 1(800)799-SAFE (7233), TTY is 1(800)787-3224. You can also text START to 88788 or use the live chat feature [on their website](https://www.thehotline.org). 

If you or someone you know is being physically, emotionally, or financially abused by a family member or partner, PLEASE reach out for help before it’s too late. Even if you’re not ready or don’t feel safe to leave yet, that is OK and an advocate can help you make a safety plan to work towards that. Even if you don’t stay in the shelter, most organizations can still offer counseling, financial assistance, legal help, and lots of other services. 

And PLEASE if you are trying to help someone you know or think might be in an abusive situation, think carefully about how your actions can affect their safety. You may not face the repercussions of confronting their abuser, but they will. Make sure you speak with the survivor in a safe, private place, and have support ready to offer when you initiate that conversation (phone numbers, local resources and services, a safe place for them to store important documents or a “go bag”, etc.) and PLEASE listen to and honor their needs and boundaries because **they know their abuser best**! 

I also want to note that along with the original post, if someone has choked you in the past to the point of you losing consciousness and/or losing control of your bowels, there is an even **higher** chance that they are capable of killing you the next time it happens. 

There is absolutely zero shame in seeking help when you are in an abusive relationship. It doesn’t matter your gender identity or sexuality, abuse can unfortunately happen to anyone. It is NOT your fault, you are not alone, and there are people who can help you. Be safe and take care of yourselves and each other. Believe survivors. 💜",2022-11-11 19:19:16

You did not deserve any of that and the fact that you were required to be that strong, makes me mad on your behalf. I've laughed in the face of someone I was terrified of - sometimes that's the only tool left in your chest.

A lot of bad choices involved I will say but what shocked me was the sheer level of shame and embarrassment. 

It's mortifying to be gushing about this person you love - ESPECIALLY after just leaving an abusive relationship - and then the next second having them scream at you for buying him the wrong beer. 

I was so ashamed that I'd let myself get into this position AGAIN after trying to communicate with him and do everything ""right"".

lqaw5w,"Yeah pretty much, I use basaglar for my long acting and lispro for short acting. I changed nothing for dose or time of injection when I switched to Walmart insulin (novolin for long acting) my BG ran high for a week or two. The strength of the insulin is marked to be the same for both solutions. But no the type is an obvious difference every diabetic knows about if they pay any attention. For instance I can’t shoot up 20u BID of R and survive. I once made that mistake when it was dark and almost died. The type of R and N you get will act differently.

>We don't believe the issue is purely a price issue, he said, adding that GlaxoSmithKline has been involved in differential pricing schemes since the 1980s with vaccines and in the late 1990s with drugs for HIV/AIDS. The company has 116 programs in 50 countries.

>Johnson and Johnson works with governments to develop differential pricing approaches to help more people access their medical products. Johnson & Johnson companies have agreements with the United Kingdom for VELCADE ® (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma, and with France for RISPERDAL® CONSTA® (risperidone long-acting injection) a medication for the symptoms of schizophrenia. Companies and government agencies are also entering other types of risk-sharing agreements in order to help people gain access to new therapies sooner.

1bogwbx,When i bought my car the sales guy seemed very confused about how loans and money worked in general so i just asked him if he had a calculator i could borrow. He went and found one somewhere in the office and i typed all the numbers into it for each payment plan and said “see? I told you this one was the cheapest overall.” and signed the paper. He told me he’d never had a customer use math to calculate the total cost before 😂,2024-03-28 03:21:45

1bogwbx,"I went recently with my wife. They kept talking about interest rates, but when I asked them to break down how it actually related to the monthly payments they quoted, they literally said they couldn't because it's not a normal interest that lowers as the principal diminishes, but calculated to stay steady over time. 


So I looked at it a bit differently than OP since time value of money is important, and my approach was to sum the upfront payment and net present value discounted monthly payments -- that way, I could see how much the total costs were across options, how much discount we'd lose by paying off early, etc.


AFAIK, dealerships won't give you a discount cash flow estimation, so it's actually helpful to break it down in terms of upfront + discounted amounts in my (veery limited) experience with car dealerships -- even brought my laptop like a nerd to plug their inputs into a bad excel model 😅",2024-03-27 12:49:44
1bogwbx,"It slowly is, but these assholes still find new ways of fuckery. I bought my last car via my bank (put in what you want and get local quotes). One dealer, when I got there, tried to play their bullshit mind games with me and then tacked on a few grand in titling fees to pad their bottom line. Which was amusing because my state has a fixed fee allowable for titling. They wouldn't let me have the written quote with the exorbitant costs. Told them I was going to a different dealer.

Drove 30 minutes to another dealer, got better than the quoted price from the bank, state maximum titling ($300), and was out the door in an hour. Would have been faster but the finance guy was finishing another customer ahead of me. The only thing I didn't get was my preferred car color, but not exactly a deal breaker. 🤣

First dealer called me a few days later and I told them I got the quoted price elsewhere. They were clearly pissed, but fuck them.",2024-03-27 01:44:30
1bogwbx,"Another dealer tried to pull this on me. They had an advertised price and then told me there was mandatory market adjustments from the manufacturer.


So, while standing there with the salesman, I called the dealership across town. Asked them what their price was, asked where there were mandatory market adjustments from the manufacturer.


Suddenly he was able to knock them down. 🤣",2024-03-27 02:59:35
1bogwbx,"I LOVE haggling for cars. It brings me joy. I actually have volunteered to help friends and family buy cars just so I can haggle with these sales people.

Once, a salesmen told me he needed to speak with his manager. Got up and walked off. I immediately called another dealership across town to talk about the car they had on their lot and compare prices. When the salesmen at dealership A got back and overheard the conversation, I told the salesmen at dealership B that I had to get going and that he needed to email me a quote immediately if he wanted me to drive across town. The salesmen in front of me immediately started being more flexible with the deal we were working on 😁

You can have it prescribed online for like $60 bucks or ask your doctor if propranolol is right for you. 😉
I personally suffer from the same thing.  Not mentally but physically I can feel my self turn hot red or anxious occasionally depending on the situation. Voice becomes weak. My thoughts turn inward. My presence drops. On a beta blocker it never happens. It's crazy. And has saved me.",2024-03-27 12:29:24
1bogwbx,"Reminds me of when I went with my mother to get her current car. She’s the negotiater I just wanted to ride along 🤣

Anyway her goal was always to pay in cash so we walked away from so many dealers who tried to strong arm her into considering financing.

One tried the leave alone waiting forever trick. We had other plans that day so we decided to leave. Manager practically tripped over himself trying to keep us from leaving, even said “I have the car you want at exactly the price you requested.” They had the mechanic pull it up as we were leaving. My mom humored them and glanced inside the car and saw the check engine light on. She noped out so hard she decided she’ll never go to that dealership again.

A different dealership (surprisingly same car brand) got to the finance talking stage. Mom said, I plan to pay cash.

When he tried to cash out it was a lot of power play back and forth. Finally when he almost won, dealer said they can't agree to that price unless it's financed, as cash would cost more for the car (lies, probably illegal). He said sure, got financed, immediately drove to his credit union and explained the situation and got a new car finance from them for better rate and paid off the dealership loan the next week.

We only get obtuse looks or answers when the person asking can’t seem to grasp the task is doable for a disabled person. I say nothing, and just wait for them to observe my son blow their small minds.

Interesting observation: I am the FT caregiver, so part of my job is loading/unloading the wheelchair from the car. It’s like a free WWE match for observing people - 300lb powerchair vs 125lb small-but-loud Italian red head. But not once in 20 years has anyone offered to help me wrangle it.  

It’s also been my experience with my son, when he needs help, he speaks up. In our special needs circle, self advocating is a huge teaching point. I’m grateful for my son and what the wheelchair life has taught us on so many levels.

I once came across a blind person in a shopping centre who was lost. He asked for directions and I proceeded to give him ‘directions for the blind’ as in talking about when you get to this wall turn right, then keep going till there’s a shop with about a million customers and smells like soap etc - but at the end I said ‘or I can give you my elbow and take you if you’d prefer’. 

Apparently I was one of few people who he had ever encountered who had actually tried to give him directions but navigating the world as if it was Pac-Man wasn’t his preferred way of getting about and it’d be much easier if I could just take him 😂

Went to the ER, just to have the male nurse and then male physician both ask if I was on my period 😣 they did no testing at the ER, sent me home with pain meds.

There’s always exceptions to the rule, I tend to stay away from British Columbia oysters.

It’s worth noting that out of the >100 species of vibrio out there, only a dozen or so infect humans.

Furthermore, [per the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/faq.html): there are roughly 80,000 cases of vibrio in the US each year (52,000 coming from food), with 80% of those infections coming between May-October and 100 deaths result from vibriosis each year.  For arguments sake let’s pretend that people don’t die from vibrio-infected cuts and all 100 deaths are from contaminated oysters; this means there is a 0.19% chance of dying if you get sick from eating raw oysters (in reality this number is lower because people do die from vibrio-infected cuts).  According to the national safety council you have a similar chance of dying in a pedestrian incident and an order of magnitude higher chance of dying in a car crash or a fall, 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively.  The odds are much more sketchy if you happen to be unlucky enough to get *V. Vulfinicus*, as you did…but the data supports these are no where near the majority of infections.

I’ll take my chance on eating oysters in the winter and I don’t think your parents were off-base to allow you to eat them…as long as it wasn’t in the summertime 😎 or from a southern locale like Mexico…

16wp3e1,"Right up close to the top of the list of stupidest things I have ever done-

It was an unseasonably warm spring in New England, we were out for spring break, last week of march. This was 1986 or 87. I want to say 3rd grade, maybe 4th. Most of us learned how to swim before we learned how to walk, and *all* of us knew how to sail, row, swim in riptides & undertows, etc etc etc. We were *beachrats*. Dumb af, too, and this is why- did I mention it was unseasonably warm?

75° in New England in March at the time.... You might as well be in Death Valley. Unless you are in the water... And like the dumbasses we are/were, we all agreed this was a fantastic idea, because not only would we go swimming but we would also achieve the Holy Grail in a Beach town of being ""first in the water"" that year. Ifykyk. We didn't care that we were having snow days up until 2 weeks ago. 

We headed down to the beach and there was 3 of us. No one wanted to be first and no one definitely wanted to be last, so we agreed to all three jump at the same time, and we did. 

Like to died... I wish there was any experience that I could relate that could communicate exactly what the sensation felt like of jumping from unseasonably warm air into angry saltwater that was only a couple of degrees above freezing. It was almost like being electrocuted and hit by a bus at the same time. Body stops working, arms and legs suddenly lose about 75% of function and strength. Out of breath? No worries because you can't breath because your chest muscles lock up. 40 years later and I still wonder how the fuck we managed to get out of the water... But when we did, all three of us were hypothermic and blue, and we weren't in that water for maybe 45 seconds. 

We were laying on the Rocks shaking and crying and just trying to absorb some sunlight and heat when the bartender of the local pub that was across the street from the beach came running out cussing us like dogs, saying how stupid we were and that we probably should have just stayed in the water and done Humanity a favor 😂",2023-10-01 10:21:23

My only regret wasn’t putting him to rest a few days sooner when he wasn’t in so much pain. I feel guilt that his last day was in so much pain. It was hard! I love him and didn’t want to say bye! And he was so alert and attentive I thought “he’d want me to keep him” also I didn’t feel like I should know it’s his time. He was my first dog and I’m 24, so like I don’t feel fully mature to decide the fate of another living being. They tested his cortisol and he was max stressed. I love my dog but I wish I let him go when he felt better. 


His name is Creeper! He is so handsome! I miss him! He is my best friend and he was always a good boy😭😞

As for tips,  well tomahawk steaks are trendy nonsense 😋

Chuck Eye steaks are poor man's ribeye, taste just like ribeye but half the price! Make sure its 'Chuck Eye Steak' Not 'Chuck steak'. Big difference. 

Top Sirloin Strip steak is poor man's NY Strip. Same sort of thing,  identical in taste and marbling,  half the price.

14smq2h,"Here to say - this is a thing. The way I look in photos has always given me a complex but the sheer bafflement of family and friends (and occasional laughter) has been reassuring. It just happens with some of us 🤷‍♀️ 

I’ve never had the ‘standard hot girl’ thing going on, even if I was photogenic I wouldn’t fit the insta model mould but guess I’m quite striking and I have been told multiple times I am the exact image of Francoise Hardy. When I discovered her, I posted a photo of her on my Instagram and had so many comments saying how stylish I looked, ha. Anyway, that confirmed it for me. If my price for being unphotogenic is looking like the coolest French 60’s girl then it’s a trade off I’m willing to accept. The camera really does lie. For those with my affliction I’d recommend a combination of FaceApp and you’re most brutally honest friend who will tell you when you’ve gone too far.",2023-07-07 22:14:01

They are my best photos, I just look like shit no matter what. Sometimes I find flipping them horizontally helps because that’s how I’m used to ‘seeing’ myself in mirrors and such, but to other people that doesn’t really make a difference. My face just doesn’t translate well to photographs, but I’m decent looking in real life 🤷‍♂️

A few things I have found - I look better on my left side, having the camera angled under my face slightly works well for me and good lighting makes all the difference. Also, moisturise, use SPF and I like to also use a serum by l’oréal that contains a light tint to it that evens out my complexion.

14smq2h,"Alongside the other nice explanations of everyone, I'll add my stone to the monument: pictures doesn't please the brain, as they're still images.

Everyone's faces you've seen in real life were subject to the immediate flow of time. Human faces have extremely subtle twitches, movements, a sort of moving organic compound to it. Our brains evolved over hundreds of millenias around constantly moving facial features: even someone trying to have the most still face will have those subtle movements that our brains pick up. 

Pictures are a whole next level of that: it is truly frozen in time. Exit those tiny twitches, movements, alongside what OP said (loss of 3D perspective, for example), and suddenly the picture looks less appealing than the real counterpart of the face. Your consciousness will pick up the fact that it's a face, but your subconsciousness still has some levels of objections, while it also sees a face. 

Add up to that the fact that a lot of people have some level of insecurities regarding the face, and you get that widespread feeling that our faces look less nice in pictures, when the truth is that y'all have beautiful faces ❤",2023-07-07 14:04:59

My friend told me it’d take about an hour to start working so I had a drink at the party. I sat on the couch when I started feeling it. My friend was wearing an Afro wig and there was like disco balls and laser lights. I looked down at my hand on the couch and I was becoming the couch! He looked at me and said, “it’s a good high?” I was like “no! I’m the couch”! I crawled to the bathroom and laid on cold tiles, got sick so they took me to lay in the bed-to sleep it off. I was fine as long as it was cool, dark, silent and still. Every time someone would come check on me I felt like I was floating through space and got motion sickness. I started puking 🤮 and it was like the scene from the exorcist NO LIE! We left the party and had to take the comforter covered in vomit with us-while the home owner, my friends, friend, had to clean her entire room! I threw up out the car window on the way home. When we stopped for gas I stood on the side of the road like a statue for like 10 minutes-unmoving!

jicp9n,So let's talk about ecstasy and grapefruit 🤔,2020-10-26 14:23:07
jicp9n,"Pharmacists will put a sticker on these medications if the drug is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (which grapefruit, as well as other medications and juices like pomegranate inhibit). Edit: CYP-3A4 stands for cytochrome p-450 with the 3A4 being the specific designation (eg. There are other CYPs like 2D6 and 1A2 which also handle lots of drugs but 3A4 metabolizes approximately 50% of drugs on the market).

So if the enzyme that breaks the drug down is inhibited it makes it so the drug can reach much higher levels of concentration than originally planned.

Grapefruit and CYP3A4 are just the most common and some of the most dangerous interactions. 

CYPs are wild! Hopefully we can study them more easier someday because people can naturally be hyper metabolizers or under metabolizers for a number of different CYPs.

jicp9n,"Absolutely, though I’d just recommend a lower dosage—it helps greatly with the undesired effects that come with ingestion (the mushrooms contain some indigestible parts that simply make it a little tougher on the gut when they drop from your stomach into your large intestine).  What’s great about lemon tekking (slang for “technique”) is that it allows for very quick onset, taking care of the waiting an hour or so and thinking, “did I take enough?”.

I believe the main hesitation I might be detecting is apprehension rooted more in the ambiguity of an unexplored substance?  If this is the case, please know that while mushrooms can certainly take you to far, far away places, the trips are quite giggly and pleasant for the most part, and are generally much more grounded in ‘compassion’, if you’d believe it.  There’s a reason the saying amongst the community is “mush love”.

While you can lose your mind and go to very dark places with bad trips on LSD, mushrooms tend to force you to confront yourself, rather than outside or unknown fears.  As long as you remember that nothing that couldn’t harm you, previously, can harm you now, faith in the shrooms guiding you through should be all you need to navigate.

And on the other side of that experience is the ‘therapy’ many speak of, in regards to this.

As Tame Impala says, “if it calls you—embrace it.  If it haunts you—face it”

Answer their questions as best as you can, this helps them figure out what the issue is, even if the person is unresponsive. They will tell you how to find the correct spot to do compressions, encourage you to use force (breaking ribs is ok, those can heal. Death is pretty permanent), and help you with timing compressions. 

Training for operators can vary state to state, but they are all very knowledgeable and experienced with how to instruct callers to do whatever they’re willing to do to preserve life ❤️",2021-05-02 23:26:32

n36z7e,"If they have clear signs of lividity or pooling of blood, it’s a confirmation sign of death and you wouldn’t start CPR so even if you HAD more training, nothing would have changed, they were done. You did your best. I would encourage you to speak with someone if it’s still affecting you. The weirdest things can set people off, but you had absolutely no impact on this scenario, since they were already dead. For what it’s worth, I’m a control freak and when I obsess about something that didn’t go ideally, I have to double back and ask myself why this one thing is what my brain is focusing on. It’s usually the safest option because I COULDNT have changed the outcome. If I obsessed over something I might truly regret, maybe I would spiral down a bit. PTSD is a real thing and lots of people have it, and there is no quantitative measure on what “counts” or doesn’t. I’ve buried family members, coworkers, soldiers, and been to some awful firefighter funerals because they couldn’t take it anymore. There are great resources out there if you get hurt saving someone, but there are resources if you are struggling. FWIW, I get that you work in a hotel, this is just for whomever needed to hear it. 😉

TLDR: if a call or something is still haunting you long after, please talk to someone. We bury too many responders and soldiers who just try to stuff their feelings and regrets and pain and eventually snap. Please take care of you/talk to someone! 💜",2021-05-03 04:07:42

My autistic daughter is non verbal so I get it. You have to ask yourself what makes the behavior “undesired”. Stimming for example is a big one I’ve seen “corrected” and that’s a really important thing for a lot of autistic people. 


In referencing the “autism mom” thing- a lot of parents like to wear it as a badge that they can gain some type of sympathy or respect from-like raising an autistic human should come with some social reward-then when accompanied by an autism speaks sticker on the back of their minivan doesn’t really shout that you actually support autistic people. I’ve also seen that the autism community prefers autistic person vs. person with autism because that implies that autism is something you can get or catch or can be cured and none of those are true. 

These are just a few long winded things. Try and widen your exposure to allow some autistic adults /teens in, I’m sure it can only benefit you and your child! ☺️",2022-04-01 10:06:33

I can absolutely understand wanting a cure in this instance. 

And yes thank you! I am only 20, an age in my country where alcohol is pretty much the basis for all social activities. So it would have been an easy thing for me to continue on that journey and never stop I suppose, but I'm grateful I was able to realise I don't like drinking or socializing (in that way).

If someone texted us a paragraph bigger than that resulting in us not receiving it but they don’t know that that’s the reason why we didn’t reply or asked if there were still there they’ll assume we just didn’t care or didn’t bother replying to them.

d7cpm3,"Be real about your experiences. Working multiple jobs at once or working while in school means you’re able to keep an organized schedule. Gas station attendants develop customer service skills. Temp jobs mean you’ve worked in multiple office cultures & might mean you’ve had to learn systems or processes quickly. How well do you get along with coworkers? What types of skills have you been developing? Did you ever have a bad situation that taught you an important lesson? Usually, the next job isn’t such a jump that the last one is irrelevant, so just be honest about your experiences. When I interview for entry level positions, I don’t care that the person pumped gas or sold bras. I care that they’re being respectful, honest, & kind. I care that selling fries taught them how to relate to the guy who was counting pennies & crying because he wasn’t sure he had enough to eat. I care that pumping gas taught you how to give top-tier customer service to difficult people. If you’re not sure what those qualities are for you, talk to someone who knows you & can help you see your good sides. Just don’t sell yourself short- there are valuable skills learned in the jobs you mentioned. 🙂

I was called out one night around 11 or 12 to tow a few vehicles.  Turned out they were parked in front of their own homes and the property manager wanted to teach them a lesson.

I went off on him because there was a truck and trailer combo that was clearly a work truck that would be needed in the morning with a trailer full of tools, so I took my time and called in to ""double check"" that I could tow both at once (they were connected) hoping they would come outside and he tells me I can just rattle chains and scare them if I want.

First, I don't get paid if I don't complete a tow at night. Second, he got me out of bed for this. Third, the guy clearly would need this stuff for work in the morning and it was in front of his own house.

So they come outside and he starts telling them they owe me money and I said they don't owe me anything because I didn't do anything, that if anyone owed me money it was him for wasting my time.

He was in town from another state because he oversees various properties apparently and likes to do this to teach people a lesson 🙄

I told him not to ever call us at night like this again.

Last night one of our guys went to an apartment complex twice and the people parked in the spot next to their own spot, so he contacted management both times to get them to call the tenant and give them the chance to move their cars.

He didn't get paid for that time, he just did it.

It was my fault; I typed out the whole thing but deleted it because yay anxiety tangents 😂 the gist was poor communication and my anxiety getting the best of me. It wasn’t helped by having had a very stressful week and I throw myself into deep cleaning and closing myself off from people when I’m really stressed. 

We talked it out and we’re good now but it took me until well into the next day to recover from the anxiety of that mild conflict and I kept apologizing and he kept reassuring me we’re okay. I kept feeling like I was going to cry when he told me we were okay, partially out of a vague feeling of distrust, but that’s my own baggage. 

I didn’t really start feeling a little better about things until he thanked me for initiating the slightly uncomfortable conversation and talking it out with him and I thanked him for being open and honest with me. It helps a lot more than me anxiously repeating apologies.",2023-04-30 21:02:42

133yn9g,"Yes it comes from my parents. I was yelled at for things I didn't think I was doing wrong. It felt like I couldn't really do anything right because I got in trouble for every little thing. So that led to a lot of anxiety in adulthood of constantly feeling like I can get in trouble at anytime for misspeaking or being clumsy (which probably stems from the anxiety itself now I think about it) or not doing something perfectly. I have been trying not to say anything. It kind of leaves me feeling awkward and still doesn't really take away the I've done something wrong feeling. Kind of feels worse because now I feel guilty and like I'm just staying silent knowing I've done wrong.

What it did was make me less risk-averse. In H2H situations, such as merging, if I was in the correct lane already and some ass tried barging in from the outside lane, I wouldn't necessarily ease up to let them in. I couldn't lose this game of chicken if I had evidence showing I did nothing wrong, yeah?

Yeh, a dash cam still doesn't stop the 18-month process of getting a claim settled for the damage or the increase in the premium. A tap of the brakes could have avoided all that.

>It was more of a I know I'm on camera now and I know it's recording

Ok, so I'm gonna let you in on a not so subtle secret with a lot of dash cam models. I used to work in a place that sold _lots_ of them, and in whipping up marketing materials, theres a feature touted on some that if you know computers, makes zero sense.

It's called One-Touch Format, and is supposedly used to _""Make your SD card last longer, by occasionally refreshing it and clearing up files""_. The thing about flash memory is that formatting it will reduce the lifespan, not increase it. Even if it did work, why isn't it just some function buried in the settings menu? Why One Touch?

Yep, that's a _""Wipe the evidence""_ button, designed for super quick access should you do something in the wrong 🤫

On that note, check your SD card every 3 months. Not all models alert you to a corrupted card. That nearly cost me on one occasion, but thankfully the other party admitted fault. Buy 2 SD cards, and just swap them every couple of months, checking the footage on the one you took out to confirm its still working.

Also, I found setting the clip length to its max value (usually 5 mins) beneficial to lifespan.

Feel free to ask me anything. Its been a few years since I worked with them directly, but I've got a bit of knowledge I'm more than happy to share",2023-01-13 02:12:33

I do not simply have a transaction with a human being, I have an intimate discussion that sometimes can take as little as three or four minutes. This also usually leaves the people in the line behind me smiling and joining in the conversation as well.

(original comment follows) 

=

Gonna give some specific examples of things my ex convinced me were ""bad"" and why, in case it helps anyone. Hidden parts are about sexual abuse. 

1. asking what they want (""not paying enough attention"")

2. not asking what they want (""not caring"") 

3. trying to make plans with them (""irresponsible"" for keeping them away from more 'productive' things than spending time with me) 

4. making plans without them (""not being there for me"")

5. canceling plans for any reason (""unreliable"")

6. changing my mind when they didn't want me to (""untrustworthy"")

7. not changing my mind when they want me to (""stubborn"") 

8. asking other people for relationship advice (""going behind my back"")

9. trying to talk to them about the relationship (""blaming me for your own issues"") 

10. not being able to argue my case effectively while upset (""you don't even have a good reason"")

11. leaving to calm down during arguments (""immature"" and ""running away from your problems"") 

12. not knowing how to do things (""stupid"")

13. asking them to teach me how to do things (""inconsiderate and lazy"") 

14. doing things too slowly (""using incompetence as an excuse to sit here and daydream"") 

15. doing things too quickly (""half-assing it"")

16. doing literally exactly what they told me to do (""smart-ass"")  (I'm autistic)

17. spending time/energy/money on anything they haven't explicitly asked me to do (""irresponsible"")

18. using my opportunity to ask for things (birthday, 'my turn' to pick the movie, etc) to ask for what I wanted instead of what they wanted (""loving someone means putting their needs first"")

19. being upset by anything they said/did (""selfish, irrational"")  

20. telling them I don't like something they said/did (""guilt tripping"")

21. trying to be OK with something they said/did when I'm not (""lying"")

22. thinking about questions before answering them (""stalling"" and/or ""if you cared then you should've answered immediately"")

23. wanting enough bedrooms for each kid to have their own (""selfish and wasteful"") 

24. not wanting my kids to be in dangerous sports (""disrespecting my culture"")

25. asking them to do *some of* the housework (""disrespecting my culture"") 

26. knowing my limits (""making excuses"")

27. trying to do things knowing I would fail at them (""wasting time,"" ""unreliable"")

28. >!not wanting to have sex when it was physically painful!< (""unloving,"" and also ""immature"" because I liked video games but not >!searing pain in my genitals!<????)

29. >!not moaning loudly enough during the sex I didn't want!< (""selfish"") (also, super fun being slut shamed by my family for it after 🙃) 

30. >!getting distracted during sex!< (""selfish and inattentive"")

31. >!not sexually abusing animals with him!< (""close-minded and boring"")

32. showing interest in someone else, in a relationship that was open because *they* wanted it open (""am I not enough for you?"")

33. not dropping everything I'm doing to make them feel better when they had a bad day (""unloving"")

34. asking for clarification when they contradict themselves (""putting words in my mouth"")

35. bringing up that happened in the past and were never resolved (""holding a grudge"")

36. offering advice (""I know what I'm doing"")

=

Edit: Wanted to add a couple things really quick.

First, many abusive people have trauma, mental illness, a rough upbringing, etc. and will use that to justify their crap, and act like ""holding those things against them"" makes YOU the bad person. **Protecting yourself is not holding those things against them. You're holding *their actions* against them.** (That is, if you want to see it as holding anything against anyone.)

Second: I put it at the top because it's important.

Edit #2: added a few more to the list",2022-08-21 20:09:18
wu349y,"This is very true. 

I grew up with an emotionally abusive father who was also an alcoholic. It resulted in me constantly feeling guilty for wanting to feel safe, which wasn't in his presence. I was dealing with a double-edged sword of sorts, to say the the least. 

This escalated to the point that despite me being relieved when he left, I still felt some degree of guilt and responsibility for *his decision*. Months of therapy helped me realize that it was his decision and that there was no reason for me to feel bad. 

I think it is worth mentioning that what abusers pick up on is why the victims *always* feel like they're attracting abusers when it's the opposite. 

I had this happen to me while studying abroad in college. Rich white entitled girl who clearly has no grasp of culture tried to rope me into being a fun party girl with her. Given my own history, I would constantly turn it down. 
This turned into her trying to get me to confess what I thought she was (which was my abusive alcoholic dad), berating me for 'airing dirty laundry' and trying to shift blame, trying to ship me with one of the study abroad directors, calling me all the names in the book when I said something she said to someone else when I wasn't 'supposed to,' and peer pressuring me into drinking *despite* me explaining my fears of drinking while we were hanging with a group of other study abroad students. (Not all at the same time but throughout in roughly that order to name a few.)
I would watch her go through this constant cycle of trying to find a way to tear me down only to just get progressively more pissed when everyone sided with me. Dude I wasn't even trying💀 I was just trying to make the most out of my experience like chill. 

Thankfully I'm so nerdy that I just drowned myself in my classes and internship to avoid her as much as possible. I'm still needing hella therapy for the academic escapism since that does not slide by in graduate/professional school. It's one of those, ""It helped me then, but I definitely need to unlearn it for my overall well being.

I left several hours early for my flight and had to part ways with my precious señora (who this girl also disrespected btw by constantly being a slob with her room, rejecting basically anything the señora made and going through bulimic episodes with dinner that our señora prepared early when she would be away for the evening). Did I mention I was roommates with this girl? No wonder I prefer living alone now. 

Yes, she has been blocked. I did it after coming back from studying abroad and STILL debated it because of survivor's guilt(?). When I did it was the most liberating experience, but it kinda set the path for my hitting rock bottom (oof) and seeking therapy in an effort to better myself and avoid these kinds of situations again (yay).

So uh, yeah. Thank for tuning in to my rant, I guess? I'll definitely have to save this for my own future therapy sessions.",2022-08-22 00:41:40

wu349y,"See heres the thing with this advise. (It is brilliant and I think is how I approach my work)

In WoW/LoL/Overwatch/Dota/Darkest Dungeon/FFxiv/Mass Effect/Dragon Age/Cuphead etc. I can look at the start of the game and then look at my current save file and SEE the difference, SEE the progress. I can then look at what the next step is in my journey and know in a very concrete way what I need to be working on. I can go online and research all of the stuff I need to in my own time. I think probably my favourite thing is stuff like WoW Class Forums where they are constantly talking and discussing how to play their class. I can litterally just watch the conversation happen to see some of the mistakes I can try to fix.

In real life everything is happening at once. You can't tell someone you are abusing ""this issue in my personality, that is causing problems between us, will be worked on and fixed after I have finished fixing these other X issues...

5c61yw,"Thank you so much, I've been utterly dismayed about this and have been struggling to articulate my concerns effectively with people saying ""it won't be so bad, don't worry that was just a show.""  I couldn't agree with you more.  My purpose in life was to fight and defeat climate change, no one seems to care over these past 6 years; this election was like a nuke that's destroyed my life's purpose and almost guarantees that my children and theirs will live in a world vastly different than ours, will face extreme challenges in almost every aspect of life, and will no doubt be questioning what in the fuck we were thinking and how could we willfully throw it all away.  

The greatest generation was absolutely and terrifyingly correct about the baby boomers, with this last move they have literally guaranteed world destruction on an unprecedented level.

My only hope is that this will be the final straw that finally motivates people towards real progress.  I'm not very confident that'll be the case anymore...

d5qh3a,Hey OP I’ve been cutting my toenails wrong my whole life and never had a problem. Is there a weird reason behind this? Also I only cut my big toe—the rest I’m able to just do with my hands 🤷🏻‍♀️,2019-09-18 10:52:24
d5qh3a,My toe nails grow round naturally. If I get a pedicure and am not paying attention and the pedicurist cuts straight across I get ingrown toenails. 🤔,2019-09-18 04:54:32
d5qh3a,"Oh man, NOW you tell me 😒",2019-09-18 09:02:24
d5qh3a,I started cutting curved because they were growing inwardly 🤷🏼‍♀️,2019-09-18 18:01:47
d5qh3a,My Left big toe went under the lawn mower while I was mowing the lawn. It cleaned the whole nail off. It took 6 months for the nail to grow back but it is weirdly shaped. The sides digs into my toe and I’ve been walking around with constant pain for the last 9 months. It is so infected that I think I’m immune to sepsis. 😂,2019-09-18 06:53:00
d5qh3a,As a nursing student this demonstrates my life 😂,2019-09-18 03:06:07

d5qh3a,That’s what I was thinking. It may be healthier but it certainly doesn’t look as nice on feet if the nail just goes straight across. 😂,2019-09-18 05:03:03
d5qh3a,It’s just hard because I’ve only ever done it the incorrect way and convinced myself it looks and feels more hygienic. Thanks for the free advice  👍🏼,2019-09-18 05:04:27
d5qh3a,"That’s great and I understand what you’re saying. But the majority of the patients we see report it’s uncomfortable, but definitely not extreme pain. I usually do up to 6 of these procedures each week. We also use a freezing spray to numb the toe even before the injections, particularly with younger patients that are nervous (it is always the grown men with tattoos that make the most fuss though😂)",2019-09-18 12:14:02
d5qh3a,😅😅who fucking knows. It definitely gets rid of them for months so probably not.,2019-09-18 09:09:14

d5qh3a,"Thank you! I am all better now. The doc that treated me said the same thing you posted - been using a toe nail clipper that looks like a cuticle trimmer, so it’s been fine since the.

129q75s,"Completely agree. As someone fooled by fancy and cute advertising, I can 100% say that owning a rabbit was one of the biggest mistakes I’ve ever made. Rabbits need constant attention and a rather large space to live in. They can’t be cooped up in a tiny cage all day, which most people probably won’t care about if they have one, which will lead to neglect of the animal, at best. 

On top of that they shit at absolutely all hours of the day. And it’s not in a nice little pile like dog’s either. It comes out as pellets that get EVERYWHERE, and can be incredibly difficult to spot if you have decently thick carpet. Also, if they’re left out they WILL eat any paper you have lying on the bottom shelf or within reach, this includes wallpaper. 

Rabbits are very high care animals, and a lot of research should go into what you need and how to care for one before you get one, especially to avoid giving them heart attacks. No matter what I don’t think a young child can legitimately be expected to take proper care of a rabbit. They’re very amazing animals if you know how to care for them, but yea, a bunch of people underestimate the sort of undertaking they really are. Keep loving rabbits, but love them from a distance if you don’t know what you’re doing!🐇",2023-04-02 16:50:28
129q75s,"When I was about 6-7 years old in the early 90s, my family bought each of the cousins a chick each for our Easter egg hunt. All has been wiped from my memory except the moment I 100% cheated by looking out the upstairs window as my younger cousins got a head start on the hunt.

My mom says I carried that chick, then chicken, around for months..I LOVED it. Then it started trying to peck my eyes out (reflections) so she killed it and we ate it for dinner. 😂",2023-04-02 23:58:00
129q75s,"Are the wild ones like this, or is this unique to domestic ones. Because randomly stopping eating and dying, or dropping dead when they get stressed sounds like *really* poor evolutionary strategies imho 😅",2023-04-03 10:21:24
129q75s,"You can litter box train them. Mine free roams the entire house and only poops/pees in her litter box 💀 but I also did my research and was very patient with her. And if you give them enough chew toys, they will not (always) seek out wallpaper lol",2023-04-02 18:15:56

129q75s,"Oh I didn't mean to make it sound like chickens are terrible pets, not at all! I like chickens and taking care of them. They're cool birds. My ex boyfriend had like 15 hens and I loved getting stuff for them like kale, cantaloupes, watermelons and all kinds of fruits and veggies. He didn't really seem to think it was necessary to give them that stuff but I insisted because I knew that with a highly varied diet they would recover better from being kept in battery cages before he got them. They quickly figured out I was the one with the yummy goodies like apples and cabbage and they'd run up to me every time I showed up with a grocery bag. I made them birdie bread with the powdered eggshells he'd save for me and those girls got fully feathered out again within a few months. 

I'd love to have a couple of hens now but this neighborhood has a strict no livestock rule, which kinda pisses me off because hens don't make a lot of noise. Not like all 8 million of the dogs in here. That a lot of people just let run loose. 🙄

Chickens are actually really cool pets, I just hate the way people will go buy a couple of chicks for their kids as a surprise Easter gift and then they get neglected or tossed aside once they start growing out of the fuzzy little chick stage. That makes me mad, because they can live to be 10 years old or more.",2023-04-03 21:12:44

She was a 3lb Polish who was the boss of our 19lb dog (both adopted, but bun was with us first and if they hadn’t gotten along, we would have brought the dog back to the rescue. Thankfully they did!). 

She’d get her pellets in the morning and every morning around 6, she’d jump up on the bed and then to my pillow. She’d snuffle my hair, then nudge. If I didn’t do anything, nudge. Then NUDGE. If I STILL didn’t do anything, she’d grab a clump of hair near my scalp and YANK. 🤣 Then hop down and excitedly figure-8 around my legs as I got her damn breakfast.",2023-04-03 10:56:27

coeves,"If you can’t find the switch which is usually behind the fans or next to it. 

Just take some cardboard boxes and break them up flat and put it up against the coil which is behind the fans. The fans draw air across the coil, so that will stop airflow across the coil which will stop heat transfer with the refrigerant. 

Will be a lot easier then trying to break the fanguard to get to the fans themselves. 

Cause unless you got a 1/2” wrench on you you’re not getting those fan guards off.

I prefer to be by myself... something somethin.... yeah with nobody else...😎😎😎🎼🎸🎷😎,2022-07-20 01:09:46
w2k1e2,"Oh no, she was crystal clear - she thinks I'm not strict enough with the kids and that I ""just want to be their friend."" She particularly objects to the fact that I let them have toys on their desks.

We teach kids with severe behavior disorders - autism, histories of trauma, and in some cases real organic mental illness. Making personal connections and providing a safe, consistent environment is absolutely crucial. But she thinks if I just yell at them more, they'll magically be ready to rejoin the general population.

I will never understand why so many people want to spend their days screaming at kids. It hurts my throat and accomplishes nothing. The only time I do it is when a kid deliberately hurts another kid, and I've genuinely lost my shit.

The only time I was injured this year was when I was trying to calm a student and take away a broken ruler that he was hitting other kids and furniture with. She decided I was being too soft and made a grab for the ruler. He pulled it away and in the process sliced my hand open.

I Just realized this might be more of an answer to the question ""why do I hate her?"" 😂

ETA: Rereading this, I guess she hates me because she thinks if I were stricter, I could make the kids be quiet and sit still, thus making her job easier. But I'm just a lazy people-pleaser, so she has to do all the hard work of ""making them behave"". (She doesn't do shit.)",2022-07-30 04:24:32
yfmzuc,"Last year my wife and I decided on a long weekend to take the ~hour flight from Seoul to Jeju, Korea’s largest island which is also rather tropical. But a pretty heavy rainstorm had rolled in and our flight started getting thrown about. You could feel the fuselage turn and the turbulence was enough that I was getting a little airtime off my seat with the drops(or that’s what it “felt like” at the time).

I’ve flown quite a bit over the years as I used to fly weekly for work, and I’d never been on a flight that truly made me consider dying while flying. That flight changed my mind. We tried landing five times and had to abort on all of them because of wind shear. The biggest problem was that after circling so much we didn’t have the fuel to make it back to Seoul. 

So we had to land on some little landing strip island where things weren’t so bad, they only had enough fuel for us to make a couple more attempts on the big island, but not to get back to Seoul. On the 8th try, we finally landed and even the cabin crew were clapping. We were the last flight in or out for the next day. That experience will never leave me, I was absolutely terrified 😅",2022-10-28 15:08:32

I spent my teenage years using shitty “all natural” deodorants because I didn’t yet realize it was the stupid antiperspirant and not the deodorant that was the issue 🙈 
Another issue is that deodorant WITHOUT antiperspirant is hard to find. In the entire length of the deodorant aisle in Walmart, only maybe 1-2 sticks have just the deodorant.

Shitty way to find out when you're growing up with shitty parents who will not buy you new shirts and even refused to buy high quality food because ""you don't need special shirts, or foods"" 😑

What finally fixed it for me was to stop using anti-perspirant. It took like a week or two to work, but something about the anti-perspirant caused my body to overproduce sweat as opposed to it just being blocked.

The third leading cause of death in America 🇺🇸. 

Do you know what that is?

It's doctors.

The 3rd highest cause of death (mortality) in the United States of America is doctors.

Look it up.

Misdiagnosis, inept dispensation of drugs, lack of patient-case oversight, surgical procedures that go wrong, anesthesia that kills, old fashioned thinking plus they have all the flaws you and I have and sometimes more.

Ever hear of the ""God Complex""? 

Egotistical practioners feel they're god-like and their views or opinions are sacrosanct.

They are not.

k5pqf3,"Thank people for pointing out they were offended by my joke 🤔 I think I shall pass and remain an asshole. No one should have to apologise simply because another person was offended by your taste in humour. You could simply say ""I had no ill intent,"" or ""I meant no harm, I have an xyz sense of humour"" then leave it at that and avoid joking around them again. To say that's gaslighting is ridiculous, you're stating that is your humour, you had no ill intent, end of conversation.

Get through 100 rejections to get that 1 vulnerable/gullible person who they can sign up. If a single call takes 5 seconds then they can do hundreds of them a day. If it takes 10 minutes that will massively hit their productivity.

xey2v7,I made the mistake of letting a scammer know I was real last week- I kept getting messages in Chinese and I know a chinese guy used to have my number (I would get legitimate confirmation texts for things like hotel bookings and flights for the dude for a bit after I changed to this number) so I figured hell maybe they actually just have this guy’s old number and said wrong number. Then they automatically started asking random questions so I realized how stupid I was to answer lol. Now I’ve been getting the damn chinese texts a few times a day for the past week💀,2022-09-15 23:36:24
xey2v7,True. I've ignored all of them when I first got my phone. I never get any spam calls anymore ✌️,2022-09-16 00:26:49

wz8uii,"To me, I think a properly trained manager is someone who is familiar with the group/organization and knows a lot about the group/organization they're serving, such as processes, POC's for various things related to your group/organization, a clear vision what your group/organization is trying to accomplish, and actually understanding the work thats trying to be done. Also, doesn't hurt if you actually know how to talk to people and be an effective communicator😄 I can't recall how many times I've had to deal with managers who didn't know how to communicate with people in general

Another thing that stands out to me is experience. Someone who's been there, worn multiple hats, and has an idea of what works and what doesn't. Someone that can differentiate what a good manger versus a bad manager looks like. It's all in the details and can really separate the two

These ""trainings"" are good and all, but they simply don't impart actual working experience in these roles for people just starting out and are being expected to take on these roles with little to no working experience.",2022-08-27 19:19:12

TLDR: the inquisitors did nothing wrong and you can’t even compare what they did to what Muslims did. You sound like a bozo because Muslims attacked southern Europe and over a dozen Christian countries in the Middle East and North Africa for 800+ years.

The ones in the Middle East. Migrants from there still show up to Europe very often with child brides, it’s been in the news a few times. The Middle East and Africa are riddled with nations that have either no age of consent or places like Nigeria with an age of consent of 11. Gtfo bozo.

vkmc2f,"We rented a car in Denver a few years back. Thankfully took a video. My cousins said there was a bad hall storm a few days before we arrived. 

After returning the car, Enterprise claimed we owed for hail damage 🤔. Even after realizing we saw dents in the video, they kept pushing and indicated they would take us to court if needed. Our insurance was awesome and didn't pay them and offered to help us legally. I pulled our location history and all weather events and showed that we were never near any damaging events throughout the trip. After months they dropped it.",2022-06-26 01:38:43
vkmc2f,"We do, but we’re only human 🤷🏼‍♀️ Stuff gets missed sometimes. We have tablets and we take pictures of all things we consider damage. There’s also definitely times that the customer doesn’t realize damage happened to the car while they had it in their possession, in which case we still have to file a claim with their insurance. We don’t make money off damages, we literally just take your collision deductible and then file a claim with your insurance. If your deductible is $0 somehow, then that’s awesome. You won’t be paying Enterprise anything. If it’s $1000, then that sucks. But that’s why we offer the damage waiver—you pay a little extra up front and you can walk away from even a totaled car and no one but you ever has to know. And you also can’t get charged with loss of use, which with how long cars are taking to get fixed, is a very real and unfortunate possibility.",2022-06-26 04:13:26

He usually sends pics of something at work (laptop etc) or his doggo. When he does send one of him it’s either he’s super depressed and fucked up or it’s him with a small smile. Any time he sends one with a smile I’ll compliment him. When he sends the sad pics I generally do my best to go hangout with him for a bit and his hair is nice almost always. Even when messy. So nice I’m actually a bit jealous of it. Lol I shit hair. Thin and useless. His is full and luxurious. Shiny. It’s nice. 😊 So, in person he gets those compliments. 

My fiancée compliments me often. I’m still getting used to that to be honest. I’ve been in many relationships before. None of them complimented me like she does. I return the favor as much as possible. She’s the best.",2023-06-15 03:06:11

gz7r8p,"You're stronger than you think you are! ☺️

Use your foot to flatten as much of it as possible, then screw the cap back on to keep the air out if it tries to pop back into shape.

Also, it's not ""all or nothing""! Even if you only flatten the most flexible part right around the middle of a two-liter bottle, you're still dramatically reducing its volume.

If you're in a place where you can't use your foot, you can still find clever ways to force out most of the air! Think about an old toothpaste tube and how you have to twist, contort, and fold the thing to get out the last bits. It's the same concept here",2020-06-09 11:04:52

It will most definitely have a huge negative affect on your teeth over time. Not only the chewing surfaces (occlusal) but the pressure on your teeth can make them crack as well, which aren't exactly ""fixable"" without spending a small fortune.

Most people at nurseries are more than happy to talk about what might make a good gift. (Adding in asking them about what would be a good low maintenance plant) You also may be able to purchase it over the phone and tell him to go pick up the surprise. Shopping local to his area also helps a lot with making sure it will live a happy life based on the weather if it becomes an outdoor plant ☺️

I had the exact opposite experience, I read it and immediately it made so much sense that I couldn't believe it hadn't occurred to me sooner. It hasnt been quite so easy to apply to life, thats been a bit of a process, but so many of the personal faults I'd had to work on, before and since, hinged on this idea that if I cant do something fully in one go, then why do it at all? I never articulated it to myself that way haha, I'd like to think the flaw would be obvious if I had, but that was the theme.

xvwaj5,"There are all different facets of life and depression can affect us in many different ways. I'm the kind of person who goes high functioning in a few areas, usually people facing, and then completely falls apart in everything else. So I'll get my laundry done and I'll do well in work or school, but I'll be just living with bedbugs in a shitty house that I don't clean and never go out or spend time with friends.

u4y5z9,"Dental assistant here - can confirm. Always recommend people use an electric toothbrush over manual as the ultrasonic pulses do most of the work and you can focus on getting your brush into those hard to reach areas (especially posterior to your last molars). Angle your bristles 45 degrees to your gums so you get a nice, sulcular clean. 15 seconds per quadrant minimum. To stimulate growth of your gingiva, you can complete the brushing with a sweep up towards the chewing surface. Google “modified bass technique”. 

The wearing of enamel at the gum line is called abfraction, and it doesn’t look or feel very nice. It can cause sensitivity, inflammation and further recession. 

Happy brushing y’all! ✌🏽♥️🦷",2022-04-16 15:40:39

u4y5z9,"You’re probably applying too much force. I really mean it that you have to apply very little pressure for the bristles to effectively clean because of the vibrations doing the work. The position of your bristles is important here too. It could be possible that you just don’t like the feeling. Or perhaps the vibrations feel weird?

Dunno. But you could also get bristles specified to your needs. 😁🦷",2022-04-16 16:55:05
u4y5z9,"You certainly can, again, if you’re brushing too hard. If you’re not making the pressure sensor go off, you’re probably fine. Make note that enamel does wear over time, regardless, with age. So to assuage the wear or slow it down, soft bristles and light pressure (w/electric brush) is optimal. You can always google brushing methods as well. ✌🏽♥️🦷",2022-04-18 17:26:04

mj5mfw,"You're welcome! It's tough trying to have relationships with people who behave this way. It's often fear and shame that drives then to a point of not being able to see how selfish they are behaving. Oftentimes, with alcoholics or even just mental illness in general, people have to hit a rock bottom. When they realize they've pushed everyone away with their terrible behavior and no one will come rescue them, they are left with no one but themselves. Some people take it much farther than others, and will drag anyone down with them and their delusions of being a victim. Stay resolute with your boundaries. When she's sober you can explain to her that her behavior is destructive and damaging to you, but she may not take it well. She will escalate her crazy to manipulate and control other people and blame them twice as hard when she's left sitting in a pile of her own shit.  Seek support for yourself to help solidify your decisions. There is /r/AlAnon , /r/codependency and many online groups for AlAnon as well. https://al-anon.org/

Take care and good luck 💜",2021-04-03 16:57:46
mj5mfw,This is so accurate. One of the reasons why my ex and i broke down in our coms was because i just needed him to hear me vent and not try to fix the issue. But he simply can't not fix anything and all i really wanted was for him to validate my feelings on that subject (and that subject itself is almost impossible to solve). I guess we both just don't get it. 🤷‍♀️,2021-04-03 14:52:50
mj5mfw,"For sure, she pulls the guilt card like “why can’t you open up to me and be supportive” and all this crap, even though I’ve helped her through her problems sOoOoO many times. I’m fucking sick of helping someone who doesn’t want to help themselves. It’s like she can’t change, but expects us to keep sitting there while she bitches about her life.

To clarify, she’s great when she’s sober and I love her a lot, but it’s just her drinking that makes her emotional and turns into a wreck that keeps pushing me away from her in a way. She’s gotten somewhat better recently, but still does the sappy emotional guilt trip shit. She did this two Christmas’ ago, pulled me aside and started this bullshit, and got mad when I told her I can’t do this and walked away. She makes ME feel bad by not wanting to be her constant therapist. Same with my brother.

I have told her about her behaviour when sober. She nods, says sorry and understands but still doesn’t change.

I've been in a similar boat as a veterinarian, and it's true that so many patients/clients feel that they're being given the short end of the stick if you don't give them *something*, even if you explain your reasoning for not doing so until you're blue in the face. Antibiotic resistance is a *very* serious and ever-growing problem, and it's only going to get worse as we run out of novel antibiotics to place on the front lines of medicine.

11rjiep,"My Dad and Son seem to have this. When they laugh, they'll suddenly lapse into a coughing fit that may last for a few seconds to longer. The coughs do seem to be unproductive. Best we check into this to find out and find a solution 🥺",2023-03-15 03:26:48
11rjiep,"Yeah I have asthma but never wheeze, just cough a lot and have trouble taking full breaths. I was diagnosed as a kid but my parents didn’t get me an inhaler or anything because I didn’t wheeze or “sound asthmatic”, so I didn’t get my asthma treated until adulthood 🙃",2023-03-15 13:15:36
11rjiep,Thank you! I’m sure I have it and would like to be diagnosed. Laughing hard makes me feel asthmatic or running too hard. It makes it hard to breathe and I have to cough and spit up stuff 🤢,2023-03-15 18:08:26
11rjiep,"Yes. This is me. Ever since I was a child, I had a year-round cough that would not go away. Not a terrible hacking cough, just a very light one. I would always clear my throat too. My parents and doctors tried everything to figure out what it was, but no meds would help and no one knew what it was. I had never had an asthma attack before (still havent) so we never thought it could be asthma. My mother is a nurse, so she after many years and coming across modern studies and articles, connected the dots that it might be an asthma-related cough. My old doctor said QVAR could help with the cough, and I started taking it two puffs twice a day. It really helped, my cough would actually go away, and even stay away after using it for a while and then stopping my usage. It would only come back when I got sick, and linger until I used it regularly again. The old doctor was thinking asthma, but I didn’t believe that. 

Then, in late high school/early college, we went to an asthma specialist. Who almost certainly thought I had asthma, and after doing the breathing tests, confirmed I had asthma. I refused to believe it personally, I don’t know why but I just thought that having asthma had a stigma, a bad mark. I love to be active, and I didn’t want to accept I had something that could debilitate my athletic ability, especially since I had *never had anything along the lines of a traditional asthma attack before*. The doctor further prescribed me Albuterol along with QVAR. I since understand, and now do accept that I most definitely have asthma. I have an asthma-related cough and weaker airways and breathing power than normal. I’ve still never had an attack to this day, I’m about to turn 26 now. But I like to keep it that way. And from what I’ve heard about how all the coughing/clearing of my throat I do when I don’t keep up my QVAR and Albuterol can really do damage to my lungs, my breathing power, my lung capacity, and my vocal chords later in life, and how I definitely have the potential to develop susceptibility to asthma attacks later in life, I really take it more seriously! 

I am supposed to take two puffs each of Albuterol and QVAR twice a day. I generally just use it as needed whenever I develop a cough after a cold. Also, there were studies I saw during the height of the pandemic studying QVAR and Albuterol and their ability to help prevent and/or aid in the recovery of COVID. I haven’t looked into it for a long while, but I believe the general consensus was it definitely helps keep your airways and lungs much more resilient to the effects of COVID if you are actively using them, especially since asthma can lead to severe COVID effects. I’ve gotten Covid multiple times and they were rather mild in terms of the breathing symptoms. and I’m very thankful I had access to these inhalers (and got vaccinated). If I didn’t, I bet it would have been *way* worse for me. I don’t ever want to be unable to be as active as I love to be. 

Although I can definitely still be pretty lazy using my inhalers here and there 😅",2023-03-15 18:16:27

11rjiep,"I came here to say this too. I have acid reflux that I didn't think was bothering me too much (cutvout trigger foods, no heartburn or indigestion bouts often), but I also had this dry, barking cough. 

Then I learned about silent reflux. 

I take nightly pepcid, and within a week of starting, the cough was gone. Voice sounds better too. 

Game changer.

I do have exercise induced asthma though 😔",2023-03-15 08:31:17

11rjiep,So sorry 😞,2023-03-16 00:05:59
11rjiep,"Yep - that’s usually how mine presents, and it’s usually due to high allergies. As long as I take antihistamines and have my inhaler, and avoid humidity.mold, I seem to do ok. But if anything changes back I go to coughing fits. When I finally got into a pulmonologist and they had me do the breathing tests my scores were ABYSMAL. Like, the blowing out for more than 5 seconds felt impossible. But that high flow oxygen made me feel INVINCIBLE. 💪",2023-03-15 20:52:05

zwva07,“Reasonable” being the key word here. To whose standards 😥,2022-12-28 04:07:08
zwva07,"I’m sorry to hear that! To be honest I don’t have much experience in ticketing so all I can say is be polite and just see what your options are. Every airline is different but almost all airlines will have their cancellation policy on their website so feel free to have a look at what you’re entitled to before you go up to the desk (do keep in mind that sometimes people misread the airline’s website - that can be a very awkward conversation when you have to point out that someone’s research is wrong 😅).

I know pretty much all airlines will get you to your destination as soon as possible; even using other airlines’ planes if they can. We frequently rebook cancelled passengers onto our competitors’ flights since it’s important to help them get to their destination as smoothly/quickly as possible. If you are on your way back home (ie. you don’t live in the city you’ve been stuck in), a lot of airlines will offer overnight accommodation as well.

Best of luck and I hope you’re back in the air soon! 😊",2022-12-28 09:56:35
zwva07,"I think it’s super dependant on the circumstances!

Just a quick example, I just got home from work and we had to deal with a cancelled flight today. There were some people from out of town who we booked a hotel for and gave a free flight tomorrow, and others who lived here that didn’t need a hotel. Some people were happy to get to their destination tomorrow, while some had connecting flights/important meetings and didn’t want that option. So I think it definitely varies based on what you need, what you want, and what you deserve 😊

Generally cancelled flights will be a rebooking onto the next available service, a hotel for the night (only if you are from out of town), and sometimes transport to the airport. But again circumstances are different with every passenger so I definitely think different people require/deserve different compensation! 😁",2022-12-28 09:49:47

Pour a bottle of mineral oil in the drains that need water in them! It never solidifies or goes rancid, will keep the drain closed, and when you do put water down it the oil floats on top and keeps it from evaporating in the future (assuming it hasn’t all washed away)

Went for a look and saw about a HUNDRED little worms in the toilet! It was so off-putting. I poured some bleach and ran the water in each fixture for about a minute. Now I know to check it more often! 🤢,2022-01-28 20:45:05

s7ogri,"Granted.  You're not wrong. I wanted to shae based on my experience. After spending 2+ hours combing through my finances/apps/receipts brain fog had set in. The way the $44 charge is intentional placed where it is on the page, that it isn't advertised as an ""additional"" fee, as well as how small the font is + fine print in additional to the overly abundant spacing between ""Pay with Your Refund"" and ""Premium Services benefits"" with a slightly off centered ""$44""... I genuinely think  this is an additional charge that is easily missed/overlooked.   


\~\* Five Minutes Later \*\~  


The fine print:  


From TurboTaxes Checkout Page: ""Premium Services gives you Audit Defense, Full Identity Restoration, Identity Theft Insurance, and other great benefits, along with the FREE option to pay with your federal refund. Learn more""  


After clicking on the ""Learn More"" link, it seems as though in addition to allowing you to deduct all fees out of your federal refund, you also get Identity Theft Protection  and Monitoring for a year.   


I don't if it's a banking institution but more fine print states: ""TurboTax®, in partnership with TaxAudit""  


""TaxResources, Inc., dba TaxAudit, will provide the audit defense services for the tax return described on the membership certificate in return for the applicable membership fee and compliance with all applicable terms of this agreement (the “Audit Defense Plan”).  
[https://turbotax.intuit.com/corp/auditdefense-oneyear/](https://turbotax.intuit.com/corp/auditdefense-oneyear/)""

Now for the realistic perspective - not everyone working in fast food is a student. They are adults who make so little that they can't go without their pay for a single day, and getting fired could make them homeless.

tb0hr9,"Different people have completely different ideas of worth it and everyone has a different system for FEELING like they're being frugal/smart. I see it this way; if he has a fuel efficient vehicle (for instance I average 38 mpg on the streets) and only gets gas when on E, he's probably losing less than he's gaining. Wherever it's 40 cent or $3 🤷🏽‍♂️ my opinion",2022-03-11 03:45:15
tb0hr9,"If someone is stressin over a dollar or 2 due to how much time it took to get gas. They probly arnt filling up at the pump. 

The people concerned about wear n tear from god forbid driving the vehicle they spent anywhere from 10k to 50k on...probly arent driving it that much. 

And people driving cheaper pure commute cars...bought it knowing it would acrue lots of miles. Unless they are driving like a maniac then most cars can take quite a bit of standard driving and are made for it. An oil change(literally ten minutes in a driveway) is 25. Brakes are about 100. 

If your driving likea maniac then yeah those extra miles are gonna destroy your car and your wallet soooo much quicker. But a jaunt out of the way for a cheaper tank? 
If 30 bucks gets me 400 miles. But down the block i can get 400 miles for 25 bucks. I can use that LIQUID 5 dollars saved toward a filter. Or a quart of oil. 

How much time it takes. On personal vehicles...i mean...who exactly are you gonna send the bill to? ""Sky person/govt, how dare you put 3 miles between these places. Pay me my 6 dollars""
And honestly the liquid money is far more useful to you in day to day expenses then it is waitin til the end of the year ""holy crap. I saved 80 bucks that entire year by just not driving 4 extra miles"" 
I mean. Congrats. In todays economy thats...an oil change you would have had to do anyways. Two meals at applebees or olive garden. Or two 30 packs of mid level beer. 

Trust me. If your pinchin pennies that bad. Your probly not filling up and your putting your vehicle thru far worse abuse by riding it on E (in tank fuel sending units are pricier to repair then oil changes) and your probly the person(not you personally) counting exact cash and change out at the super market. 

I have been pennies poor. I get the squeeze. But really. Theres ways around the price. 

Hell i keep a motorized bycycle(250 bucks to build. No License required) around that gets 70mpg. Parts are cheap. 2.5 gallon tank. Can be assembled by a teenager with like 15 bucks in basic tools in a hour or two. Assembled they go for 600. 

And they scooot pretty well. 35 to 40 is the average speed to get around towns and cities. 

Im not saying this a personal thing to you you. But you in general. I hope i didnt come off rude 😂

Ill take the liqud money i can use that month. Because chances are im gonna put those miles on the car anyways in things other then commute and errands(going to a friends house) 

Hahahah i cant imagine charging a friend ""yo....it cost me like...7 bucks to hang out at your house today...ima need that money""

Id laugh my ass off if someone was pinchin me for the time they charge for personal stuff. 

I would have been like ""bro...next time dont even accept the invite or just say you could use a ride.. Or carpool or whatever...""

Now. If you were sacing 50 to 60 bucks a week of liquid money by it. Then yeah go for it. 
But at some point you are delving into unnatural paranoia of spending and that pile of money your acrueing will take foooorever.

""Your grandmother left you...152 bucks. And a reminder to never let a good coupon go to waste."" 

Most peoples budgets run on a monthly, or weekly basis. Yes. Lil bills stack up. That 5 bucks cover charge 3 nights out of the week? On top of club or bar food? Yeah thats actually gonna hurt you later on when your dropping close to a hundred a month on shit that coukd pay a bill that month. But...6 bucks a week you were probly gonna soend anyways on a coffee or a McDouble?",2022-03-10 21:43:25

I live in Florida, so humidity is literally the entire state all year round (even when it gets cold, the humidity makes it so hard to be comfortable). 

It’s hard to stay outside or go to an outlet mall without soaking my clothes or getting that awful sticky, wet feeling between my legs, arse cheeks, lower back, and armpits. And before anyone asks, no, I’m not overweight (but I am hairy 👹).

I started to notice that the more I time I spend outside and go outside I don’t sweat as much. I don’t know if it’s because my body is acclimating to the heat/humidity better, but it would makes sense to me if that’s the case.

Now I’m curious though: How can I be outside longer without getting the hot, sticky, wet feeling?",2023-01-11 15:29:25

108vr9k,"Well I live in India in the city of Kolkata ,previously called Calcutta.. This city had served as the capital of India way 100 yrs back..The British monarchy had ruled us for more than 300 years..Ours is a tropical climate that varies with dry-wet-humid all over the year. It is also heard that this city used to experience snowfall way back in the 1700s ..But this is another topic of discussion of climatic changes & all..Now when they had arrived in Kolkata back then,there was no problem for them as the pleasant temperature suited them..Only that the summer with high humid conditions  was unbearable for them & every year from April to October they used to shift their Capital from Calcutta to Shimla..Again reshift back to Calcutta due to extreme climatic conditions over there..As we all know Shimla experience snowfall during December..So their habits hadn't changed as they preferred to stay away from washing their body..Even during the winters they used to bathe just once or twice a week..They lacked & did not got accustomed to the Indian habits..Now, here we have the Missionaries of Charity that was established under the guidance of Mother Teresa.. So lots of students & padres visit the place quite often.. I do see them in shorts & tshirts.. I have even reciprocated with them as to with awe as I find them in same clothes during winter too when it's 10°-15°.. They all said that they are adapted to much lower temperatures than that what it's out here.. For them it's just pleasant,not too cold or chiling factors.. I can recall & equate the migration of birds during winter from Siberia.. Again I see tourists from Africa shivering during Winter here but can easily withstand temperatures during summer. That's why you would find many African players playing here with ease but western players getting exhausted & suffering heat strokes during summer.. So it's all about adaptation.. 🙂",2023-01-11 09:42:28

You're not that tuned in to distinguish the subtle behavioral distinction amongst different levels of social standing. We even speak different language when talking to a friend, best friend, older people, older siblings, teachers, etc etc. Clothing is the extension of language and direct representation of how much you respect the other party. The higher you are in social standing, the more you need to understand and practice those different approach to different people.

do9n59,"The minimal payment for the financing at my job is the interest that would be charged monthly which is never ever ever going to be close to paying off your shit in interest free time period. Even if you do double, you'll still have a balance. I encourage people to calculate payments to avoid interest since I only make money on the sale and see nothing extra the finance side sees. If you get past the interest free period, you'll add 6 or 12 months of interest on top. The biggest got ya is that we are encouraged to have them set up direct deposit in hopes they won't ever check their account to see their balance. It's just on auto pilot and the company wants to collect interest payments forever. After 3 years of on time payments, you automatically qualify for a credit increase as well as a reward for giving us thousands of dollars in interest in hopes to up your monthly interest payment. I swear, I'm so happy we have a finance department and all related grief gets pawned off on them.

Quick story. I was six and going for a ride with Dad and Bill a close family friend. We met Bill at his house. When we got there, I told Dad I had to poop. He says I'd have to ask Bill. 
Little background. Bill was an old-school Navy man and his house was immaculate. So when I used the bathroom and came right out and jumped onto Dad's lap in the car. Bill comes out with what was a concerned look on his face. I figured out what Bill was concerned about, and blurted out, ""I had beets for dinner."" Dad understood the situation immediately and ironed it out. I don't recall how but it makes me feel so warm and fuzzy thinking about it. It's such a wholesome memory. 😌",2023-10-11 01:56:55

dxtt76,"I try to use these interactions as a teaching moment to curious kids who seem to have well-meaning, but often ignorant and/or asshat parents.
They have to learn from somewhere, I might as well be an ambassador?!?

My 20# rescue that I’ve had for a few years now gets a little nervous when being approached by strangers, too, so at least in our situation, I find it also helps her remember that I’ve got her back and that I have no problem quickly standing between her and a triggering human/dog to “save” her.

So.

When we’re coming upon people (kids!) who clearly want to interact with my dog, I have her heel & sit.

.....aaaaand I know a lot of people here seem to dislike what I’m about to explain, but I’ve never been taught any differently, and it works for us. YMMV.

I’ll stoop down so I can grab the dog if needed, and nicely ask the kids to wait a second, then I show them how to tuck their thumb across their palm and make a loose, gentle fist, finger side facing down.
I then ask them to slowly put their fist at my dog’s nose level so she can sniff them out.
I can tell by how my girl reacts if she’s up for a petting or not.
I have no problem gently but firmly explaining to a family that my dog is a rescue so she can be kinda quirky sometimes and that it doesn’t mean they did anything wrong if she kind of looks away or doesn’t want to be touched.
If her body language signals a go for the pets, depending on the age of the child, I direct them to stroke her back and sides a few times while constantly checking in with my girl to see how she’s taking it. She honestly enjoys the hell out of the attention the majority of the time, but we all have our good and bad days~

She doesn’t bite, but she’ll face someone and growl/bark when she’s overwhelmed, though she rarely does that if above protocol is followed.

I just want to get it across to kids and parents that they have to ask the owner first, and if it’s ok, to either follow the owner’s directions or use the above loose fist at nose level greeting, and to always watch for signs that the doggie is having a bad day and to step back if they look grumpy, even if the owner isn’t saying anything or trying to control their damn dog. Some owners are quite honestly too ignorant to even have their dog in the first place if they haven’t bothered to read up on basic pet training & etiquette. Gahhh, I hate those people, but can’t blame the dog. Sigh.

The last thing I want to happen is a kid growing up in fear of dogs, but they also have to know to listen to the owner whether the doggie is ok to play with or not.

When the younger sibling/obnoxious kid invariably comes up to join original kid to pet my dog, I repeat above protocol if the child is old enough to understand.
Otherwise, I’ll sometimes gently wrap my hand around my girl’s snout to keep her from freaking out a tiny kid, maybe let the little one clumsily pat the dog on the back a few times, and then put myself between the visitors and my girl, because she knows by now that I have her back, and I don’t want to start eroding that trust.
I think she kinda gets it that suuuuuper-tiny people lack the tact she often finds in the bigger people, although we all know adults can be as bad as kids when approaching dogs.

When the quick visit is finished, ample praise to my baby as well as the kids who actually followed my directions.

But total props to everyone here that does what works best for their pets and for them.

My personal focus is on education and giving my dog structured practice working with strangers, as I’d like to train her as a therapy dog someday if she can handle strangers a little better. She’s improving, and I honestly think it’s because she trusts me more and more.
I just need to make sure she feels protected during these interactions.

Again, this is just what I do.

Y’all are welcome to RESPECTFULLY respond to this comment, and I’m happy to answer any questions I am qualified to answer.
Would also love for anyone who disagrees with my approach to let me know if there’s a better way of doing things....always room to learn~

Thanks for reading this far down ⭐️",2019-11-18 05:08:25

But in CDMA, this cannot be implemented because of its technological limitations. This is a huge plus as far as GSM devices are concerned."" Do you guys not have Google?

Edit 3: ""If someone in the U.S. does dial 112, some carriers treat it as an emergency call and reroute it to the 911 system.

j70c3n,"Right. I'm a quite decent home cook, and I rarely screw anything up...except things like steak. Because I cook it infrequently, with  technique I don't practice much. It's not like I can cook chicken thighs the same way as practice (please don't be pedantic). Also, to be honest, the (apparent) margins on a dinner at an old school steak house are lower than a lot of restaurant food. I don't go out for beef stew or ravioli. But it doesn't seem to cost that much more to get a good steak or prime rib dinner as opposed to making it myself, and the quality of beef is better than I can get unless I order online or make a road trip.

And if it gets overdone? I'll either never know about it, or I can politely ask for a remake. Never had to do that though. At home, well, there's always A-1 sauce. 😪",2020-10-08 12:37:44

dqzdx8,"TL;DR, hosts on AirBnB being shady and deceptive (fake profiles and false/staged photos) and using Bait n Switch tactics with little or no support or concern from AirBnB.

It's definitely worth the read if you do or plan to use AirBnB.

I've never used it but I stayed at an AirBnB with friends that was twice the cost of a hotel and not as nice or comfortable. It wouldn't have been my choice, but lesson learned regarding the person who booked it 😒",2019-11-03 20:46:00
dqzdx8,"I work for a offsite property management company and our biggest platform is airbnb. We had some guest contact us saying, there was another family there. Even though it was advertised as private home. When our guest approached the family they named the host as 'cynthia'...cynthia was the name of the maid. Her and her husband (the handy man) had a key to the property. We had a last minute booking & cynthia was not prepared.  We have not been able to get in contact with her since 🤦‍♀️",2019-11-03 23:57:08

Workers should have better rights In the USA. 

Private prison system should be destroyed. 

People shouldn't  be in jail for drugs (unless you sold to someone who's underage)

Police should be watched by a third party. 

Mental health should be at the forefront. 

Third, fourth and fifth parties should be allowed to debate. The two party dictatorship is a joke.

Career politicians... we need to end that.

This went on for about 3 hrs before he asked me to stop calling. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!!! I explained "" fuck no goatfucker! This stops when I say it stops!

Once again, no one is purposely torturing animals here. Stop moving goalposts. I'm not going to sit and watch an animal die just because lol. Im just not going to feel any ways if the animal does die. Mice are unwanted pests, so yes it is much different than leaving an innocent fox locked in a cage.

You seem super fixated on something that has absolutely nothing to do with you. I believe in the right to exterminate any unwanted species in my home, and will feel no ways on how the animal dies/suffers to death. You are the only one being so dramatic and overreacting, as well as moving goalposts to suit a totally different objective (no one said anything about purposely torturing animals except you)🤡",2019-07-25 07:26:25

The only thing I find with those is that there’s waaaay too much soap in them! Like holy

xz57uz,"I agree, after the video i tried pods only, pod with powder in prewash, then powder only in both. The powder only does not clean certain things as well. I make hot tea in a larger container, and it sits half the day while i drink it cold. That glass container i use to make tea is many times cleaner on pods and powder than just on powder. There has to be a stronger cutting agent or more abrasive in the pod than powder alone. But for now i use pod in main and powder in prewash and everything is super sparkly clean. That tea container i use was a dead giveaway. It couldn't clean the glass container as well using only powder without the pod. Using oy the pod,sometimes chunks got stuck randomly as rinse had no soap in it. Now that i use both it's rare something does not come out clean. 

To each their own with this but for most uses, the powder only is great. That extra discoloration we get from certain foods does not come off unless we use the pods in our Miele dishwasher. But even then oy the cascade platinum pods get things that clean, the regar pods don't after trying both as well.

This was in Austin, TX in the summer time, the masks just got clogged and you couldn’t breathe after not that much time all from the moisture from sweat or breath. We’d end up changing them and going through so many that there were plenty of days where there were no more on site. Some guys just straight up never wore them I at least always tried to be conscious of the eventual death I was breathing and exposed to.  

This was all pre silicosis osha regulations so no one had personal respirators and there was less strict rules and enforcement etc.

I have played with the idea of writing books, either on philosophy or hard military science fiction which are my favorite genres.

Would be cool to see if I have potential to grow in that direction as a hobby. I remember having fun when I could write something clever. Don't need the extra money, it would just be a fun thing do different creative work that may entertain others. My Achilles heel has always been motivation so I am much more likely to loose interest mid way and end up abandoning it when there is actual tedious work to finish it.
Probably better off just playing with the idea, take some notes and wait and see if the interest is more than a temporary impulse.

For me, I tried to avoid bringing him in for two months, I have a relatively minor issue. Insurance companies are so shady and will do anything they can to sweat you out without getting you treatment or paid (if you’re entitled). I mean I legitimately had this company try to starve me out by denying benefits to force me back to work, so they could close my case without paying for my treatment. I couldn’t feed myself for nearly two months aside from literal charity from a church. If I hadn’t had a lawyer, I’d have caved and taken some minimum wage job and absolutely injured myself much, much worse. Just to eat, not even covering house payments, etc. 

Of course lawyers are after money. You want the lawyer that’s after someone else’s money lol. I saw a decent settlement and the percentage I paid (mind you, they didn’t take a penny from me until the backend, after I was paid, and even covered some of my expenses over several years) was worth EVERY penny. I don’t lawyer up to try and “get over” on someone or get out of trouble or get away with something - it’s because I’m not an idiot and can openly admit I am ignorant to ALL of my rights. I paid this company to handle ALL of the administration related work down to getting me appointments and scripts on time, even scheduling shit. My lawyer had his days in court filing injunctions and the like for me to bully the insurance company, but I really didn’t have to do much but focus on surviving and healing during one of the worst times of my life. All because I lawyered up even though I felt like an idiot, or some sort of criminal for doing it early, before I’d had issues. 


Yeah, lawyers can be assholes. Everyone can be. Mine has never been to me, and I know I sure as hell don’t want a pushover fighting for my literal rights. 


NOTE: ALL of my experience has been related to injury and workers compensation cases, so I fully understand it’s much different with criminal and typical civil cases.

iq2vwx,"Okay so an EpiPen or in the case of a small child an EpiPen Jr. Is an adrenaline shot I think it has about 15 minutes worth as it's supposed to give time for an ambulance to arrive but of if it is not helping then you can administrator it 5 minutes after the first. I would like to add here that an Epipen alone will not fully stop a reaction you have to get them to the hospital. So if you administrator it wrong the first thing is that these things have long ass needles so it will hurt like hell. Both needles are 22 gauges and the EpiPen needle is 16 mm and the EpiPen Jr is 13mm. You do not want to fuck up using these. It can cause heart palpitations and loss of blood flow to hands and feet if you accidentally inject yourself. What the image got wrong is that you administrator it to the outside of the thigh. Don't worry about clothing these are built to get through it. Basically pull the safety pin from the top and quick swift motion into the the outside of the thigh. Here is the quote from the EpiPen UK website because it's what came up.

>The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of ""...""AP39""...."", on bioenergetics, viability, and mitochondrial DNA integrity in bEnd.3 murine microvascular endothelial cells in vitro, under normal conditions, and during oxidative stress.

I don't know what bioenergetics or mitochondrial DNA integrity is, but it sounds like ""oxidative stress"" is the undesired thing that happens when a cell is diseased. Googling ""oxidative stress"" yields a bunch of results about diabetes, parkinsons, Alzheimer's and cancer.

A few lines down from that:

>Oxidative stress was induced by addition of glucose oxidase.

So oxidative stress will fuck a cells shit up, and ""glucose oxidase"" is an enzyme that the researchers could introduce to cells to cause oxidative stress.

Just a disclaimer im not a doctor or a scientist so 🤷‍♂️

**edit**: heres the orig paper if anyone wants to look at it. another interesting thing that i think is probably a separate lesson is the ""conflict of interest"" section where the authors note the hold a patent on AP39

10vd22z,"Not a douche at all! In my case, since it was a public site I had, a VPN wasn't going to work exactly? As far as I know? I'm all ears if there is actually a creative way to use one for this 👀 as I don't necessarily do networking specifically for a living, and am still very early into my career all things considered 

As for port forwards, I do this now with a Nextcloud NAS, and DynDNS via Cloudflare, beforehand when I requested a static IP, to then port forward, that was... not an option given to me. I genuinely thought it was weird, but I got sent to a few different people on their chat support, and the best thing they offered me was the Static/Public IP 8 - plan add on. I did use the other IPs, but as I mentioned in another comment (I'm on mobile right now trying to keep up lol) I really could have gotten away with not doing that.",2023-02-07 01:42:32
10vd22z,"Ah right, gotcha! 

Without going into a crazy amount of detail, a VPN can authenticate you and (essentially) put you on the same LAN regardless of your geographical location, so that you can access local network resources without needing things like external IPs or port forwards / network address translation (NAT) setup. 

It’s a convenient way for you to access the things you might need to from outside - but you do need something to run the VPN service itself. If it was a home network you can run something like OpenVPN, which is open source. 

If it was a corporate / commercial network you’d probably terminate the VPN either on your edge device (I.e. firewall) or on a server or similar. 

It doesn’t solve all problems, but it does save you the hassle of setting up 5 or 6 different entry points for your individual systems - instead you just have one entry point (the VPN) and then once connected, you have access from there as if you were sitting at home 😊

Sounds like you got what you needed from your ISP though they’ve probably up sold you a little - you’d probably do fine with 1 IP (which is when you’d use port forwards to route to different services internally), but having multiple IPs is not exactly a bad thing - probably just overkill 😁

Yep. Those are actors who are alive 

There are reasons your hospice workers ask you to leave the room when they’re helping the funeral home people to lift and move your loved one into a body bag and then zip up the bag: 

Dead bodies make noises when moved and air is released. 

People are usually incontinent when they die. 

Fluid may come out of all holes- including their mouths, especially when you have to put the bed flat and lower their head. 

Nobody needs to see this or have this memory in their minds of the last time they saw their loved one

We’re doing you a favor. Please leave. We are trying to protect you. 

On a different note- not hospice related-
If the funeral home insists on you looking to identify a person, see if someone who can handle this can go. I could handle it. Many could not. It would be very tough for a lot of people. You never know what’ll bother you.  I saw all kinds of stuff in hospice. What can’t I handle? Car accidents and being the first person there.  I could never be a cop or a paramedic. At least with hospice it’s at work and I’m mentally prepared. Coming across an accident scares the crap out of me. Will I respond if I have to?? Yes, of course. But I’d rather not have to. A cop friend said she could handle seeing anything as long as it was outside. She hated hospitals.  I’m the opposite. 🤷‍♀️",2022-11-14 16:43:28

yv0nb2,"I was so horrified when the funeral home said I *had* to look at my mother in the coffin (even tho it was.a closed casket funeral) to ensure the *right* person was in there. The funeral director said to me that since I didn't send a photograph, he just did her hair like mine (which was just a shortish/normal cut). He opened her coffin and all I could see was this large beehive hairdo like she was one of the Supremes. All I could say was ""You think MY hair looks like that??""  I was kind of embarrassed 😳 by my response but, funnily enough, hair style was probably mom's and mine biggest issue. Maybe her last joke?",2022-11-14 15:15:12

ql5kv5,"Used to drink around a cup every day or two, until the pandemic happened and I got to taper down. Then I realized that when I do drink it, drinking coffee made my energy feel ""dirty"" (hard to explain, but I imagine it's a bit like what mania is like) and sometimes I even got panic attacks. One time I went to the emergency room thinking I was dying, and after tests came out mostly normal, the doctor told me to lay off the coffee in addition to giving me meds and requesting tests. 😅 

Brought it up with a psychiatrist, and they told me that does happen to some people, but it's not too common. If you experience something similiar, at least for me, they recommended cutting it out. If really needed, have half (I know it sounds ridiculous but it helps haha) and stay away from the strong stuff.

Personally I’m not on a keto diet but have found this incredibly helpful. https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/what-bulletproof-coffee I recommend doing a good amount of research to understand how it’s works. My layman’s explanation is that the oils encapsulate the caffeine allowing it to be slowly released throughout the day. I find if I drink more than one cup of normal coffee per day I become extremely anxious and irritable to the point of anger at those around me.

xk8gtn,"Some people have reach-in deep freezers/chest freezers that could accommodate a cooler of most sizes. Almost anyone that hunts assuredly owns one, and coolers also come in various sizes. 

This also applies to pretty much anything insulated that’s meant to keep things cold, like water bottles.

If you don’t have a fridge or freezer large enough to accommodate it, you can “pre chill” the cooler by filling it to the top with ice or ice packs, let it sit overnight, empty out whatever has melted, and then refill with food/drinks more ice. 

You can also pop a cup or two of dry ice nuggets into a dry cooler, shake it around really good, and let it sit until the dry ice evaporates (5-10lbs per 24 hours, so pretty quickly.) then refill with ice. Dry ice is typically surprisingly easy to get your hands on. Most companies that sell ice also sell dry ice and they don’t check if you’re a business or not most of the time. 😊🫠

This happened a lot at a park we used to frequent. An area of the park is designated off leash while the walking trail surrounding this area is on leash. Sometimes we'd venture to the off leash area but I mostly enjoyed keeping my pup on leash and walking the trail. We would run into SO many off leash dogs with zero recall while walking the trail.

And yup sometimes that veryyyy brief pause is there, and then the heavy stuff starts again. Aw no, that sounds terrible. And absolutely agreed with crying through vomiting, I did too. It just feels so bad. 
I’m glad they finally got you through and into some treatment! 

That sounds terrible. It is so painful! The weakness that it causes is unmatched. It feels like your body is failing. Not even being able to stand on your own. Or walk on your own. It feels so weird. 
I work in elderly care so I’m used to assisting people in and out of wheelchairs, in and out of bed etc…but being in that position myself felt absolutely surreal.
Yes, the hospital floor isn’t the worry at that time. And I hope you never have to feel that way again. 

RIGHT?! I fucking love IV anti-nausea. It’s like heaven in liquid form. Just the relief for the muscles of the abdomen to stop for a while, gosh. Oh yea, the saline too. Truly beautiful. It perks you up so quickly! 
My nurse was an absolute angel, so got me a heat pack to go on my IV site because she didn’t want me to be cold when the saline went in. She took me seriously the whole time and was so so lovely. It made such a difference. I even got to have 4 warm blankets because I was so cold. I struck luck with the staff that were on that night. 

Oh god, you had 4 salines?! Jesus, you were in extreme dehydration. I’m so glad it made you feel better. I love your description of the hydration and the cells. 
I’m glad they recognised you were in pain. This sounds so horrific, I hope the pain relief helped.

Because when I see posts of people panicking and nitpicking absolutely every intercation that could make them sick, it reminds me how I was the *exact same* and how miserable I was then. I turned to online communities to reassure me when I thought I was gonna be sick, but ended up scrolling through hundreds of similar posts and became comfortable being in a bubble of fear and anxiety.

Some build for dealerships. Some only build when customers order. 

Ford, Chevy, Kia, etc build what’s called dealer inventory. You CAN order custom vehicles with usually a small deposit down. 

Higher end companies like Mercedes, Jaguar and BMW only build cars that are already backed by approved financing and customer ordered. Meaning they have names attached. Rarely do dealers order; but there are cases when they do; because some people do not know that these types of cars aren’t just sitting on a lot new. They are often more “base model” since the full car payment is being made by the dealer until they are sold.

There were several passengers standing around, none seriously injured. I instructed everyone to move ahead of the vehicles and up onto an elevated barrier. I kid you not, less than one minute after I had them move, another car slid and hit the wall right where they were standing.

I’m prescribed Zenzedi generic, I love caffeine and I’m quite tolerant to stimulants but if I take a break they work just the same. I’ve been ADD a along as I can remember, your singular anecdotal experience doesn’t actually mean anything other than your subjective experience.

Agree to disagree, it could have to do with uptake of cAMP causing TAAR1 agonism which has been shown in studies to be relevant to ADD, so sure it *could* help a bit when you’re non tolerant but it’s no way a medication for ADD. This also wouldn’t explain why it makes someone tired unless the cAMP levels are increased to the point of completely inhibiting the uptake of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin which if this happened would probably no longer be functional for ADD. But yes your single example unsupported by real research is 100% correct how Redditor of you. 💀 Not to mention if you’re hyperactive a highly peripheral stimulant would make this worse, not better.

1ctkj7h,"I need to do this. I literally just got off a call with an insurance company asking me about things I had no idea about. My dad had discussed changing my car insurance but never told me he was changing it at a specific time when I was working from home. The insurance company was asking me questions which were obviously based on answers that my dad provided online. Answers which I had no idea about. This was fucking pissing me off that dad had done all this behind my back and I went into a call with 0 context, information and no time to mentally prepare. My parents must think I’m joking or exaggerating when I say that I hate phone calls but this actually gave me anxiety. When I had a go at my dad he said “it’s just confirming your information” which isn’t true. They were asking me to make a decision on if I would accept the quote and all the other extras chucked in there. All I was doing was relaying information from my dad who was mouthing answers and writing some down on paper. Surely there’s a fucking option for him to talk on my behalf because I felt so useless. I wasn’t in the right head space for this call and now I’m expected to answer questions that my dad had already answered online (supposedly). My undiagnosed ADHD was going mental as I can only focus on one thing at a time. I was finding it so hard to focus on my dad’s mouthing, writing and on the phone call all at once. My parents hate it when I self-diagnose things and try to laugh it all off “oh you don’t have that”. They are supportive of mental health since I do some community work with it but when it actually comes right down to it, they don’t fully understand it and my triggers. It just made me feel really uncomfortable but of course they don’t understand that because they went through so much worse and turned out totally fine 🙄 I just hate phone calls and being put on the spot like that. I know that the person on the phone would’ve been a bit confused with some of my answers and there was some times where it was just silence. If I could I’d apologise to that person because of what my dad was doing. But of course we had to pretend that I was the one who filled in the online application even though my dad did it on my behalf (which I didn’t agree to)

Just to clarify - I love my parents. Some days they just really piss me off and it feels like they don’t understand my undiagnosed anxiety/adhd.

1ctkj7h,"Your parents too, huh? I thought it was just mine. (Regarding the mental health stuff) I'm 39 and finally got diagnosed a couple years ago. Finally taking medication for my adhd (started taking it regularly two-three weeks ago) and man, it's changed my life for the better. Phone calls dont give me the anxiety they used to. My job requires me to call and take calls from customers (insurance, ironically lol) and it used to be I'd pick up the phone, dial the number and hold the phone in my hand for 20-30 minutes amping myself up, preparing what I was going to say before finally pressing the call button. 

Now, I'm picking up the phone, dialing and pressing send within seconds. Making phone calls has become relatively easy, and I absolutely have my adhd meds to thank for that. 

I hate when people say ""trust me bro,"" but.. trust me bro, get on some meds and improve your life. All it takes is an online Dr visit with one of those companies advertised on Facebook or Reddit.. I use ""Done"" and they prescribed me my meds after the first phone call. The dr may barely speak English, but that guy probably got his visa to become and American dr 😂 hey. I'll take it.

It's crucial for viewers to exercise caution and skepticism when engaging with content on platforms like YouTube or TikTok, especially when it involves the well-being of animals.

By being discerning consumers of online content, individuals can play a role in discouraging the creation and promotion of misleading or exploitative videos.

First for the lost/found pet posts; check the original post to see if the comments have been disabled. Huge 🚩! If so, you can assume it’s fake because the “owner” would have no way of contacting the “finder” or vice versa.
