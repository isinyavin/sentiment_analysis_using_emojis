Because even though the conventional wisdom is that HEPA filters have gaps wider than .3 microns, and so they can't do anything about viruses, that's not true.

We are STEM folk so can afford daycare, work healthcare. What about everyone else? You are lying to yourselves that things are great when the wealth divide is so great and society doesn't provide for those less fortunate.


I'm starting to see why so many people see Trump as the best choice. He despises due process, the office, the presidency(completely disrespects it), progressives, people who have the time and resources to think how to fix the country properly, people who propose giving handouts to the less fortunate, just like many others who don't have it as good as us and are struggling. He is the perfect analogy of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Sure over the past couple of years his made it much worse for his base with coporate tax cuts, cuts to services, massive debt and tariffs but apart from some farmers I can still see a lot of people voting for him again. Not sure if a recession is coming, even if it does, the people most affected by it will most certainly vote against Universal basic income and Universal healthcare because they have it so tough and will be told it will go to immigrants and the less fortunate. Being told the lie you are the best and pride will make them vote against their own self interests. Eliminating the electoral college, fixing the supreme Court, ACA, addressing climate head on, increasing taxes on personal earnings over $10m, taking corporate money out of elections will all help but aren't great platforms to get elected on for a lot of people.

My parents both gave me the guilt trip but once I moved out and lived on my own,  the relationship evolved (got worse at first) into something I love and respect. Now that I’m married and have kids (with a white devil 😂) my parents could not be happier. I still ask them for advice and they’re close enough to visit their grandkids as often as they want.... but it gives them the freedom to travel and be together as a couple that they lacked when they were raising us.

mwtdiq,"Interesting, thanks for sharing. Pulled out the conclusion for lazy people like me below. Seems like a pretty exhaustive analysis and you’re right. Likely something to it other than placebo.

>In conclusion, the oral administration of lavender essential oil, standardized and titrated to linalool and linalyl acetate concentrations (like Silexan®), seems to have a promising efficacy in the treatment of anxiety, although further high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm these findings, possibly investigating lavender essential oil in the form of a medicinal product. The administration of lavender essential oil through inhalation seems effective in the reduction of anxiety levels, and, in particular, its simplicity, safety, and low cost make it a therapeutic option which may be considered in certain clinical contexts. However, even in this case, it would be recommended to confirm these findings with further high-quality RCTs, considering the heterogeneity of available data and high prevalence of high risk-of-bias trials, although the efficacy of lavender seems to be confirmed even when low-quality studies are excluded from the analysis, and additional analyses seem to confirm the reliability of this finding. Lavender essential oil administered through massage appears effective, but available studies are not sufficient to determine with certainty whether the benefit is due to a specific effect of lavender, thus impeding from clearly differentiating it from the beneficial effect of massage. Other ways of administration do not have enough data (or no data at all, like the sublingual route of administration) in their support to draw any conclusion. Proportionally, only a limited percentage of studies report data about safety of lavender-based interventions, but available information essentially outlines a safe profile without severe adverse effects. It is advisable that further high-quality trials are conducted trying to make study designs more homogeneous, and that more attention should be paid to safety data collecting and reporting.",2021-04-23 16:31:43

Perhaps I’m misunderstanding either your point or the article itself, but aren’t you referring to the appeal to nature fallacy? Meaning, drawing the conclusion that children chose dogs over humans prior to learned behavior (socializing + experience) that means that decision is natural and therefore it’s moral. 

As opposed to the naturalistic fallacy, which seems to be an argument against defining words like “good” or “natural” (ethically speaking) with other terms like “pleasure” or “positive” because the “base words”, like good, are functionally immune to precise definition; they exist as the reference point by which to define other terms, such as “pleasure”.

It *could* be in the form of HOH, i.e. plain old water, or it could be in the form of hydroxide contained within minerals, or even stuff like methanol (CH3OH) or drain cleaner (NaOH) could show the same spectral signature for OH. 

These new measurements show unequivocally that there is *some*--although I will emphasize a very small amount, only a few hundred parts per million--molecular water on the Moon. It could be trapped within glass (which does not have mineral crystal structure so the water stays in molecular form) or it could be adsorbed onto the surface of regolith particles. Either way, it's not like there are lakes, ponds, or aquifers on the Moon. But very cool nonetheless 😊",2020-10-26 20:28:27

k92522,"Access to those items was never for crime reduction--it was to outfit local law enforcement in the event of a large scale terrorist attack, where in the local LE would need to perform roles in both civil LE as well as local protection from foreign/domestic armed groups as widespread mobilization of the military within an AOR the size of the United States, while maintaining tactical and strategic advantage, is not feasible until allied air/ground support is provided.

These items were also in surplus, so they were sold at very low cost, or given to LE.

There are more facets to this, but that is the strategic reason for what appears to be rapid militarization... although it is NOT rapid. Police had been slowly militarized for decades because of a little thing called the Cold War, where a ground invasion and nuclear strike was likely for many years--peaking in 1983 when we were quite literally almost wiped off the face of the planet.

gotf27,"Like I said, I'm an outsider briefly looking in, I think I was bound to make some mistakes 😁 

I have heard some worrying things about kindergarten in the US though (and a lot of other places too), that kinder children have higher academic expectations than they used to. It worries me because there is a lot of research out there that says this is bad practice, it doesn't benefit children in the long term, and in some cases actively harms a child's education. I often find myself wondering about the kids in my class, who are learning to read and write at 5, when they aren't developmentally ready until they are 7. By the time they are ready to learn, they've got two years of feeling like a failure under their belt.

Kids learn through play, we need to give them the opportunity to play, to develop and test their own theories about the world - but you can't test for that! You can test if they can write cvc words with correctly formed letters, but just because we can test it, does that mean it's important?

I would love for my kids to get more sleep, but between my work schedule and my wife's the current start of day for their school (7:45) is already pushing it for (one of) us to get to work on time. 

The reason I bring that up is: Are school times not based around typical M-F work schedules? I was always under the assumption that school started so early so parents had enough time to get to work after dropping off their kids.

7mpvn7,Can't tell if ironic or not...🤔,2017-12-29 02:20:24
7mpvn7,I can strongly relate to that. I grew up in India where premarital sex is considered a taboo that can result in being disowned by family (if they find out...) and is seen at the same level of murdering some one. But times are changing and the idea of premarital sex is accepted by millennials and is slowly growing on them though their older peers (mostly family) still condemn it. I think that might happen with religious beliefs too as the younger generations are distancing themselves from it. Interestingly most teenagers who took a pledge to stay virgin (Silver Ring Thing) till marriage didn't keep up with their words 🙈 so that should tell those people that these are not that effective anymore.,2017-12-29 04:22:32
7mpvn7,"> So why not use the best methods available? 

Because they’re afraid that if they teach proper sex ed, some teens are gonna be like “YEEHAW TIME TO GO BUY CONDOMS AND HAVE LOTS OF SEX! THAT’S WHAT THEY TAUGHT ME!” And sure, a few kids *would* be like that—but not at all. But they’re just not willing to “risk a few to save the many” basically. They essentially risk none but lose most—but as long as their consciences feel clean, they feel okay losing most. “I personally did not teach a child about sex, so none of these teen pregnancies are on ME. They’re on Satan 😌,” is the attitude. ",2017-12-29 01:37:05

Cartridges, disposable(like JUuL) or reusable(like JUUL if you’re poor like me or can afford reusable carts), are filled with a distillate concentrate, more like oil really...similar to nicotine Vape juice but sometimes thicker. These are HIGHly(pun intended) concentrated, like I’ve seen up to 93% THC whereas flower is on avg 17-19% THC, personally 23.7 % is the highest amount I’ve come across in the flower category and it looked almost alien purple/red and I’ll be lucky to see that around again. You can also get Vape Pens that instead of screwing on the previously mentioned carts, there are little metal chambers that have quartz coils on the bottom that will atomize whatever, like drop a piece of wax in, screw a lid on, and boom DIY waxing vape you can take on the go... [Looks like this(I have this one and it’s great because I can use either the chamber or carts)](https://kingpenvapes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/yocan-evolve-plus-apart.jpg) 

Hash seems to be a thing of the past. Today there are tons of different types of concentrates and even more methods to obtain them. Wax, shatter, rosin, butter, nectar , crumble etc are all under this umbrella...I call it the post hash blast:) because of all the new and inventive ways people are developing its interesting to see how now people seem to prefer the mixed blends, like 3:1 (thc:CBD).

Why not use the plants then? Because you *can't patent a plant* and if you can't patent it, you can't make much money from it.

I used to work in a testing lab and it's unreal. Safety and accessibility have very little to do with it, merely whether or not you can ensure your corner the market with the new(!!!) and/or improved(😱) *patented* formula. 

Now, as a person with a bio and chem background, I'm not irrationally afraid of synthetics, but nor do I trust them to be made for the right reasons. The universities doing research are doing incredible work, but that often gets hijacked by pharma companies. 

I'd bet a burger that if there is a public and political shift admitting psilocybin as a useful theraputic drug, it will absolutely be a synthesized version made available by a major drug company. Likely with more side effects than it's natural counterpart.",2020-11-04 17:18:16

*Images created by u/k1next credit should Deffo go to him for this interesting graph 🙂*

Kinda mad to think that nearly 50% of america is classed as obease, nearly 80% being classed as overweight

For a better idea of individual health, obviously see a health professional but Body Fat Percentage is a good metric apparently 🙂

Food companies want you to think that, so you’ll think it’s ok to have two slices of pizza and consume 700 calories, in addition to that 70 grams of sugar and 200 plus calories in your soda...just as long as you take the dog for a walk. Such BS and why most people struggle with weight loss.

We sometimes face the unfortunate reality of being brushed off by (all gendered/agendered) doctors when we try to get help for pain, especially pain related to our genitals. I've never really understood it, as all abnormal pain deserves investigation. It's not nothing to say ""my body is doing me a favour, alerting me that something is wrong, now I'm alerting you, please help me find out where the pain is coming from"". 

If your pain is ultimately deemed to be normal in the sense that it's menstrual pain and not endo or PCOS, it's still intense pain and there is treatment as far as I know. When my cramps were intense growing up I was given extra strength naproxen and some other medication, but my coworker told me that she was taking a medication specifically for menstrual cramps that I have never heard of, so there must be options.

What is interesting, though, is that this survey seems to be more balanced in terms of race and gender: 

> The 2017 Stress in America™ survey was conducted online within the United States by Harris Poll on behalf of the American Psychological Association between Aug. 2 and 31, 2017, among 3,440 adults age 18+ who reside in the U.S., including 1,376 men, 2047 women, 1,088 white, 810 Hispanic, 808 black, 506 Asian, and 206 Native American adults. Interviews were conducted in English (n=3,187) and Spanish (n=253). **Data were weighted to reflect their proportions in the population. Weighting variables included age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income.** Propensity score weighting was also used to adjust for respondents’ propensity to be online. Hispanic respondents were weighted for acculturation, taking into account respondents’ household language as well as ability to read and speak in English and Spanish. Because the sample is based on those who were invited and agreed to participate in the Harris Poll online research panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. A full methodology is available upon request. (emphasis mine)

According to Pew Research's recent [typology survey](http://www.people-press.org/2017/10/24/1-partisanship-and-political-engagement/), *roughly* equal numbers of Americans lean Republican and Democratic, but in the methodology that u/IDe- cited, Democrats seem to be overrepresented.

yes, you shouldn't let an iPad parent your kid, but with reasonably attentive guardians, recognizing screens and potential learning tools, and reasonable limits, screentime is not that big of a deal, imo. the research is also all over the board, so i don't give total credence to any one piece of published research. seems kind of sensationalized to me 🤷‍♀️",2019-01-11 22:04:27

Between me and my gal we have 10 kids 4 in the house rest old and out of the house. We are certainly not terrified of our special little guys.

They were very nice people in a rough situation. I remember the exact moment we all bonded: my wife and I were making a garden in our backyard and felt like we were being watched. I looked up and there stood their son, naked, holding his junk in his hand and twirling it like a helicopter. I'm not saying that to be funny, either. That's what he was doing. I ran around front to find his mom to let her know he'd left the house, and she darted off to take care of him. She came up to me afterward and was very timid, like ""uh, you know he, uh, didn't mean anything by that, uh, right?"" ""Of course not! These things happen, and no harm done. I just thought you'd want to know."" She gave my wife and me a giant bear hug, and we were happy neighbors for the rest of our time there.",2019-12-20 17:31:00

However we have to keep in mind the true dimension of getting rid of Covid. 
The road to a vaccine is much harder than people think. we have to complete 3 enormous tasks that never have been done in history in the time and scope needed now. 
1- Discover a vaccine
2- Manufacture 4 or 5 billion dosis
3- Distribute and apply the vaccine to 4 or 5 billion people in 190 countries.

I think it might be that viruses and bacterium have greater self preservation techniques or attributes that allows them to live on a host despite immune reactions.

I had a young guy come out on site at a client’s rehab hospital and he could not wake up to be on time and functional before 9am. It reflected very bad on our company. On top of that, he approached it as if the workplace needed to adjust to what he was use to. Idk, it just appears to set false expectations for them. I think yanking these youngsters out of a 9am start time in school and wanting them to now hit the world full speed by 7am is setting them up for failure.

It's a very weird thing to happen, and scientists are able to learn lots and lots of science stuff from seeing it happen.

Here's lots more saying the same thing.

Adolescent Premature Ovarian Insufficiency Following Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: A Case Series Seen in General Practice.

Three young women developed premature ovarian insufficiency following quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The unrelated girls were aged 16, 16, and 18 years at diagnosis. Each had received HPV vaccinations prior to the onset of ovarian decline. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26425627

Human papilloma virus vaccine and primary ovarian failure: another facet of the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants.

Evidence of the potential of the HPV vaccine to trigger a life-disabling autoimmune condition. The increasing number of similar reports of post HPV vaccine-linked autoimmunity and the uncertainty of long-term clinical benefits of HPV vaccination are a matter of public health that warrants further rigorous inquiry. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23902317/

A link between human papilloma virus vaccination and primary ovarian insufficiency: current analysis.

An increasing number of cases of POI post-HPV4 are being reported. Possible mechanisms for the suspected effect of HPV on female reproductive function are a toxic effect or an autoimmune response. The trigger could be the vaccine immunogen contents or the adjuvants, the latter are used to increase the immune reaction. The adjuvant in HPV4 contains aluminum. Animal models have shown aluminum exposure to inhibit expression of female reproductive hormones and to induce histologic changes in the ovaries. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26125978

Mumps and ovarian cancer: modern interpretation of an historic association

Mumps parotitis may lead to expression and immune recognition of a tumor-associated form of MUC1 and create effective immune surveillance of ovarian cancer cells that express this form of MUC1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951028/

Premature ovarian failure 3 years after menarche in a 16-year-old girl following human papillomavirus vaccination.

This patient presented with amenorrhoea after identifying a change from her regular cycle to irregular and scant periods following vaccinations against human papillomavirus. Premature ovarian failure was then notified as a possible adverse event following this vaccination. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23035167",2020-01-28 19:56:28

v0n9bl,"GUN RESPONSIBILITY LEADS TO GUN SAFETY
A Common-Sense Approach to Second Amendment Issues.  ©
     With the increasing massacres, gun-related deaths, and heartbreaking reports of children with guns, (up to 8 child incidents per day in the US), almost everyone can agree there are too many guns in our society. The death toll is rising along with the number of guns. Mindful of the Las Vegas Massacre in which almost 1,200 rounds were fired, mostly into the crowd, by a single shooter in a very few minutes, it’s time to fully grasp that guns are primarily designed to kill or maim people and animals. Since their basic nature is lethal, society is fully justified in requiring firearm protections to ensure public safety. 
     There is no need or justification to repeal the 2nd Amendment enshrined in our Constitution, it was put there to safeguard freedoms… and freedom’s obligations. The way to address 2nd Amendment issues is to legislate responsible, well-regulated gun ownership as the 2nd Amendment clearly states. 
1.	  Responsibility of Gun Ownership
     As a deadly weapon, every gun must have an owner who is legally responsible for it.
An unregistered gun is a threat to civilized society because no one is legally responsible. Guns are dangerous. If no one is willing to accept the responsibility for a gun, it should be destroyed. 

2.	 Licensing, Registration, and Background Checks
    Every gun and its owner must be Licensed and Registered and all gun owners must pass a Background Check.
This is how society can identify and regulate who is responsible for a gun. Society mandates the same three basic requirements for motor vehicles, despite their primary purpose being simply transportation. 

3.	Insure All Firearms
    If you drive a car, you are expected to have liability insurance. It is your responsibility.
Like driving, gun responsibility requires gun owners’ insurance so that victims or anyone else involved can be suitably compensated. Society must not bear the predictable costs when individuals claim gun ownership rights without accepting gun ownership responsibilities. 
    Who currently pays to clean up a murder, suicide, or mass shooting? Incredibly, these costs are paid by taxpayers and victims.

4.	The gun owner is liable for their gun 
     No matter what happens with a gun, if the registered owner fails to secure it, the owner is both responsible and liable.
Guns don’t kill people, they are just efficient tools. People kill people. Guns cannot be held liable, therefore ‘accidents’ cannot be blamed on guns as they often are now. Gun responsibility requires guns to be kept securely, so they can’t fall into the wrong hands.  
     As a deadly weapon, guns cannot be ‘accidentally’ pointed at anyone. If anyone is wounded or killed by a gun being cleaned, handled, or dropped, the gun owner is responsible and liable.   
    Killing unnecessarily is horrible. The shooting of a child, or by a child, is the worst crime imaginable and must be treated as such. If a child has access to a gun, the gun owner is liable for what happens next. If a child or anyone else is ‘accidentally’ killed or wounded, the gun owner must, at a minimum, be charged with some degree of Murder. If a child has access to a gun, the crime is recognized by law as depraved indifference to the consequences of not securing the gun, and the gun owner is charged accordingly. Any of the above crimes cannot legally be the fault of a child or a gun. Accidental discharge cannot be considered a defense.



5.	Do Not Threaten Your Neighbor With a Firearm    
     Civilian concealed carry is sometimes necessary for self-defense, but a concealed gun does not imply a threat to anyone unless openly displayed. 
Public, civilian open-carry (in a non-hunting or target practice setting) is an implicit threat to your neighbor, a bully’s intimidation tactic. Open-carry put in basic terms demands (from another point of view); ‘Do not mess with me, I have granted myself Police powers. I am fully prepared to shoot you at any time, and for any reason, I think applies.’ Proponents may call it self-defense, or exercising their rights, but from another point of view, it is an assumed claim to possibly be your Judge, Jury, and Executioner.
Openly carried firearms have no place at Government Offices, public establishments, or at protests on our streets where they increase tensions, constitute an extra-judicial mob, invite law-enforcement reprisals, and intensify police militarization. 

6.	  Live by the Gun, Possibly Die by the Gun
     Stand your ground laws are a legal path to anarchy, because, from either end of the gun, you can legally be the next victim. 
‘Stand Your Ground’ laws say you only have to feel threatened to defend yourself, anywhere, at any time. Since it is often problematic to tell a good guy with a gun from a bad guy with a gun, anyone has the right under these laws, to feel threatened by civilian, open-carry. As a result, the threatened have the legal right to defend themselves. Like the Wild West, the problem turns into who shot first and why? The logic of these laws is indefensible.

7.	Rapid-Firing, Multi-cartridge Weapons Are Weapons of Mass Destruction  
     As a practical definition, any weapon that can kill many people quickly and easily (or silently) is a Weapon of Mass Destruction. 
Do the dead know any difference between a Bomb, a Chemical Weapon, or a Rapid-Fire, Multi-Cartridge Firearm? There is no responsible justification for civilians to own these weapons unless killing all your neighbors is considered self-defense. These are Weapons of War and Terrorism and otherwise have no practical use to society. We spend huge sums worldwide on our military to protect us from these weapons… just not on our streets. 
     Our Police, First Responders, and the Military are skilled public servants and deserve our support. Their lives are on the front line in the course of their duties. We should not ask them to face weapons of mass destruction, on duty or off. If you think clearly about it, no one on the streets of America, should. Own them legally or not, keep them responsibly, don’t parade them in the streets, unless you are prepared to surrender them.

8.	Militias Are Only Legal When Called Forth
     Although militias are mentioned in the Second Amendment, It is settled law that they can legally exist only if, and when, called forth by a Governor or President. Militias are private armies and require responsible control. Unlike an Army with transparent command and control structures with civilian oversight, a militia is an armed mob, a form of terrorist cell, responsible only to themselves, and potentially hazardous to everyone else. A peaceful society cannot tolerate guerilla forces in their midst, and certainly not armed, private militaries parading in our streets or practicing for the overthrow of our government.    

Finally, let’s take a moment to send our thoughts and prayers for our brave American children who give up their lives to protect our current, almost entirely unregulated, 2nd Amendment right to bear arms.",2022-05-30 11:50:22

Predominant Role of Bacterial Pneumonia as a Cause of Death in Pandemic Influenza: Implications for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness 

The majority of deaths in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria. Less substantial data from the subsequent 1957 and 1968 pandemics are consistent with these findings. If severe pandemic influenza is largely a problem of viral-bacterial copathogenesis, pandemic planning needs to go beyond addressing the viral cause alone (e.g., influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs). Prevention, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia, as well as stockpiling of antibiotics and bacterial vaccines, should also be high priorities for pandemic planning.

It’s a double edged sword though. There’s the mandatory curriculum for boards - and then their is the stuff that is important but not board relevant- and there’s just not enough time for it all. So our schedule has 4x a week 7-8 hours of lecture, with the 5th being 4 hours. Not good for our mental health and my classmates are not doing well as is. Not sure what the solution is.

Below is the entirety of the methods section.

**Methods**

Experimental Design: This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
NCT01906424. Subjects were invited to participate in the study based on the following
Inclusion and Exclusion criteria.
Inclusion Criteria: 1) Age > 18 years; 2) Spinal cord injury 1 or more years prior; 3) AIS A, B
and C; 4) Non progressive traumatic SCI at C7 (vertebral level) or higher; 5) Ability to
commit to 12 week participation; 6) Stable medical condition without cardiopulmonary disease or dysautonomia that would contraindicate participation in upper extremity
rehabilitation or testing activities; 7) Not dependent on ventilation support; 8) No painful
musculoskeletal dysfunction, unhealed fracture, pressure sore, or urinary tract infection
that might interfere with upper extremity rehabilitation or testing activities; 9) No clinically
significant depression or ongoing drug abuse; 10) Adequate social support network to be
able to participate in weekly training and assessment sessions for the duration of the 12
week study period; 11) No current anti-spasticity regimen; 12) Must not have received
Botox injections in the prior six months; 13) Limited use upper extremity for functional
tasks.
Exclusion Criteria: 1) Pregnancy; 2) No functional segmental reflexes below the lesion.
From those that qualified, a select group were asked to complete a pre-screening
questionnaire by phone interview; from those who qualified in the interview, 11 were
selected to undergo a neurological and electrophysiological evaluation out of which 8
subjects (SCI AIS-B (n = 3) and AIS-C (n = 5)) qualified for the study. Neurological
evaluations by the team physician included testing sensory (soft touch via Q-tip and pin
prick) and motor scores. All subjects signed an informed consent form which was approved
by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
Six of the 8 subjects completed the trial. 452495 discontinued due to a UTI and 259463
discontinued due to educational obligations after 4 sessions.
For each subject, 3 baseline sessions were conducted over a period of 10 days including:

1) Neurophysiological tests (spinally evoked potentials, 1Hz with a 1ms pulse
width and monophasic waveform) to determine recruitment profiles of
proximal and distal motor pools with increasing stimulation intensity ranging
from 10mA to 200mA (or if noted to be uncomfortable)

2) Hand grip with Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) without stimulation

3) Identifying appropriate stimulation parameters for each site of stimulation
(30Hz, 1ms pulse width, biphasic waveform (AIS C) or monophasic waveform
(AIS B))

4) Efficacy of one site vs a second site vs combined two-site stimulation in
generating a MVC based on stimulation parameters identified in step # 3.

At the end of the baseline sessions, the formal 4-week intervention program (2 sessions/week) using a proprietary multichannel transcutaneous stimulator to neuromodulate the spinal cord began. Each session consisted of 1-2hr/day including a series of voluntary hand grip tasks, beginning without tEmc, followed by series of 18 attempts to generate an MVC (for ~5 secs) for each hand with tEmc. At the end of the session, MVCs were repeated without tEmc.

At the end of the intervention, 6 subjects that completed the study underwent final
neurological, functional and electrophysiological evaluation. Functional changes associated
with “Quality of Life” were self-reported by all subjects before every session. Of special
note, during and between all sessions, no adverse events were reported. The stimulation
intensity used caused no discomfort of concern to the patients, did not negatively affect
their breathing patterns, heart rate or blood pressure, cause any adverse skin reaction at
the stimulation site nor result in any adverse effects on severity of self-reported spasticity.

tEmc stimulation protocol: The experiments were carried out with use of a proprietary
non-invasive Transcutaneous Electrical Spinal Cord Stimulator (NeuroRecovery Technologies INC). During baseline and final evaluation, each subject was evaluated for functional responses to single versus two-site stimulation. In each case, it was noted that applying stimulation simultaneously at two sites was consistently more effective. This finding was consistent with previous studies of lower extremity function showing that multisite spinal cord stimulation using tEmc was more effective than single site stimulation for inducing involuntary stepping movements7, 8. With this determination, we delivered transcutaneous stimulation simultaneously at two sites along the midline between spinous processes C3-C4 and C6-C7 during every interventional session. The intensity of stimulation at each spinal level was adjusted sufficiently to enable maximal grip strength when applied in isolation, without causing discomfort (range: 10-250mA). Tonic EMG responses from proximal and distal muscles along with MVC forces were observed to optimize the stimulation intensity. Further, the stimulation parameters were also adjusted based on patient feedback. Stimulation was continuously delivered using 2.0 cm-diameter hydrogel adhesive electrodes (Axelgaard, ValuTrode® Cloth) as cathodes and two 5.0 x
10.0 cm2 rectangular electrodes (Axelgaard, ValuTrode® Cloth) placed symmetrically on the skin over the iliac crests as anodes. tEmc was delivered using biphasic or monophasic rectangular 1.0-ms pulses at a frequency of 30Hz, with each pulse filled with a carrier frequency of 10 kHz (Table 1). Note, since this was a proof of concept study, the patients were made aware when the stimulation was turned on to check for any adverse events.

EMG Recording: Muscle activity was recorded from select proximal (Bicep Brachia) and distal (Flexor Digitorium and Extensor Digitorium) muscles via surface EMG electrodes (LabChart and PowerLab, ADInstruments). Data were recorded and sampled at a rate of 10 kHz and were analyzed using LabChart software. EMG data were filtered using a 60-Hz notch filter and a Butterworth bandpass filter of 10 to 1000 Hz. Peak-to-Peak analysis were conducted using the LabChart software to analyze spinally evoked EMG responses. The EMG data were filtered, rectified to analyze area under the curve during MVC tasks to calculate the integrated EMG (iEMG). 

Hand Grip Function: Over the course of the 1-2 hr. training session, the subjects performed 2 tasks, 1) Maximum voluntary contraction (isometric) to assess and train for grip strength; 2) Voluntary rhythmic efforts of submaximal contraction (isometric) to evaluate and train for opening and closing one’s hand, equivalent to squeezing / grasping and releasing objects (voluntary movement). Each voluntary rhythmic effort maneuver was performed for 10-30 seconds (one every one to two seconds) and was repeated 18 times with each hand (left and right) over a 1-2 hr. period. The size and shape of the transducer easily accommodated the variety of hand sizes. Due to the isometric nature of the contraction, the transducer allowed subjects to train for gripping, grasping, and squeezing using primarily their forearm muscles. We found that the isometric device made it was more feasible to minimize forces that could be contributed by the subject’s shoulder and upper arm muscles compared to when pulling a spring-loaded grip device 3, 9. In addition, the subjects were instructed and closely monitored to assure that a neutral wrist position was maintained while performing the maximum voluntary efforts and voluntary rhythmic efforts to avoid any compensatory mechanisms such as tenodesis. The possibility of the transfer of forces emanating from movements of the more proximal arm, shoulder and trunk muscles was also monitored for each effort, followed by examining video recordings. (Supplementary Fig 2).

Statistical analyses: All data are reported as mean ± SEM. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine overall differences across time. Wilcoxon matched-paired signed rank test was used as a post-hoc test to identify difference between “tEmc Off” and “tEmc On” on a day-to-day basis. Mann Whitney U test was used to determine individual differences between “tEmc On” vs “tEmc Off” at preintervention and post intervention and between “tEmc Off” and “tEmc On” at preintervention vs. post-intervention. Coeficient of variation (cv) was calculated to determine consistency of responses at baseline. The criterion for statistical difference was set at P < 0.05 for all comparisons.

I don't see starving children debating the merit of alternative mindsets when they literally can't develop due to malnutrition.  

Let's keep this in the context that you have free will, your needs are met and you have the ability to analyze and redirect your path to some degree.

k128vc,"I feel you, it is hard and it does take time. I'm not a professional or an expert but it sounds like you're holding yourself to the expectation that you ""should"" achieve a resolution or a state of peace and getting upset with yourself when you don't achieve that outcome. You're not giving yourself space to be exist and feel without judgment. You're upset with yourself when you attempt to deal with these feelings and but also upset with yourself for ignoring them when you become overwhelmed. No matter what you do you're still beating yourself up not doing it ""right"".

You've put yourself in a position where the only acceptable outcome is for the feelings/issue to be resolved so that you can be done with it. In simple terms you want it to be over. However, most things that cause us mental distress are not things that will be resolved easily or at all. It helps to accept where you are and that it may take a long time to get to where you want to be. 

Mindful meditation is great tool to help with this but when you practice you want to give yourself space to reflect passively/objectively without holding any expectations for a resolution or outcome. This comes with observing the emotions and thoughts that arise without judgment of yourself. You are permitted to feel negative feelings or think negative thoughts.The meditation is a chance to evaluate these thoughts and feelings in an attempt to understand them, it is not an avenue to rid yourself of them. 

In meditation its about accepting that these emotions and thoughts arise and that you felt them, from there you can decide to further explore them or choose to let them pass without further thought. Its important to understand that you may not reach a satisfactory resolution or even understand your feelings within your meditation but that's ok.

Negative thoughts, emotions, and experiences are inevitable and even if you get past one another is sure to arise in the future. It's the way you choose to deal with and process them that you can learn to do in a healthy productive way. A mental health journey take a lifetime, have compassion and patience for yourself. ♥️",2020-11-26 15:13:17

885uy7,"I wonder if there is some nanotechnology lab out there that has made a violin only a few atoms long, especially for larks who had to take a class or two in the afternoon. The horror! 

Maybe the article doesn't specifically say ""school starts too early"" in these exact words. What it does say though is that owls are especially vulnerable to the social jet lag which is basically the same.

It also has a chart in which larkness is cut off at a 3-hour westward jet lag, vs. the 90° eastward journey (6 hours) the most extreme night owls are forced to make every weekday. The decline in GPA is also steeper for those traveling to the east than for those flying west. This implies that the socially acceptable starting hours favor larks by far.

Now these should be enough to force a societal change... BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE!

First, the lark:finch:owl ratio among humans is 15:60:25, so society favors a 15% minority and discriminates against 25%, which is quite unfair.

And second, the effects of social jet lag are very different for larks and owls. For larks it's simply reduced performance in the evening hours, but most owls spend their (our) lives in chronic sleep deprivation which is associated with a higher risk of basically every mental and physical disease known to man.

But they got left in for now because many highly placed people on the DSM committee make their living as personality disorder experts, soooo 🤷‍♂️

People also need to understand the difference between having personality disorder “traits” and the actual “disorder.” I don’t think anyone would argue that publicly Trump appears to display many Narcissistic *traits.* But a diagnosis of NPD requires the personality traits to cause significant impairment in functioning, and politics aside, I don’t know that you can say that someone capable of getting themselves elected President has an impairment in functioning. His family appears to love and support him, people who align with him politically seem to support him and overall have felt he’s doing a good job. The left behaved much the same way about W during his administration as they do about Trump, so their input isn’t helpful. If you remove the politics, he seems pretty functional actually, and I don’t think would meet criteria for true NPD, but of course I haven’t examined him so can’t say for sure.",2020-04-30 11:18:52

ikuz9f,"They are right. Fomites is the technical term but there is a bit of a grey area in terms of what is droplet transmission and what is fomites. What I presented earlier still ""technically"", fall under droplet because of the time frame. Fomites refer to surfaces being contaminated for a longer period of time. What I explained earlier refers to a droplet falling out of a person's mouth, landing somewhere (still as a droplet) and being picked up. In that instance it's the droplet that carries the infectious agent. For fomites it's more about surfaces being contaminated for a longer term, even after the droplet dried.

These distinctions matter mostly to scientists when we classify different desinfection methods but have little impact for the general public. The WHO is obviously right in reporting that fomites aren't a major source of transmission since (st my latest scan of the current literature at least) doesn't last very long on dry surfaces.

Also, asking about hypothetical pain is absolute nonsense. Pain cannot be imagined. They would have done better to ask about past personal pain. 


>the researchers asked 33 clinical psychologists, undergrad and graduate clinical trainees to rate the supportiveness of statements made by therapists in therapy training videos.

>Rather – and likely for highly complex reasons – we each have an idiosyncratic take on who is supportive and which words we find most helpful.

Practicing writing, or any motor skill, is tremendously important for brain development in children. Motor development and brain development work in tandem and the more a child practices something the more the brain prunes unnecessary neurons to form neuron superhighways for that skill.

Edit: Nothing against social workers but they aren’t always properly educated in the underlying structure of the population that they work with.

mur1o9,"University entomologist and beekeeper here. This is overall pretty shoddy, but let's just start at the top.

First, the title is fairly misleading of ""Roundup causes high levels of mortality following contact exposure in bumble bees"". Meanwhile in the abstract

> Bees exhibited 94% mortality with Roundup® Ready‐To‐Use® and 30% mortality with Roundup® ProActive®, over 24 hr. Weedol® did not cause significant mortality, demonstrating that the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not the cause of the mortality. 

Basically, glyphosate or the thing the makes product ""Roundup"" really wasn't in play, but the authors still tried to grab headlines with that. Instead, the point to the surfactant, and yes, if you douse animals in a detergent, they generally don't respond well. That's the thing to keep in mind too, the surfactant is basically a detergent. It's the dose the makes the poison for anything. In this case, we've known soapy water sprayed directly on insects kills them and can act as an insecticide. Does makes the poison, but route of exposure also matters.

Worse is that they directly applied the mixture to the bees themselves. This generally isn't happening in most settings, and is what we call ecological relevance in toxicity testing. Often times poorly done lab studies just have their insect in a dish or some other unrealistic condition. Then when it comes to actual application in agricultural fields, this is pretty much being done for corn and soybeans where you are generally not seeing many bees in the first place. You're usually looking at one post-emergence treatment a year too, generally when the plants are not even flowering.

When studies actually look for potential effects in cases like this, they're more interested in contact assays (walking onto a treated leaf) or in the case of pesticides like glyphosate that are systemic in the plant, exposure to concentrations found in pollen or nectar. Those are typically much lower than what you'd find coming straight out a spray bottle or agricultural sprayer.

Others have commented on it in this thread before I have, but this basically reads a very poorly thought out study that really isn't based on much for data, but instead tries to grab headlines with minimal data and handwaving to dismiss normal requirements for an insect toxicity paper. It's more narrative than anything else.",2021-04-20 21:02:19
mur1o9,"Worth mentioning that “roundup” is not just glyphosate - this phenomenon is most likely not the glyphosate itself, but one of the many surfactants (used in the spray formulation to get it to stick to and penetrate the plant leaf rather than miss the target completely)- insects and surfactants are rarely a good combo (hence the whole concept of insecticidal soap, used extensively in certified-organic pest control protocols) 

A whole lot of the effects of “Roundup” are more easily attributed to surfactants than the active ingredient itself (which is quite benign to most organisms that aren’t plants). 

The article even points out that it’s not the glyphosate: 

*Bees exhibited 94% mortality with Roundup® Ready‐To‐Use® and 30% mortality with Roundup® ProActive®, over 24 hr. Weedol® did not cause significant mortality, demonstrating that the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not the cause of the mortality. The 96% mortality caused by Roundup® No Glyphosate supports this conclusion.*


And here’s where it gets really murky: Current EPA regulations do not require disclosure of the specific “others” (ingredients other than the active ones) in a pesticide - and the MSDS will usually vaguely indicate “proprietary surfactant” or other types of adjuvants used. Some of those can be far more environmentally problematic than the active ingredient itself. But since they don’t act as a pesticide against the target organism, they don’t need to be disclosed, even if they happen to cause collateral damage to non-target organisms such as bees. 

Adjuvants still play an important role in the formulation of a pesticide, however - in the case of Roundup, the more you can get to stick to the plant, the less of it you have to spray... losing 90% of it to the soil isn’t helping anyone - for some pesticides, that means more runoff (in the case of Roundup, less so, as it’s broken down by soil bacteria in a matter of a few days). 

A few decades ago, it was estimated that 95% of all active pesticide ingredients *missed* their target organisms. We’ve gotten a hell of a lot better about that since then.",2021-04-20 18:29:25
mur1o9,">Weedol® did not cause significant mortality, demonstrating that the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not the cause of the mortality.

mur1o9,"Exactly, and the authors make an important qualify early in the Introduction:

> Its low toxicity to the majority of non‐target organisms (EFSA, 2015a), has led to most regulatory regimes placing minimal restrictions on its application (Beckie et al., 2020). Bee exposure to glyphosate is poorly characterised, although it is known to be extensive, with surveys finding that 59% of honey samples had glyphosate present above the limit of detection, with a mean of 64 ppb (Rubio et al., 2014). 

Further:

>. We predict that the GBHs will cause moderate mortality with direct exposure, in line with Abraham et al. (2018). 

Further, it seems like, based on their description and methodology, that they were doing a lot of direct-exposure work. While they emphasize that much of the concern is with off-site drift onto flowering plants:

>(...)there is no requirement to avoid application of the product when bees are foraging on flowering weeds in treated crops” (Roundup® ProActive Environmental Information Sheet, 2020).

Well, many growers spray outside of pollinator active hours, and herbicide formulations don't exactly avoid breaking down. I think including more data about the concentration of the different components in the pollen would have been necessary, but given that they admit here: 

>As glyphosate does not cause such mortality via contact or oral exposure (EFSA, 2015b), the mortality seen in this experiment is likely to be driven by co‐formulants. 

You would have to know how much of the co-formulants are in the reproductive organs of the plant, but given their emphasis on the surfactants, I don't think this should have that effect since it mostly comes down to the matting of the fur and what not.


I don't feel qualified enough to really assess their methodology. Direct-spray does seem to be a bit questionable as I don't think this is a great test of actual conditions, but the at LEAST they included somewhat of a concentration gradient.",2021-04-20 18:34:46

So I guess the answer is no, it depends on what sort of a fluid is sprayed on them. It's not even the herbicide because all three of those have the same herbicide in them.

This part of the discussion gives a decent overview of why simply saying ""Roundup causes"" is precise and accurate:

The agricultural product Roundup® ProActive also caused significant mortality, although over a longer time period. Interestingly, Roundup® No Glyphosate caused 96% mortality while the generic GBH Weedol® did not significantly increase mortality. Together, this demonstrates that the co‐formulants in these Roundup® products, not the active ingredient glyphosate, are driving mortality. ""

Pesticides have received significant attention from the public and policymakers due to their apparent detriment to non‐target organisms, such as pollinators, but this attention has largely focused on insecticides. A recent systematic review found that only 29 studies had tested the effects of herbicides on bees (Cullen et al., [2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0010)). Additionally, research into herbicides relative to insecticides is disproportionate to their usage, with, for example, 24 times more herbicide applied in the United Kingdom than insecticide in 2018 (FERA, [2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0019)).

For most classes of pest, pesticide usage varies by crop and region, with a range of active ingredients being employed (Garthwaite et al., [2016a](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0021),[b](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0022)). However, herbicides are unique in that one substance, glyphosate, is applied at a far greater rate than any alternative (FERA, [2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0019)). In 2014, 826 million kilograms of glyphosate were applied globally (Benbrook, [2016](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0006)), accounting for around 20% of all pesticide application (Benbrook, [2016](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0006); FAOSTAT, [2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0018)). Glyphosate (applied in products called glyphosate‐based herbicides—GBHs) has a favourable toxicity profile as a broad‐spectrum herbicide, being the only herbicide to target the shikimate pathway (Duke, [2018](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0013)). Its low toxicity to the majority of non‐target organisms (EFSA, [2015a](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0016)), has led to most regulatory regimes placing minimal restrictions on its application (Beckie et al., [2020](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0005)). Bee exposure to glyphosate is poorly characterised, although it is known to be extensive, with surveys finding that 59% of honey samples had glyphosate present above the limit of detection, with a mean of 64 ppb (Rubio et al., [2014](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0051)).

High acute doses (oral and contact) of glyphosate, applied as the active ingredient (glyphosate) alone, or in a single representative formulation (MON 52276 commercially called Roundup® Bioflow in Italian markets (EFSA, [2015b](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0017); Mesnage et al., [2021](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0034)), do not cause mortality in honeybee workers (EFSA, [2015b](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0017)). Consequently, it has passed lower tier testing in the United States and Europe, facilitating its approval in both territories. However, GBHs contain additional components, called co‐formulants, that can have serious, but systematically underestimated risks (Cox & Surgan, [2006](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0009); Mesnage & Antoniou, [2018](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0031); Mullin et al., [2016](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0040)).

Co‐formulants are chemical additives that increase the efficiency of the active ingredient (Hazen, [2000](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0026)). Without co‐formulants, pesticide formulations would be much less effective (Hazen, [2000](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0026)), and more active ingredient would need to be applied, potentially leading to more environmental damage. Most co‐formulants are considered ‘inert’ by regulatory bodies, and thus are not subject to equivalent testing to active ingredients. Consequently, there are no requirements to test their toxicity to bees (EC, [2009](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0014)), meaning that potentially toxic substances are used abundantly (Cox & Surgan, [2006](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0009); Mullin, [2015](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0038); Mullin et al., [2015](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0039)). As they are not tested for in food or environmental residue monitoring programmes (Mesnage et al., [2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0032)), our understanding of their prevalence and environmental fate is highly limited. Bee exposure to these co‐formulants is likely commensurate to that of active ingredients but is poorly studied.

While our understanding of co‐formulant exposure is limited, studies of hazard (i.e. the damage they cause) are more informative. Nagy et al. ([2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0041)) reported that 24 of 36 studies showed formulations to be more toxic in non‐target organisms than active ingredients alone. In human cell lines and rats, Roundup® products specifically were more toxic than the active ingredient alone in five of six studies, with just one study finding equivalent toxicity (Nagy et al., [2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0041)). While only one formulation per active ingredient is typically submitted to the full range of toxicity tests in the EU (EFSA, [2015a](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0016)), dozens of formulations per active ingredient are produced, each with a unique composition posing unique hazards to non‐target organisms (Mesnage et al., [2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0032)). For glyphosate in the United Kingdom there are 284 distinct consumer or agricultural formulations (Health & Safety Executive UK, [2020](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0027)), making it the most formulation diverse AI in the United Kingdom. Co‐formulants present in Roundup® have been found to have sub‐lethal effects in human cell lines (Defarge et al., [2016](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0011); Mesnage et al., [2013](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0033)), demonstrating that they present a relevant hazard to health, although almost nothing is known of their effects on bees (Mullin, [2015](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0038); Mullin et al., [2015](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0039)). One class of co‐formulants, surfactants (surface acting agent), were found in 100% of American honey, pollen and beeswax samples (n = 27; Chen & Mullin, [2014](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0007)), demonstrating their pervasiveness.

Surfactants in herbicides like Roundup® spread the sprayed droplets out over target leaves, increasing glyphosate absorption and toxicity. Surfactants are major co‐formulants in Roundup® products, typically accounting for 15% of the concentrated weight (Mesnage et al., [2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0032)). Surfactants are environmental pollutants that have been shown to have a range of negative impacts on honey bees (Ciarlo et al., [2012](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0008); Fine et al., [2017](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13867?rss=1#jpe13867-bib-0020); Goodwin & McBrydie, [2000](https://besjournals.onli",2021-04-20 20:25:28

Essential workers could send their kids to school but distancing bubbles were in place. Supermarkets chemist vets were open. Essential workers had to self distance and wash hands and avoid touching face. Tracking on phone or registering wherever you went. There were updates every day to tell the public what was happening. It kinda felt like the country was behind a war effort 40% of the work force are essential workers. The biggest challenge: No takeaways cooking at home for a month 😦,2021-01-04 05:32:11

It's getting better now, by necessity and by big money coming in from Google, IBM, and Amazon. 

Main topics you care about in software reg:
- Ownership of protected info (personal PII/ medical PHI)
- Access controls to protected info
- Data retention
- Cybersecurity (biggest one right now, cause of the ransomware attacks everywhere)
- Data formats, seriously
- International transfer
- Cloud infrastructure obligations for all the above

THEN, if on top of that you add on anything that allows for a medical diagnosis, you unlock a massive tier of QA and risk assessment requirements that most software shops just aren't set up for. And no hardware shops are set up for hardcore software QA and dev.

I completely get this frustration, because it's a huge pet peeve of mine too - but you have it backwards. The problem isn't that the media treats people who are 37 as kids, it's that the media doesn't understand what ""millennial"" means in the first place - they think it just means ""young people"".

Case in point: there was an article recently saying ""more millennials are living at home than in 2000"". Yeah, right, more of us are living at home then when we were ages 4-18 🙄. I've seen other articles talking about ""millennials"" who are still in high school.

I couldn’t find one on YouTube that day.

All I found where ones of politicians trying to tell scientists how things where.

Also the Republican Party was all in on fighting global warming up until the cap and trade bill got introduced. Then they flipped on a dime to opposing it.  

There was some video on YouTube that played like the past how many years since it first got reporting on it and showed quick clips of it with headlines on the tv and i was surprised fox was supportive of fighting global warming.  Then it got to cap and trade and 💥 it flipped from there on out to today.



Something to ponder- I read this before coming here and I kinda wondered if it needs to be part of the strategy. As I look at the whole political process and it’s the lowest EQ mess I have ever seen.
We also need to be able to explain it in stories about personal experiences going through it.

>	Running increases plasma levels of β-endorphin (an opioid) and anandamide (an endocannabinoid) in mice and men (4, 5). However, unlike the lipophilic anandamide, β-endorphin cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, rendering central effects of pe- ripheral opioids unlikely. In an attempt to disentangle the bio- mechanism of a runner’s high, we were using a combination of pharmacologic, molecular genetic, and behavioral studies in mice, and demonstrated for the first time to our knowledge that a runner’s high depends on cannabinoid receptors in mice.

As soon as I learned about Covid-19,I was very worried considering I already did everything I could to avoid getting the flu and other colds,and the fact that Covid-19 was even more contagious,made me be even more diligent about avoiding others.

The same people that won’t cover their face when sneezing,coughing, or even try to wash their hands when sick,are the exact same people that won’t wear a mask,and that won’t give anyone any consideration to just back up off people and stop crowding them out while they have a fever or cold.

Take Vit-D,get your flu shot,and stay the hell away from the assholes that won’t wear masks.You can almost guarantee that those people are walking snotballs with poor manners,and their own private parts and feces on their hands.

9bg654,"Saying that men are more or less likely to report means you have an idea of the proportion of abuse reported among all the abuses against men. However, in this case it could just be that men are far more likely to be victims of abuse (although abuse against women is often more damaging) but only a small number report them, yet those reports out number the reports made by women. 
The figures could be like this
Total number of assaults against: 
- men: 10,000
-women: 5,000
Reported assaults:
-men: 6,000 (60% of the assaults)
-women: 4,500 (90% of the assaults).
See here we would see that men are less likely to report but more likely to be victims.

Anecdotally, all my female friends who have been diagnosed with BPD (which to be fair is only 3 people) all seem *incredibly* ADHD to me. It's actually one of the reasons I get on so well with them.  
   
Non-adhd women often find me too intense and my friendships with them are usually short lived or strained. However with ADHD women it's the opposite, it's like we're suddenly best friends and soulmates. I've read that ADHD people tend to attract other ADHD people when it comes to friends and relationships and that's definitely been my experience of it too.    
    
But when I have talked to my BPD diagnosed friends about ADHD, they either know very little about it or they only know the stereotypes about it which are all relating to boys / young men.

 As an accused nerd, I keep up with literature, but am not claiming that makes me an expert at all, it's not my current profession.....

Personality disorders are generally thought of in the literature more as learned behaviors, whereas something like schizophrenia is more biologically based. Not sure exactly what was said to you, but I would guess the mindset is ' you can't just take meds and fix your problem, it takes effort.'
While Schizophrenia is best treated with medicine. 

You have to admit to your self you have these improper coping mechanisms and work towards fixing them. You're on the right track with saying 'i have it myself' many with personality disorders can't even say that. 

Barring some comorbidity I don't know about, I do believe you can revert improper coping mechanisms, it's just not easy unfortunately. Keep working at it though, your future self will thank you 🙂",2020-12-11 04:19:32

kei9n7,"Hi, so for starters, I'm a woman. I know it's not a major issue, but a little pet peeve of mine 😂
I also handle working dogs for a living, as well as training pets on occasion. 

By corrections, I don't mean shocking, hitting etc. I mean something that will redirect the dogs attention back to me when they're maybe slightly over stimulated, and will let the dog know that the behaviour they are displaying is undesirable. For some dogs that could be a verbal cue, such a cesar milans famous tsk noise. Other dogs, a gentle pop on the leash is enough. It should NEVER hurt the dog. 

In an ideal world, everything could be solved with love and treats, but not every situation can be. I very VERY sparingly use corrections with my dogs. It's important for them to be able to process a stressor. If your dog is shutting down because of a correction, then there's a problem. Either with the dog or with the way the correction is given. 

If I issue a correction, my dogs will look to me for direction, which allows me to point them in the direction of the desired behaviour and I can then jackpot them with treats. I never issue a correction out of anger or frustration, I just change my approach to see if it's a communication error, which it generally is. 

I respect all schools of thought on this, however, and I will not judge another person's training methods unless they're blatantly abusive.

Just staring seems to cause them to freeze momentarily and stare back, then as soon as you avert your gaze they continue with their Machiavellian plan, like a sinister game of grandmothers footsteps, 

A technique I have found to be more effective is that whilst staring them down (with an intense piercing gaze locked right on the centre of their pupil), I try to mentally convey great physical threat toward them.

Dude, Mexico is in North America 

And science does have an idea, the amount of geological literature written on the subject is extensive

Also a bit extra, Palaeontologists deals with the study of ancient life, the reason palaeontologists disagree on whether dinosaurs have feathers is because we are constantly learning and discovering new evidence about how the dinosaurs looked and lived, and as we discover new things about them our understanding of the way they looked changes, one of the major discoveries was some evidence that at least some dinos did have feathers as we have find more fossils and info our understanding will change further. 
A bit of a tangent but palaeontology is really cool and interesting :)

My non scientific sense. Is that left and right positions, in normal people are representative of a primary orientation in either their heart or balls/ovaries. 

Of course too much ""love"" can be as damaging as too much ""pragmatism"".

Part of our journey to maturity includes integrating the heart and balls/ovaries (men's work terminology 🤷), for both parts to balance and support each other. To learn to embody and act from love AND strength, openness AND boundaries, idealism AND pragmatism.

There are lunatics on both sides of the fence, especially at the extremes.

But most people whichever side they inhabit are fundamentally good people, and articles like this just deepen the already exaggerated divide.

For both sides. One reflects the shadow of the other.

The crisis we face is the loss of real eldership, of genuine maturity and integration, moved beyond dualistic ways of thinking. (both sides guilty)

There is a third way, the path of integration, involving the ability to integrate shadow, to live in the tension of the crossroads of two seemingly opposed positions.

bl0x4h,"I don't really see how it's possible for a cyclist to be in *more* danger from cars when cycling on a sidewalk. Unless the car jumps the curb, the only place where a collision should be expected to occur is when the bicyclist is crossing a crosswalk and a car turns right or left into them:

       │   │
    ───┘   └───
          ┌→X
    ───┐  │┌↑──
       │  │││
         🚗🚲

How is that situation any different than a right-turning car hitting a cyclist in a bike lane?

     │     │
    ─┘     └──
        ┌→X
    ─┐  │ ↑┌──
     │  │ ││
       🚗🚲

The only difference is that the cyclist in the bike lane is a few feet to the left. The cyclist on the sidewalk should be just as safe as the pedestrian as long as they cross when they have a signal. A car hitting them in this situation should be in the wrong, and in both cases it's a low-speed collision unless the car is being reckless and turning at speed. 

The only other way for the cyclist to cross the intersection would be to cut across the flow of traffic:

       │   │
       │  X←─🚲
    ───┘  ↑└───
          │  
    ───┐  │┌───
         🚗 

This would be just as dangerous and stupid as a pedestrian crossing on ✋ or jaywalking, or a vehicle running the light. A cyclist crossing in a bike lane should be stopped at the red light, and a cyclist on a sidewalk should be stopped waiting for a signal.

With bike lanes, a cyclist turning left at an intersection has to cut across traffic into the left turn lane and share it with cars. They have the same chance of being hit by a turning car while crossing the intersection as a pedestrian. They have to deal with cars straying into the bike lane, opening doors, stopped or parked cars, trash, etc. I don't see how this is safer? I'd much rather run into a pedestrian than be hit by a car or slam into a car door at speed.

And in an ideal world, sure, bike lanes should be separate from both the street and the sidewalk. But you can't just add that space to an existing road without narrowing the road or expanding into properties along the road.",2019-05-06 03:49:05

Personally I do struggle with feeling like I can't get good breaths while wearing it (I do happily anyway and tbh this is the first time I'm expressing that feeling) and have kept quiet  because it does seem a bit dramatic, but I do have extreme claustrophobia🤔🤷‍♀️ 

Anyone else relate?",2020-11-03 06:27:30

kq7jqo,"Today I dropped my daughter at Northwestern University, and I feel very proud about it, though a bit sad of course to say goodbye! Everybody warned her mom and I about the teenage years, and how everything will change and how she will turn against us. Her mom and I are not together, but we always refused to believe all that negativity. Nothing like that happened, we always treated her with love and respect and we asked the same from her. We never spanked or grounded her, she grew up to be empathetic, compassionate, socially skilled and academically successful. ☺️",2021-01-05 01:09:16

My daughter was concerned about this when her brother was baking.... I told her my heart doesn’t get cut in half and half of it is for her and half is for her bother; rather, my heart doubles in size and I hold both of them in it and they both feel all my love. 

It made her feel safe.

The common counter arguments can be summed up as:

• also in countries where the state forces people to lock down, the same effect is only postponed to when lockdown is lifted - unless people accept to live locked forever 

• most deaths here has been in the state run old folks homes, which are very cruel places. If you’re not aware, the Swedish state has incentivised for the 3rd worlds population to immigrate, and is using its government run elderly “care” facilities as integration programmes for these new Swedes. Very little care has been carried out, and the great number of deaths has been occurring in these state run homes for the old. Personally I think it’s cruel that we accept handing mom and dad to the state, a heartless entity interested in nothing but gaining and keeping power. 

These arguments are common here. Personally, I value staying lockdown-free for liberty but it’s more than clear to me that this is a minority opinion in this forum. Again thanks for disagreeing politely 👍

Regarding the first argument in this comment, I would love to hear some counter arguments. I’ve received a lot of angry comments, but none that explains this issue, that lockdowns are just delaying the inevitable. Prove me wrong reddit",2020-10-14 21:55:41

n2fv1n,"Except no private insurance company sold flood insurance, at all, until the government states subsidizing it. The problem with the flood insurance program isn't that it exists - freak floods happen - the problem is that it let's people keep dipping into it.

On paper, it is *supposed* to be a 'one-and-done' policy. After a house gets flooded - say, in a hurricane - insurance pays out, and then that is supposed to be *it* for that property. The issue is it covers the home, not the land. So people take that money, tear down the flooded out house to the ground, and then build a ""Completely, Totally New Home, We Swear™"" on the exact same plot of land, and flood insurance covers it again. Maybe they'll throw in some French Drains in the foundation, possibly a small flood wall, in ""good faith"". As long as they can complete the construction prior to the next flood, they can pretend it's a completely new home and no one could have foreseen yet another flood. These people are abusing the program, and insurance and banks turn a blind eye because having a house on the property is preferable to them than being left with a property that cannot be built upon at all. 

And then you have the people who genuinely *want* to move. They didn't do their due diligence when buying their home, or the flood planes shifted since the purchase, or they were straight up lied to by the developer, and now it floods once or twice a year. They want to sell their house, but who on earth is going to buy it? They can't just walk away from it.

The program ***is*** broken, but flood insurance should exist - even if it takes government subsidies to make it happen. It should be looking how often the geography floods. If the same piece of land floods more than once in 20 years (ish), it should be a 'government buys the property from you using eminent domain, at the value the house had pre-flood', and then restores the land to being a flood plain to help protect houses further up hill from an even bigger flood later.

But that would make sense, so it won't happen.",2021-05-01 15:11:18

Even outside of that, if it’s an hour or two and it’s for a specific good cause (we’re learning this to detect diseases the cause blindness for example).

>A DNA-launched LAV was developed for ZIKV virus (ZIKV), a pathogen that recently caused a global public health emergency. The cDNA copy of a ZIKV LAV genome was engineered into a DNA plasmid. The DNA-LAV plasmid was delivered into mice using a clinically proven device TriGrid™ to launch the replication of LAV.

e0owy0,"So I had a tumor and cyst that was about the size of a tennis ball, right in the middle of my brain. It started growing when I was a teenager, but I didn’t present with noticeable symptoms until I was 30. And I didn’t have headaches until the last month. 

But boy was that a really, really bad month. 

My primary long-term symptom was a...wave...that would go through my vision if I sat up quickly or turned my head side to side quickly. Highly unpleasant, I don’t really know how to describe it. But I still avoid rapid head motions, because of how unpleasant it was. 

I’m also missing a chunk from my left frontal lobe about the size of a ping pong ball, a chunk from the middle about the size of a hackey sack, and a chunk from my right cerebellum about the size of a golf ball. Other than some mild motor impairment on my left side, there’s not really a noticeable difference. Since my surgery I’ve gotten a master’s, two law degrees, and I’m applying for a PhD.

9eslew,"I agree - I find relief for some symptoms more pronounced with a THC + CBD product. Others, CBD alone works. The positive, engaged, motivated type feelings one can get when high can (and should) be used to promote desired change in ones life. So what you're saying about the mental stimulus is true.

And that's what I meant by together vs separate 😊You get ""high"" from THC, CBD is non-psychoactive. So I can smoke a CBD only vape pen all day non-stop and will never get ""high"". The two are synergistic, though, so they both work better when used together.

I kind of wish it was taught to look for a partner whose sex drive matches yours, otherwise there could be trouble. But where I come from most people are obsessed that people marry as virgins. 

I remember being at some party before a friends wedding, i was in one room and i could hear the bride-to-be and friends in another. What i heard was:
""Meg. Meg youre getting married!
""I know i know. Im so excited!""
""Mehhhg you finally get to have SEX!""
""Yea...eh. But thats not important""

I remember thinking ""That poor groom.""
Sex isn't important but almost every married couple i know complains about sex in some way.

Its so not important that people are avoiding sex until they are married, while others are getting married, wait for it, just to have sex.

Its a minefield. As a guy with an abnormally high drive I feel for everyone in the same boat. When you find a match tho, it'll be rad. And none of you friends will believe the answers you give, when they ask what the sex is like 👍",2019-09-15 18:42:35

This is a complete strawman. All I'm saying is that there is a lot of bad research out there. Research is conducted by humans, and humans are biased. That's why you get different researchers researching the same question and coming to different conclusions.

We quarantine all packaged and canned foods. We wipe down refrigerated containers with 70% alcohol before putting them away. As for food delivery, we have rarely done that, and when we DO, we have immediately transferred the food out of the take-out containers, into our own cookware, and re-cook (microwave or oven) all foods before we consume them. We have totally given up any take-out cold foods, such as salads, cole slaw, etc.

Since the beginning of March we've only gone into public when absolutely necessary, and even then we've been super careful about it what we touch, keeping our distance, and always wearing masks. When I say ""absolutely necessary,"" I mean that I don't think we've been out more than a dozen times within that time period.

We literally use hand sanitizer and / or alcohol (70%+) after every surface touched. Including elevator buttons and door handles. Then we come home and put all outer clothing and the masks we were wearing into the washing machine, and do what we call a ""Covid scrub.""

We have been lucky so far. We plan to keep on being vigilant, until the experts are reasonably confident in a vaccine.

d5xpz7,"Well, I actually really like the public school system that I live in.  

But I specifically sought out to live here.  It’s very expensive, and is in the top 5% of the nation performance wise.

A lot of the surrounding areas have over crowded class rooms, are forced to work with over used text books, and have drug problems.

But, as far as saying a kindergartner has a lot of “time” in the day is untrue in my opinion.  And that is coming from a stay at home mom.  

I would imagine working parents have a much more difficult time fitting in *more* school work.

So we live in a rural area.  My daughter gets up at 6:30 AM to eat breakfast and get dressed and ready for school.  She bathes the night before.

If she were to ride the bus, her bus would pick her up at   7:00 AM in order to get to school once it started at 8:16.

I allow her to get more sleep and drive her in myself, we leave the house at 7:30 in order to be on time due to traffic.

Her school lets out at 3:06.

I could let her have over an hour bus ride home, and have her dropped off at 4:30 PM.

Or I can pick her up.  Which means I have to leave the house at 2:30.

If we drive straight home without stopping at the grocery store, we get home at 3:45-4:00 PM.  She always passes out in the car.

Once she is home,  she has to change out of her school clothes, get a snack, and usually has quiet time watching a show or playing with a tablet for about an hour.  

While she is doing this I’m going through her backpack, taking care of any parent “HW” (Like adding lunch money to her account, signing permission slips, adding school events to our calendar, stuff like that) which happens a few times a week and takes me probably 10-20 minutes.

I have an almost 2 year old.  So keep in mind I also am entertaining her, getting her ready, fed, diaper changed, all that stuff simultaneously.  Perhaps a parent of a single child could get these things done quicker.

Then the chores that have to be done no matter what every single night before school is:

Make and eat dinner

Help her pick out her outfit for the next day, so that it isn’t an issue come morning time.

I also lay out my clothes, and her sisters so that we can get ready quickly in the morning and I don’t have to search for anything.

Bathe kids, brush teeth, give bedtime snack, bedtime story.  

Bedtime at 8:00

So I have to get all of that done in the matter of 4 hours after she gets done from school.

If I want to give her an hour to relax and have a snack after being at school all day, now that time goes down to 3 hours.

Eating dinner takes her about 30 minutes.

Bedtime routine takes anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour.  

So that leaves a little more than 2 hours to wrestle my tired Kindergartner to do more school work.

Keep in mind,  During those 2 hours I’m preparing dinner, doing laundry, and setting up the house for another day AND taking care of her sister.

So that is a lot to juggle.  

It’s very easy to get cranky, and impatient.  Both the kids and I.

And when their dad gets home from work, of course he wants to spend some time with them.  Should I tell him sorry, that has to wait until the weekend?

It’s just a lot for a 5-6 year old.  Especially those who didn’t attend pre-K.

And I can’t imagine how tired working parents must be.

She is learning everything so well and quickly anyways, I don’t see any need for HW 🤷🏼‍♀️",2019-09-18 22:09:18

cdugcu,"Thanks 👍. Although I agree with the research presented in the article I would have to put forth the idea that this focuses on interests and career choices, things that are heavily influenced by the culture you grow up in. Perhaps these differences shown are not psychological inclinations but a result of a society that encourages compassion and agreeability in women and intelligence and analytical thought in men? I find it difficult to believe that the internal experiences of men and women differ so vastly naturally, and even if men do innately focus on objects and women on people (which I concede, based on the evidence presented, may be true), I doubt all of this data is purely the result of natural inclination? This is where my problem with these sorts of ideas lie, because even if there are innate differences, they cannot be so influential, and also in a practical sense, when we begin to see men and women as generalisations of behaviours and not the diverse individuals we are, it is a worldview that promotes an “us vs them” dichotomy and can hold back meaningful change in society.",2019-07-16 14:09:47

6j12gu,"There's also an important thing to note about appealing to sexuality in advertising.  You can't just put a woman in skimpy clothing and then call it a day because ""everyone knows sex sells.""

That works for a setup where you're selling a product or service to people who will get to interact with said women.  Hooters can make this work because that's literally their business.

Something like a classy alcohol brand is usually more subtle (well, sometimes).  You'll usually see an ad that just provides some implication that using their product will make you more charming and sophisticated which will draw beautiful women in.

Those are pretty blatantly obvious products that you can sell pretty easily with sex and we typically think of marketing that's clearly geared towards men, but there are a lot of incredibly sexually charged ads targeted towards women.

Bath products are probably the most obvious.  I'm pretty sure everyone's seen an ad that makes showering with a particular product a sensual, sexually fulfilling experience for the woman in the ad.  But more subtly, those types of products really try to associate themselves with being a desirable woman.

Dove's campaign to embrace Real Beauty™ isn't just because they feel a moral compulsion to break down barriers.  They know that if they can create an association between their product and feeling desirable, they've locked in customers.  And, obviously, women who don't conform to impossible standards of beauty is a pretty substantial market.

And then there are food and beverage ads, marketed to men and women, that make eating or drinking their particular product appear to be an almost sexual experience.  Some are certainly more overt, but even the typical ad makes it appear to be a somewhat sensual experience.

Simply put, while the study says it was interested in ads which depicted ""models who were partially or fully nude; models who were engaged in sexual touching or in positions that suggested a sexual encounter was imminent; sexual innuendoes; and sexual embeds, which are partially hidden words or pictures that communicate a sexual message,"" it really feels like they were much more concerned on overt displays.  Human sexuality is a deep and powerful driving force.  It can be tapped into in seemingly innocuous ways to produce a major effect on our thinking.

It sounds like the main takeaway here was that most people don't like it when they are aware that they're being sold on sexual appeal.  But doesn't that apply across the board?  It seems like humans have an adverse reaction to most sorts of blatant manipulation.",2017-06-23 18:38:03

I say how my parents made me, but those 3 men specifically are the reason I’m alive.

n8hu9f,"Eating a Mediterranean diet that is rich in fish, vegetables and olive oil may protect your brain from protein build up and shrinkage that can lead to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a new study. The research is published in the May 5, 2021, online issue of Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The findings applied to people with moderate to severe strokes, not people with mild strokes.

The study looked at abnormal proteins called amyloid and tau. Amyloid is a protein that forms into plaques, while tau is a protein that forms into tangles. Both are found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease but may also be found in the brains of older people with normal cognition.

The Mediterranean diet includes high intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereals, fish and monounsaturated fatty acids such as olive oil, and low intake of saturated fatty acids, dairy products and meat.

“Our study suggests that eating a diet that’s high in unsaturated fats, fish, fruits and vegetables, and low in dairy and red meat may actually protect your brain from the protein build-up that can lead to memory loss and dementia,” said study author Tommaso Ballarini, Ph.D., of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) in Bonn, Germany. “These results add to the body of evidence that show what you eat may influence your memory skills later on.”

The study looked at 512 people. Of those, 169 were cognitively normal, while 343 were identified as being at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

Researchers looked at how closely people followed the Mediterranean diet based on their answers to a questionnaire asking how much they ate of 148 items over the previous month. People who often ate healthy foods typical of the Mediterranean diet, like fish, vegetables and fruit, and only occasionally ate foods non-typical of the Mediterranean diet, like red meat, received the highest scores, for a maximum score of nine.

Cognitive skills were assessed with an extensive test set for Alzheimer’s disease progression that looked at five different functions, including language, memory and executive function. All the participants had brain scans to determine their brain volume. In addition, the spinal fluid of 226 was tested for amyloid and tau protein biomarkers.

Researchers then looked at how closely someone followed the Mediterranean diet, and the relationship to both their brain volume, tau and amyloid biomarkers, and cognitive skills.

After adjusting for factors like age, sex and education, researchers found that in the area of the brain most closely associated with Alzheimer’s disease, every point lower people scored on the Mediterranean diet scale was equal to almost one year of brain aging.

I just did a session on self-limiting beliefs, and discovered I have held this one for a long time. A belief that somehow earthly happiness & abundance are 'unspiritual' and 'selfish' to seek; that only by suffering in some way could I be 'worthy' or 'truly good'. As one could predict, my finances & health have suffered because of this deep subconscious 'rule' I had been following for 28 years, the rule that whatever good happens I must be suffering to be of worth. Last night I participated in a free online session and experienced such success, I am over the moon this morning to see this topic - synchronicity - and feel *enlivened*! What's changed? Outwardly, nothing, I am waking up in the same place to do the same job today I did yesterday. But I can *feel* how different my emotional baseline is - whereas I'm accustomed to a sort or constant low-grade depression & anxiety, this morning I feel ALIVE. All the conditions surrounding me are the same, but they *feel* so different - so new, exciting, satisfying. I woke up with a sense of confidence and security I hadn't known since childhood, since that last adventure of endless summer. Now all that is has begun revealing that same quality, same endless summer feeling... And I am in love. Blessed souls, LOVE yourself and release whatever deep beliefs are limiting you.

d1hktw,"I had a brain tumor removed in 2006, and developed a mild version of Narcolepsy. By 2013, I was spending 55% of my small income as a caregiver for people with disabilities on my healthcare. That included $1,203 per month for refills of my Narcolepsy pills until I reached a $5,000 deductible.

Then the ACA went into full effect. As of last year, I have saved $44,400 over 5 years on my premiums, and deductibles! Now I pay just $45 per month, for twice as many of those same Narcolepsy pills. By the end of this year, I’ll have saved over $54,000 on my premiums, and deductibles!

I am not at all opposed to going to a Single Payer/Medicare For All System (Canada, the UK, & the Scandinavian countries have proven that such systems can work very well. We could improve on them where necessary). But I absolutely cannot afford to go back to the Survival of the Richest System. However, there is a compromise solution that would fix the ACA, and make it work better for everyone. The German Bismarck Model of Private, NONProfit insurance would be a great fit for the US!

Similar systems are already used with great success in Germany, France, and Japan. It works by requiring All Insurers, and All Medical Providers to collectively bargain annually to set the rates for All medical services. Then, when an Insurer gets a bill from a licensed Medical Provider for one of their subscribers, the Insurer must automatically Pay the Damn Bill!!

No Provider Networks. No Prior Authorizations. No State Lines. No 🐂💩!!

A government agency, like the FDA, would oversee the Medical Providers to prevent fraudulent billing. But Insurers would no longer have a profit motive, or even the ability, to deny payment for legitimate medical expenses. The government would perform the role of a neutral, third party arbiter, with no ability to take campaign contributions from either Insurers, or Medical Providers. Just calling “balls & strikes.”

The IRS would closely monitor Insurers to guarantee that they function as True NONProfits. Excess premium collections would either be refunded directly to subscribers, or could be used to help fund a reinsurance pool for Insurers with unexpectedly high medical benefit costs (similar to how the FDIC works for banks). To encourage competition, Insurers with the most subscribers, and the best consumer satisfaction ratings could receive a bonus percentage of the premiums for salary bonuses.

A Public Option to buy into the Medicaid/Medicare system should also be available to act as a pace car of sorts on the Private Insurers. The trade off is that All citizens must be required to take Personal Responsibly for their own potential healthcare liabilities by obtaining, and maintaining meaningful Health Insurance. It is simply impossible to adequately cover Preexisting Conditions if Patients can simply wait until they’re sick to get coverage.

Employers would be required to pay All of their Employees at least a Living Wage* that would include the costs of getting healthcare coverage. They could continue to provide adequate coverage options, or encourage Employees to form Co-Ops that function as NONProfits, with a focus on providing quality healthcare for the Employees.

*A wage that is adequate for any Employee who works full time hours (for one, or multiple Employers) can afford the costs of all of their essential goods & services. That wage would be determined in each community by a Consumer Price Index of those goods & services. As prices increase, wages would have to automatically rise to keep pace.",2019-09-09 06:10:21

Like, I facepalm any time someone says that vaccines keep you from getting sick 🙄 um no, they help your body respond better if you do get the bug, so you don't get as seriously sick. it's not some magic bubble that keeps the bug from ever entering your body. 

The flip side is that parents can see better how their kid is developing and how they respond to vaccines over days, weeks, months after getting them. There are actual, real risks to them, and horror stories involving doctors who don't take that seriously, and the kid is maimed or dies. That really can happen, even if it doesn't happen to most of us. No matter which action a parent chooses, there will be some risk, and I think we'd do better to stop condescending and start giving actually good info, we'd be better off. 

But no state should be able to force parents to get their kids vaccinated, cos a kid doesn't have to have an official immunodeficiency to have a bad reaction to a vaccine. People (including parents) should be able to make that choice themselves.",2019-07-04 23:45:58

Size is dictated by oxygen levels and other factors in fish. Also an increase in oxygen levels would allow for a faster healing rate of cells meaning most organisms could live longer. 

My understanding of reptiles is they never stop growing. Given a longer life span, more food and an increase in oxygen for growth, it is entirely plausible that things were larger.

bw9a6y,"Interesting. Well, in terms of neurology, there is pruning of neurons in brain, where less prevalent/important ""ideas"" deteriorate over time and die off. Sets of neurons firing may change or adapt as new information comes in. 

A more superficial example is, the act of accepting the situation, but recognizing how unhelpful it is to recollect a certain thought. If we continue to recollect, then we also must come to an understanding that if the idea is good or bad. If it is fixable, then once we ""fix"" it, the individual will remind themself, ""this is the best I can do under these circumstances."" (This is where anxiety develops if the individual cannot move on).

In terms of sociology, the best an individual can do is be true to thyself, yet understand the world at large and their specific role (this topic is a philosophical topic). Thus, there is no right answer on how to socialize, but there is a way to alleviate stresses while socializing.

Back to the original point, the fact that if an individual thinking less of a certain idea/moment, the more likely the memory gets put in ""archives."" It's still there, but just not as readily available due to other ""current/recurring"" ideas that solidifies in its place.

😀 Correct me if I'm wrong, hopefully, I can replace it with my current understanding of brain mechanics.

To this day I still feel the same about the number 8 and it’s hard to explain. I’ve since grown an affinity for 6-digit numbers and find it really easy to remember them. It’s actually harder for me to forget them. 

Certain combinations of 6-digit numbers are very “satisfying” to me.. I can’t fully explain why. I like when the fourth number is a 0 or if there are repeating digits next to each other. 

It’s like my curse... I’m also very shy and introverted and this is something I’ve never shared with anyone. People at work would ask me how I remember a number and I just shrug and say idk. I sometimes wonder if I’m on the spectrum but I don’t know how to go about getting evaluated.

For comparison, I spent 5 years after med school doing psychiatry. Your family doctor did a single six week rotation in psychiatry during medical school (during with they probably took a 1 week vacation) and that’s likely all, unless they did an elective later in med school. Many family docs learn more mental health treatment on their own obviously, and some are VERY good, but it’s different than what we do, which is ALL psychiatry, all the time.  

Will insurance cover it?  I’m going to assume you’re in the US. In general, yes. If you can find a psychiatrist that takes your insurance. 90% or so of psychiatrists don’t take insurance since the reimbursement from insurance is sooooo low (which they do on purpose. If they pay us so little that no one takes it, they don’t have to pay anything, best trick huh 😡). Otherwise you have to pay cash out of pocket. Which is worth it if you find a good doc. I pay for my daughter to see a private psychiatrist out of network. If you can’t do that financially, then your local academic medical center is probably your best bet.

dti2al,"It's funny how ""Big Dairy"" never cared in the least about milk of magnesia, and even coconut milk got a pass for most of modern history... But suddenly people are daring to *primarily* consume white sweetish liquids made from \*gasp\* *plants* rather than cows, and we have the ADA/NDC/NMPF beating down the FDA's door demanding they crack down on this truth™-in-labeling crisis?

One could *almost* get the idea that it has nothing to do with truth or safety, and is just a bunch of greedy bastards ""milking"" their regulatory capture for all it's worth.",2019-11-08 22:23:59

No i don't know😉, but i always thought sign language could have been universal but it's not. So you can actually be bilingual in that too. (Or trilingual, multilingual...)",2020-10-02 14:17:38

iddt59,"I’m white but I’ve got some curly kinky thick hair.

I’ve used white girl hair products , black girl hair products ... anything to try and tame the mane...

One day I was at the gym and asked a lady what she does to keep her curls looking so good and she laughed and said “honey, this is my gym wig”

I will say sheltering at home has given me the best curls because all I’ve done is just washed my hair, no products since I haven’t had to go into office! 

This is an interesting prescriptive though because I get more compliments on my curls than I do if I go straight ... maybe I just look bad with straight hair 😂",2020-08-20 22:02:01

iddt59,"This is 💯 % accurate. Also this is how most American white employers see you.

Blondes get better everything than brunettes because they find blondes more attractive even if that person isn't smarter than a monkey.

Taller men get better everything than short men even if that person is dumber than a rock.

I have worked with some of the most idiotic people on earth and they have hold much much higher position than I at the workplace.
