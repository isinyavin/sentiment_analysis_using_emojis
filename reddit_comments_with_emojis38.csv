jun85a,Only an homage 🙂,2020-11-15 23:15:20
jun85a,"Yeah I mean the idea is portable for sure; all that is needed is an API to list streams for.

Looks like DLive needs you to apply to the dev program and the docs are a little lacking. The other trick is that unless there's a way to query by stream viewer count you need to page through the API a WHOLE lot which could cause rate limiting issues (I'm small fry for a huge site like Twitch but could bump up against issues on smaller platforms).

Do you work with DLive? I'm unclear on what I can and can't actually query on their API; GraphQL is not my typical mental model so I may just not understand fully 🙂",2020-11-16 02:54:39
jun85a,Awwww this means so much to me! I'm so glad you appreciate it and best of luck with your streams! 🤗,2020-11-16 03:55:26
jun85a,Oh interesting; I wasn't aware of that and no certainly no one has reached out. I suppose that makes sense in terms of concept but ten seconds of scrolling in the app and I'm deep into zero viewer territory on very popular games so I'm skeptical that my site is really enabling anyone in a meaningful way -- not at all that the goal is not of course a good and admirable thing but I don't feel like my site is opening any doors that twitch has shut. I'm definitely open to more info or context though 🙂,2020-11-16 13:35:17
jun85a,I'm doubtful bots are using this site in particular -- the twitch API has allowed this kind of access trivially for years and there are easier ways to consume the API get access to streams for chatting. I don't disagree that bots targeting small streamers sucks but I'm skeptical this site is what is allowing them to do it 🙂,2020-11-16 13:26:53

jun85a,"Not super difficult. A beginner might need to stare at some things like filtering with a lambda or f strings for a sec if they haven't seen them before but generally I wouldn't call it too complex, linguistically. I would say for anyone the hardest thing is keeping track of which loops we're in and what they're doing because I wrote this late at night with beer and star trek consuming a decent portion of my brain and my documentation isn't super hot 😉",2020-11-16 16:20:35
jun85a,"Yeah I did think about that but decided between a three minute TTL and the fact that there is almost never fewer than 1K streams (usually closer to 5k; https://nobody.live/stats) that it was low likelihood. After going viral yesterday I'm gonna see what steady user numbers look like to determine if a faster eviction or has-been-served flag would be beneficial.

At the end of the day, though, it's pretty low stakes if someone gets a stream with another person or two already in it (I suspect most of this is from Twitch users on the main site rather than mine, but that's just a hunch). I'd rather focus effort on getting a filtering system of some sort set up (by far the most asked for feature) and go from there 🙂",2020-11-16 20:40:20

hiy6ec,"Have I got the perfect tip for you? I discovered this tip when I was a young man I had just begun my cooking journey. My wife and I had just bought our first stove with five gas burners. This was top of the line clean looking I was bound and determined to cook something on it the first night. It needed to be something simple yet so delicious that it would be imprinted on my young family's mind and bring warm memories to the forefront when reminiscing. 

I made a keto coffee and took it to my back porch to ponder on the perfect dish to produce. As I sat in my oversized chair, I remember the beads of dew damping my shorts and the way the fresh air felt on my skin. It was a stark contrast when I took that first draw of now steaming coffee. Nothing beats that first satisfying sip of good coffee; you know what I mean? About this time, my daughter had come downstairs to greet me for the day. Now, this was indeed my favorite part of the day. Seeing their faces first thing in the morning helped put everything in perspective. Taking another sip of coffee, I looked to my daughter and asked, ""what would you like to eat?"" She stared at me with a bit of sleep still in her eyes and said, ""I dont know dad just order Mcdonalds or something."" Chuckling at her, I plastered a friendly smile on my face, which faded to my most stern expression as I looked her dead in the eyes and said, "" I will make pancakes."" She shrugged and said whatever that's fine and turned her attention to her iPad.

It was time to go to the family cookbook and get the ancient pancake recipe that someone copied off of a Bisquick box and handed it down over the years from grandmother to my mother and now to me. This was it the ultimate dish that put some excitement on my daughter's face. Little did anyone one there was a family secret added to the original plagiarized recipe. But im willing to let my family secret go in hopes that it will bring immense love and joy to your family. 

I begin to produce the pancakes by taking a skillet out and placing it on the medium size burner. I turn the heat to the maximum for a few moments. As the pan is warming, I pull the butter from the refrigerator with care. Then I begin to combine all of the ingredients in a medium-size mixing bowl. Turning my attention to the burner, I adjust the flame temperature to low and drop a pad of butter in the center of the pan. The sound of the sizzling and smell of the sizzling butter brings a warm smile to my face as childhood memories of the first bite of these very same pancakes come flooding back. Everyone is going to love these, and it will be a beautiful day y'all. 

Wow, I think that enough reminiscing let me finally share this secret recipe that you Googled for.

1 tsp salt (the secret twist)

2  cups Original Bisquick™ mix 

1 cup milk 

2  eggs 



LPT: Just search for ""salt"" to bypass the life story blog post before the actual recipe...and no, I dont really make pancakes by adding salt to Bisquick mix.",2020-07-01 01:53:23

They contradict themselves over and over. Your response would be, “well we’re all still learning about this virus”. Very predictable response.

5ihdew,"Played with this for a while, have some suggestions for you that you could implement very quickly and easily.

* You should make row 1 a slightly darker background color to better clarify those rows are used only for the legend and data type. As it is if you do something like the table below, you end up with only 2 states colored, a legend that says **50** with data of 205, 30, and No Data. I know row 1 needs to be row 1 for interoperability but just making the background a bit darker would make it more obvious it needs to contain specifiers.

 ID| Values
--------|--
New York | 50
Colorado | 205
California | 30

* Highlight erroneous, duplicate, and unrecognized data in the spreadsheet. Currently if you have two or more rows that say 'Colorado' weird errors get introduced into the map and legend. Also, in a large data set unrecognized place names among many good ones very easily would go unnoticed or be hard to find at all. Entering letters into the data area produces strange effects. 

*  I feel like there should be a way to pause the map generation so that you can type data in to the spreadsheet area one at a time without it constantly reloading. Something as simple as a ▶️⏸ button above the spreadsheet. 

* Make links to Google Sheets that have the ID column prefilled with acceptable data - you could just use your existing examples. Excel templates might be good too.
 
Less simple suggestions:

* Maybe make a drop down below the color selection area for a few customization options like Border display, map labels, legend position.

* Being able to change the coloration method would be good for data where orders of magnitude differences are common. Simply being able to select linear, exponential or logarithmic stepping would be more than enough and probably easy to implement. The same method could be applied to the legend display.

* Finally, maybe in the future it would be cool to support additional columns of values and use those columns to produce an animated map over time. Ie:


State | Population 2016 | 2014 | 2012
-----|---------------|----|----
Colorado | 10 | 9 | 5
Texas | 15 | 14 | 12
California | 21 | 23 | 19

* That would be a very simple way to make animated maps for the user and for you to implement in code since you would only need to run your existing generator for each pair of ID and Value column, and combine the images.

Oh man sorry I got carried away, but I think you've really got something very cool here! ",2016-12-15 21:53:18

118y19p,"Hey Everyone

Thanks for all your comments. I just wanted to give a quick update to say that I have updated the map based on feedback I've been getting.

**California & Massachusetts:** I have amended the map to show the equivalent 'cage free' egg SKU in these states, due to local laws prohibiting the sale of caged eggs. (California now looks much more in line with comments).

I also just want to clarify a couple of points on the map:  


* The map is focused on one single SKU (""12 Great Value Large White Eggs""). And the respective cage free version in CA and MA. It is **not** an average by area/between multiple SKUs/or for any other SKU.
* If you see a different price in store, it's possible that it differs to what Walmart show online. According to [Walmart.com](https://Walmart.com): *""Prices, terms, and availability may vary online, in stores, and in-app. Items ordered online may be available for pick up at store, shipping, or delivery. Some items may be available from Marketplace Sellers, who set their own prices, and are not eligible for price match. Items sold online by Walmart may be eligible for price match. See our Price Match Policy""*
* Or simply the data is outdated on the site (stores typically update every 24 hours on my code). You can see the numbers my code is also seeing by typing in your ZIP code on the walmart site, searching for ""eggs"" and finding the relevant product. If you still think something is wrong, please drop me a note!
* Finally, I'm looking into toggling to hide stores that show out of stock items. It's a bit of work but I am in the early stages.
* Thanks to everyone that pointed out the issues in CA particularly. I do find it strange that the 'caged' SKUs are listed on the walmart site for CA stores, even when toggled to show only in stock items 🤷🏻‍♂️. Lesson learnt 😅",2023-02-23 12:14:19

118y19p,"Wow. Very nice, thank you 😮",2023-02-22 20:05:36
118y19p,"Can you assume that though? There's very little grocery-wise with as volatile and variable a price as eggs right now. That's why there's a website tracking the cost of eggs at different stores 💡 

It costs (more than) $0.58/mile to drive, you'll be paying that sooner or later .

Even with that low estimate of $0.58/mile, driving 8.8 miles costs $5.10.

It's extremely unlikely that one Walmart is going to save you more than that over another Walmart 4.4 miles away.

If you have evidence that it will, then go for it. Or if you don't, and it makes you feel better to drive 9 extra miles in the hopes of maybe-maybe-not saving a dollar or two after factoring in the cost of driving and you don't mind **possibly** spending extra time out of your day to end up more in the hole, that's fine too.",2023-02-22 19:36:52
118y19p,I always get halfway done and delete my post 🤣,2023-02-22 17:14:28
118y19p,"Federal tax rate [underestimates the cost of running a car](https://i.imgur.com/gfvhMvs.jpg) by a lot.

A hybrid car, for example, averages $0.65/mile to drive.

Everyone has reasons why they think well established rules don't apply to them 🤷‍♂️

At best it means it costs you like $0.45 instead of $0.58, which still adds up quickly and you're not saving as much as you think. Surely you don't buy a new car (for example) every time you need to replace the tires?

Even if you do, tire tread is 100% part of the value of your car! You try to sell a car with bald tires the value of your car goes down $500 to $1,000 because the buyer knows they're going to have to buy new tires for it soon.

And if you trade in a new car every 3-4 years the math is even worse. 

You pay close to the same amount of depreciation you'd pay for 6-7 years but you pay it every 3 years! 

Also, the more miles you drive the less you get when you sell or turn it in. This isn't rocket science.

Again I said this earlier, this is one of the many ways in which being poor is expensive. If you have to make a 10 mile round trip to save $3 on a dozen eggs because otherwise you can't buy eggs, and the only thing you take into account is your fuel, you're going to end up poorer in the long run, but you have no choice because you have to eat today.",2023-02-22 23:55:42
118y19p,"> When did I say it was only because of inflation? 

Oh so by ""prices increasing was mainly due to inflation"" you meant mainly as in only 51% and yet declined to mention any other drivers making up the other 49%?

Makes sense to me 👍",2023-02-22 18:03:19

I've created this project as I always wanted to have a way to visualise all of what we collectively know as humans already. Mind maps are an amazing medium for that, interactive mind maps more-so.

Now not only do you see how everything connects on the grand scheme but you also are given a path with resources on how to learn any of the topics in the most efficient way. I hope to cover more and more topics in this way and improve the existing topics and connections so to not disinform the users in any way. 

Since it is a community project, anyone can give their hand in making this dream of visualising knowledge a reality. 💙",2017-05-10 01:48:48

Sorry to be blunt. I suspect you might have some latent depression/anxiety issues that you don't want to deal with, so you're attributing you dep/anx to your tinnitus. Look elsewhere in your life for things that aren't quite right, talk to your doctor about EVERYTHING.

I've had tinnitus for 20 years, slowly getting worse. Best advice is just to say ""fuck it, it's there, no going back now."" There are very expensive ways to cancel it out, but it's best to just ignore it unless you're rich.

lsdxia,">How do those places deal with income earned via cash that the govt wouldn't know about? Tips are a big part of a lot of people's income here unlike many other countries, but tipping isn't unheard of elsewhere, I'm curious.

Tips are supposed to be collected by your employer, who should apply the normal tax retention before handing the money to you. Same thing they do with the rest of your salary.

Although in reality, tips are a largely insignificant part of anybody's income here and I don't think anybody bothers to report them. I don't think the tax agency cares either.

>Same question for all other income sources that wouldn't get reported.

If you're in a niche case where you earn your real income through cash but it somehow isn't reported, you just add it to the online form.

However I struggle to think of a legal way to earn a significant amount in cash without it being reported at least quarterly, and I'm pretty sure that would raise a few alarms at the tax agency and they may come asking some questions.

Keep in mind every business/self-employed person is required to collect a 21% VAT on every sale, and prices should already be displayed to the customer including VAT. Then you need to report your VAT collection every 3 months (or monthly if the company is big enough), so you can deduct it from your income when filing your taxes.

If you're not doing any of that, you're likely already running an illegal business... and I don't think paying taxes is high on your priority list 😉

Also, cash payments above 2500€ are illegal here. Not sure about the US.

>Do they likewise not allow deductions for taxes paid to other jurisdictions (state/local) or charities that aren't reported to the national taxing authority? 

Both national and local taxes are already deducted automatically from your paycheck or any other transaction, and computed by the national tax agency. All the deductions that apply to you are either already there or can be added by ticking a box/filling a text field with the right amount.

Charities that are eligible for deductions already report your donations to the tax agency. But again, if something's missing (it happens), you can just add a line to the relevant page and enter the charity and the amount.

In general though, for like 90%+ of the population, filing taxes means:

1. Logging in to the national tax agency website.
2. Check the summary page of the draft, where it says how much they owe you or you owe them.
3. Clicking to confirm the draft.

When they owe me money, I typically receive it in my bank account in 2-4 days.

If you owe them money, they wait until the end of the deadline (June 30th I think) to charge you. That way your money can continue to work for you for as long as possible (e.g.: interest on your savings account).

The most I've ever had to do was adding a line specifying how much I paid to rent the place I lived in, in order to benefit from a local rent subsidy for young people. It was a kind of ""opt-in"" thing so they didn't add it by default. Can't ask for that anymore (I'm older and my salary is higher), so my taxes became simpler!",2021-02-26 12:15:35

n6sisg,"Chicago currently has an “Immersive Van Gogh Exhibit” where they’ve turned his paintings into projections set to music that are put onto all the walls and ceilings of a HUGE space (The Lighthouse) that is all white otherwise. I’ve always loved Van Gogh. That exhibit...made me cry like a baby. And this was my exact point. Through soooooo many years and then to be formatted digitally AND THEN to be projected onto walls...and you could STILL see every. Single. Brushstroke. I don’t care how fancy your equipment is, that conveys so much mastery and understanding that he possessed. I will forever be a fan girl now.

**Thank you for being part of internet history.**

Wow, after 16 years, the day has come. Today is the last day that Stumbleupon.com exists online, and as we head into this moment, we want to look back and thank you for making StumbleUpon an internet legend.

Before posts and tweets, before snaps and pins, StumbleUpon was there providing endless internet entertainment with just the push of a button. Because of users like you, we served up nearly 60 billion stumbles to over 40 million Stumblers, and infinite hours of “woah, cool” moments. StumbleUpon was more than just a button. People connected, made friends, found career inspiration, and even fell in love!

“I met some of my dearest friends on SU. People who I went on to meet in real life. people all around the world. more than just an Internet site. Much much more.”
— CH, stumbled 16 years

This isn’t “goodbye”; it’s more of a “see ya on the other side”. Recently, we’ve shifted our focus to build a new discovery platform with the lessons we learned from StumbleUpon.

Meet Mix! On Mix, you’ll be able to build shareable collections of your favorite finds across the internet: articles, videos, podcasts, and more. As you curate the web, your saves will turn into meaningful recommendations for others in Mix. We hope to make discovery a collective endeavor, helping each other find gems from the depths of the web that we wouldn’t have come across on our own. And you’ll be in good company with your fellow Stumblers that have already given Mix a try — see Tom and Art. Feeling nostalgic? Take a journey back in time with StumbleUpon Time Machine on Mix.

If you haven’t yet, we’re excited for you to try out Mix! Hope to see you on the other side.

ioqhxr,Thanks a lot for detail explanation 👍.  It does makes sense about base concept.,2020-09-09 10:58:00
ioqhxr,"Every position of Rubik's Cube™ can be solved in 26 quarter moves or less.
With about 29 CPU-years of idle computer time at the Ohio Supercomputing Center, two researchers have essentially solved every position of the Rubik's Cube™ in the quarter-turn metric, and shown that no position requires more than 26 moves.

What is the Quarter-Turn Metric?
In the early days of cube mathematics, two camps emerged on how to measure the difficulty of a position. West coast and Stanford mathematicians, free thinkers all, tended to prefer the half-turn metric, where any twist of any face, whether 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees counted as a single move. The east coast crowd, including MIT, tended to prefer the rigor of the quarter-turn metric, where a half-turn counted as two moves, since of course it could be accomplished by two consecutive quarter turns.
Indeed, the mathematics of the quarter-turn metric are very interesting. The positions of the cube can be separated by a concept called permutation parity into even and odd positions. Every quarter turn from an odd position yields and even position, and vice versa, so any move sequence in the quarter-turn metric ping-pongs between even and odd positions. This is not true of the half-turn metric. Simply by examining a position, without any search, one can determine whether the optimal sequence length of any position is even or odd.

Further interest comes from the nature of the antipodes in the two metrics. An antipode is a distance that is maximally far from solved, one that requires the maximum number of moves to solve. In the half-turn metric, with a God's Number of 20, we know there are hundreds of millions of such positions. Surprisingly, in the quarter-turn metric, only a single position (and its two rotations) is known that requires the maximum of 26 moves. Despite significant effort, no additional distance-26 positions have been found.

Even at distance 25, only two positions (and their rotations) are known to exist. At distance 24, perhaps 150,000 positions exist.",2020-09-08 12:42:54

That if you were open about your desires and she with hers your sex life would improve? That in a healthy relationship, you shouldn't feel the need to hide your sexual preferences/desires from your SO?  

I'm honestly so confused and slightly saddened by this attitude. It's 2018. Can we be a little more fucking open about sex/kinks   

Edit: Apparently none of you agree that men should be able to watch whatever porn they want and that their SOs don't get to complain or stop them. 🤷‍♀️ okay I guess. It's just interesting how I'm getting so much backlash for saying something that we all know is a double standard/sexism issue towards men. Wives/gfs don't get to stop their husbands from having desires other than them. If someone wants to watch porn, they should be allowed to without their SO acting as if it's cheating. It's not. It's self gratification; this isn't a religious police state so why is it okay for this to happen? Also, why are yall so damn angry that I'm saying this lmao. ",2018-06-28 23:22:09

2) If you get a captcha that contains any numbers, refresh.

3) Hope that you get a geoguess location with a street name or something to Google, otherwise refresh

4) solve the chess puzzle

5) update atomic symbols as needed (for example, if Bishop is used in the chess solution, subtract 4)

6) update numbers as needed (if the solution didn't have a 7 and instead had a 5 or whatever, add numbers to total 25)

7) Get ready to put out the fire (without erasing Paul (egg form))

8) Select all and bold. Start putting out fire

9) copy 3 worms to your clipboard

10) every 3 minutes, paste the worms

Hi,  
i was wondering which is the lowest digit count that was able to pass your game.  
Do you know how many people did solve it?  
Thank you for your game and your work.  
We did enjoy it.",2023-07-02 02:42:01
14kfxna,"After 4 nights, I finally beat the game! Then reliably beat it several subsequent night shifts with this method.

So as a definitive winner now, I can give my guide:

1 - Start with:
wordle🐛🐛🐛🐛🐛🐛🐛🐛🥚0XXXV25555HeFmRei am lovedmayshell1:0101🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗🌘🌑🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️youtu.be/#+

Notes for how to use this starter:

- Replace the daily wordle at the start
- 25555 is your 25-sum buffer
- HeFmRe is your periodic table buffer, being 2, 100, 75 (since V = 23 has to be in there)
- Adjust the time if you need, but 101 is the lowest sum prime number that will feasibly be your total character count, so aim for a time with low digits and ending in 1 to have 101. Or ending in 0 with 101 at the start, e.g. 1:2101 or 1010:00
- Use the 🏋️ buffer and moon emojis as your italicised + wingdings characters; you can italicise all the emojis from the start
- Use lower case letters for everything you can

2 - Reroll the captcha until there are no numbers whatsoever

3 - If you're truly stuck on the geoguesser, check the source code. The latitude and longitude are either side of ""!2d"" in the geo-wrapper embedded iframe data source link character string

4 - The chess move will almost always be a 2-move checkmate, so simply look for what will aggressively cause check (remembering x for taking and + for check) setting up for mate.

# Timed play starts here

5 - At this point with the starter, assuming you can balance the atomic numbers to sum 200, be prepared _before_ you bold your vowels, as there'll be no turning back from beginning to feed Paul the chicken
* You can use Ctrl+B/Ctrl+I for bold and italics even before the options appear 

6 - Once you do bold your letters, be prepared to put out fire immediately, and then remember to have up to 8 caterpillars maximum anywhere in the password box for Paul

7 - The YouTube video has a 2 second buffer either side of the requested time frame. So for, say, a 12 min 14 sec video, search ""12 minute timer"" in YouTube, set the filter to 4-20 min videos and then hit ""End"" a few times to get lots of results on screen. Then Ctrl+F ""12:1"" and middle click videos from 12:12 to 12:16 to open a few candidates in new tabs.
* Feed Paul.
* Immediately close any videos with capital C, D, L or M in the url. Choose whichever url has the lowest digit sum, or ideally no digits at all
* Feed Paul

8 - Generally Z and Q will be good letters to sacrifice, but obviously it depends on  your existing letters eg from wordle/chess/geoguesser.
Don't sacrifice A-F as you still have hex code to go.
* Feed Paul

9 - To find the hex code, inspect the source for the colour box and convert the rgb values into hex on another page
* Reroll the hex until you have no digits, if possible, remembering you'll need your current time
* Enter the hex code in all lower case
* Feed Paul

10 - (If you haven't already, italicise the 🏋️s and make them wingdings)

11 - I suggest for the letter sizes to go one letter at a time and just sequentially make each subsequent duplicate letter one size smaller, starting at 81 for the first duplicate
- Feed Paul

12 - Massage your 🏋️ buffer and caterpillars so that you have 101 characters with a few caterpillars, then wait for your time

13 - When your time comes, before you click the ""Yes"" button for ""Is this your final password?"", copy your whole password! Ideally copy it before you even reach that question and have it in a duplicate tab that keeps the formatting.

14 - Paste the password with formatting, and you've won!",2023-07-02 20:06:44

Tips:

* Keeping your total digits at 25 is hell in late game. Reroll your captcha and color hex until you get really low numbers.
* Place a bunch of filler characters before the fire starts, it'll be easier to manage.
* Don't overfeed Paul.
* Use generic emojis in italicized Wingdings as filler.

I can't give you a specific, as I just have an elementary understanding of sunscreens, but I believe that those used in the USA are no good, and  I'd read the snot out of why that's the case if that info was available on your site. 😁",2020-10-05 02:02:33

j50g3a,"Omg! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! I love, love, love your website! I use it A LOT. I actually use yours skincarisma and Skinbliss (which doesn't work half the time)... So my only suggestion would be to add a few more things to the list...
• Organic / All Natural Ingredients
• Fair Trade
• Hypoallergenic
• Dermatologist Tested
• Opthalmologist Tested
• Phthalate Free
• Formaldehyde Free
• Then have a little section at the top that lists all positive ingredients, vitamins, minerals, etc. Then people can scroll down to get a more in-depth description of each of those ingredients.

I have yet to find a cosmetic analyzer with those things. Yours is great already but if you added those it would definitely put you above Skincarisma, which right now is your only competition, imo anyways. The other sites out there are just too complicated. Finally, pleaseeee make an app with the ability to scan barcodes! I would pay for it and I am sure everyone else would too. That would be sooooo AHH-MAZING! I swear I've been looking for one for months and it just doesn't exist... And code checker doesn't even come close because most the time they don't have any info available and I've just wasted my time.

Anyways, thanks again! Seriously, you rock!

y3ncbe,"I think this is a great idea and a cool demonstration for a scenario where every actor knows (and trusts!) every other actor.

I'd be wary to opening it up on the internet and using in its current form, as pretty much everyone is at risk here.

This holds for pretty much every filesharing platform which isn't p2p (drive, Dropbox, webmail etc) but when you use the service you're literally giving your files to ""some dude™️"".  
You don't know what happens to the files after you've uploaded them, if they're encrypted, actually deleted etc. Of course this is not a problem when sharing random harmless stuff but it's easy to slip up, especially if the service is hassle-free and easy to use.  
The service being open source is a step in the right direction but not enough if it's not being audited/guaranteed to actually run that same open source version.

On the other hand op is opening himself up to a reddit hug of death at best and endangering his students' files (and other user's) at worst. Not a lawyer but with GDPR being a thing (you said you're in Denmark so it affects you) it's better to err on the side of caution.

I don't wanna be a downer and maybe being too paranoid but better to be safe than sorry, especially if you're using this at your workplace.",2022-10-14 10:38:48

I think they should feel safe, but you should really have someone be neutral about the topic be supportive. not someone who is obviously an advocate for gay youth. but you keep derailing from my original comment though. the overall comment is that bad faith educators are part of what is wrong with youth today. not necessarily gay teachers or Democrat liberal teachers, but educators who make an effort make ideological shifts towards their perspective part of THEIR agenda.

From my understanding, the books were basically part of the original plan and the web community existed mainly for people to mail their stuff in and network/promote, etc. The project started in the early or mid 2000's and they released the book December that year aka after they had gotten the content mailed in and then edited/designed the product.

It's not as if you could go on the site and have the whole experience of the books which were the hard monetization, particularly in the early stages.

However as anyone whos met ol' zipper cock will tell ya, he's too pissed on ye rum and fiddlin the pickle 🥒 (his, yours,yo daddys, all the baby making meat sticks, to the tiniest of chodes, there ain't a knob he won't slob ) to be allowed to touch sharp shit but the cooch corker of infamy does have some sick blow ups.

yva5y9,"Sign languages have a history about as long as spoken languages, but are not recorded as well. They have their own grammar and are subject to the same linguistic drift as spoken languages.

For example, there are different ""accents"", e.g. in BSL (which I'm learning) someone in London will sign some things differently to someone in Cardiff or Edinburgh and maybe even Manchester/Newcastle/etc. I know at least three ways to sign ""ten"" in BSL and I'm sure there are more!

Different sign languages have different ""roots"" as well. For example, ASL is based on LSF (French sign language) rather than BSL. You can read a bit more about that at https://www.accreditedlanguage.com/interpreting/types-of-sign-language-and-their-development/ I find it fascinating to dig into the history and evolution of languages 🙂",2022-11-15 00:36:43

yva5y9,"Yeah I get this 😉

Why hasn't an international standard been created is my ponder.

The sign for hello in English, could be the same for hola in Spanish, Bom Dia in Portuguese, bonjour in french, zdravo in Croatian, hallo in German, привіт in Ukranian and just simple hello in ASL.

But it's not.  It's such a wasted opportunity to create a universal language that does not require multiple studies to allow the whole planet to communicate.  Same sign for same meaning/word regardless of natively spoken language.

We could all communicate with everyone everywhere if this happened.

Mathematics is a universal language.  So are.comouter languages.  And musical theory   Why not a visual language the whole world can understand?

We've had this with flag signals on ships for centuries.  But the language is limited.  We typically use combinations of 1, 2 or 3 flags to signal a message or intent. But this has largely fallen out of practice outside military naval traditions due to the use of VHF and SSB radios relying in spoken word and knowing a language.

Just seems like a dumb waste of an obvious opportunity.",2022-11-15 22:24:09

But then of course unless the SunflowerT83^™  is competitive with the price of a human landscaper, no one is going to buy one. 



Im not saying that landscaping is easy. But it does involve a bunch of set variables. Terrain, soil type, naturally occurring flora, etc. All of those things can be programmed. Once the machine has the vision capable of distinguishing all of these different things , and the dexterity to plant them, dig up soil, grade, etc etc, AND it is relatively cheap compared to a human, at that time it becomes competitive with you.




It might not be able to DESIGN a pretty landscape, but after a couple years of machine learning, Im sure that a program in the cloud could do that too.

To play, just click on a country and use your surroundings to guess your location! ❓

yrr20p,"Hi Redditors,  

I'm super excited to introduce you to Listening!  I listen to a lot of podcasts & audiobooks. I never have time to read. I'd MUCH prefer to listen to articles too, in my spare time, instead of sitting in front of the screen and reading them.  

I wanted an app that would send the audio directly to my podcast player. That way, I'll actually remember to listen! I also wanted it to use state-of-the-art voices, so it actually sounds like a human.  

I decided to build the product I wish existed. I'm super excited for you guys to try it.   

Would love to hear what you think! Happy to answer any questions too ❤️ or hear if you have any feedback.

omtmeg,"Hey I'm Jem, and I made this with my friend Angie.

The Internet has so much great content that gets hidden from search engines, because ads and SEO spam take all the top places.

We wanted a way to search that wasn't full of ads and spam, and that didn't track us. And that let us see more of the content including images from websites.

Angie had the idea that search results should be more like an Instagram feed, or like Pinterest, and that you should be able to control how you view results.

So we made [lazyweb.ai](https://lazyweb.ai).

It shows search results in a visual feed like Instagram (which you can change), and when there is article content, you can click View Reader and see the page without any ads or clutter.

We think it's a fun project that makes it easier to find and see beautiful content online, so we wanted to share it with the community here, and see what people think.

It uses a simple chat interface, so you can just ask it questions like you would a smart friend.

Peace and love,

Angie and Jem

\[\*\*\* Follow up: 

WOW thank you everyone here for the incredible feedback, support and encouragement. 

We have just been blown away by the response. 

We're working through everyone's questions and will try to answer them as best we can, and there are so many great ideas here to keep it improving. We really deeply appreciate everyone trying out LazyWeb and supporting our little project. As a little team, it absolutely means the world to us to see this sort of support. 

The Internet needs something better than today's big tech monopolies, and we're going to work as hard as we can to give people an alternative that puts people first and reimagines what search can be! 😇🙏\]",2021-07-18 16:25:41

omtmeg,"I like it, few immediate thoughts are to increase the vertical padding of the text input as right now it's quite smol for the primary user action. Also the dark theme might be too monotonous. Even if simple/flat is what you're going for, the top left popup menu doesn't have enough differentiation with the main content and the border is barely visible/nonexistent. You could try making objects which are ""closer"" to the user have a brighter shade (see material design dark mode color spec for tips)

The ""what are you looking for"" card/container's border seems to have a bit of trouble rendering especially around the corners (mobile). Also I noticed you opted for no margins here but with margins everywhere else (border instead), could be fine but still a noticeable inconsistency

Also your disable commissions button and the like are a bit wacky. Touch area big on left side and none on right, can see when tap to hold.

Obviously you guys are spread thin so just trying to help by spotting quick fixes with fresh eyes 👍",2021-07-19 07:15:09

omtmeg,"Hey sorry to be slow answering. Still catching up with comments and all the great feedback we've had! 😂

So, we're still working on the NLP for this, and we've had lots of requests. We haven't figured out negatives yet in a way that works reliably, especially with fallback web searches (Bing, Google etc), but because of how lazyweb works you can shape results towards what you want a little. 

Sometimes using explicit operators help to shape the results eg:

\~e jaguar +animal

This will shape the results towards pages that have animal in them, which looks to get rid of the car for the most part. So it's like a positive reinforcement.

Using -{term} currently sometimes works, but not very well. 

But the aim is to say ""I want information about jaguars but nothing about cars"", and we have a ways to go :)

Thanks again for the great feedback and comment too! :)",2021-07-23 16:33:07

omtmeg,"Where they come from is going to depend a little bit on the actual search query, but if we can detect for sure it's an NSFW intent then it doesn't filter the results. If LazyWeb is unsure the results might be moderated a bit. But we have a lot of work to do with training our models on good examples of the queries and results. If you could fill out a bug report on which search went wrong and tell us a little more about the type of results you'd to see that would be incredibly helpful!! Type /bug on Lazyweb and the form will pop up. 

Another thing that's useful is our ""go"" feature, which navigates direct to sites and can search within the results of a site! For example, ""go youtube cute pandas"", ""go amazon men's shoes"", ""go pornhub big titties""  😂",2021-07-19 15:30:47

nr1lyr,"We had 1 PC in whole (elementary) school during my sixth grade (used for accounting 😀).

In 7th grade we had a first chance for class of Informatics (1st generation with that possibility, it was optional). Of course I applied. We had a few (I think Apple II or something similar) computers and TV to connect them, but nobody had success making them work. So we used paper to learn programming.

I was born in 1980, that Informatics class was in 1993. No it was not sub-Saharan Africa, but Europe - Yugoslavia (at the time)

After 8 grades in elementary, I went to Math Gymnasium (not a gym full of mathematicians, but type of a school) with much better conditions and very good teachers, went on a few programming competitions with various success.

I work as a devops today.

P.S. There was a rumor that George Soros bought 12 PC's for our Gymnasium. Why? To annoy Milošević! I still don't know if there was any truth in that rumor.",2021-06-03 11:16:57

I wasted endless hours of my life debating and justifying myself back then. Of course, those people thought they were always right as well, instead of a hundred upvotes they were receiving a hundred ""likes"" on those posts.
  
Today, a different kind of cult has emerged, the *""you're not progressive or left until you believe everything I do""*. I hate to be blunt, but I don't subscribe to your cult of crazy either.

Nobody was trying to hack Sonys stuff because they allowed open source. As soon as they turned it off, teams went to work, and did so Incredibly fast because Sony is terrible at coding. 

The best part of that video is when they show how the got the keys to write for PS3.

Sony had a random number generator function, that always returned the same number. Which allowed them to use math to reverse the keys 🤣

t3emmc,">Mining for most coins exists because it's a method of handling currency creation while being decentralised.

Mining is a ""consensus mechanism,"" i.e. how everyone agrees on the state of the ledger. In this case, whichever blockchain is the longest is the correct one, no questions asked. The currency creation thing was an incentive to get it started and a ""fair"" way to initially distribute the currency, but you could as easily have started by giving all the currency to one guy and letting him give it or sell it to people. Nano's initial distribution was done by people solving Captcha puzzles as a ""fair"" way to distribute it.

There are other consensus models, and in Nano's case it's called ""Open Representative Voting"" (formerly known as delegated proof of stake, but renamed to disambiguate it from other consensus models). An account's voting weight is the same as its balance, and each account can vote or choose another account (node) to vote on its behalf. Nodes are just computers running the protocol and keeping the ledger. Not all accounts need to be nodes, most people just run wallets that sign transactions and send them to nodes to be processed. Since people holding the currency have a financial incentive to want the network healthy, they will ostensibly choose to delegate their votes to robust nodes and ensure a decentralized distribution of voting weight. (Otherwise, if the network were unhealthy, they would stand to lose buying power - hence the name delegated proof of stake.)

When nodes see a valid transaction (i.e. it's been properly signed, they have the funds, etc) they attach their votes of approval. When the transaction receives a quorum of the voting weight, it's considered finalized. If a node sees two conflicting transactions (the ""double spend"" attack) then they cast or recast their vote towards whichever version has the most voting weight already. This means that the network will always reach a decision one way or the other (""deterministic finality"").

Since most transactions are not double spend attempts, they will be confirmed in about the time it takes for information to propagate around the world, allowing Nano to be extremely ""fast."" The consensus model also has no wasteful energy process or fees, which is nice if you want a global currency.

In addition to the efficient consensus model, Nano also has an interesting ledger structure; rather than a single blockchain containing many transactions per block, each account creates their own chain, with one transaction being one block. To send money, you add a signed block saying you send money, and to receive money you add a signed block pointing to a block one someone else's chain where they sent you money. This data structure is known as a ""directed acyclic graph"" (DAG) in case you encounter the acronym at some point. The result is that each account's transactions can be processed asynchronously since they don't need to be included in one monolithic block chain that everyone agrees on. This helps the protocol be more scalable in the eventuality if global adoption where there are thousands of transactions happening every second.

So, overall you have what seems to be a nearly ideal decentralized currency that solves many of the problems with Bitcoin and which almost nobody knows about 😭

Kids have a near 0% chance of ever needing hospital care from covid, which is on-par with a vaccinated adult. So kids could develop natural immunity without really getting sick and if almost all adults are also vaccinated it would be extremely rare for someone to actually ever need hospital care from covid.

The second unfortunate aspect of typical remote work jobs on these kinds of sites is they're from US based companies who say they only accept US citizens. Fair, I guess but still frustrating.


One customer service role I'm looking at on this site says they prefer people +/- 2hrs of EST. So most of the US and South America and barely anywhere else then :(

6o02jh,"Thanks for the feedback! I see you've written two messages, that's commitment! Allow me to respond to your points indivudually

---
>  share the link in a message to messaging apps

I responded to this above, yeah, I will look into this :) 

---
> Add a [copy link] button next to the created link to save on the right click -> copy link location action that is currently required

I guess I will have to look into this. It's actually somewhat nontrivial to do this properly through JavaScript, but it's becoming a bit of a standard, so I will be adding this to my backlog.

---
> Allow branding on the pages that the shareable link directs to. Maybe via a ""pro"" paid-for option. This will encourage companies to use your site as they can add their branding to the page that displays the time etc.

This is a good suggestion that has been raised a couple of times now. I am torn between keeping the site very simple to use vs adding lots of features to the site. I will be adding an item to my backlog to develop this more.

---
> Maybe integrate a [Doodle](http://doodle.com/) style [feature](http://doodle.com/gimg/doodle-online-appointment-scheduling-calendar-view-after-date-selection.png), where people can click on a sharing link and then they can pick times when they are free (with all times viewed in their local time zone) and a table can be built up with each person who contributes to the scheduling calendar. This seems like it could be a really awesome feature for scheduling things internationally.

This kind of touches on the previous point of balancing complexity. A few people have raised issues around using the tool as a way to _schedule_ things internationally, which it was not designed for. So I think I will have to add an item to my backlog to really have a good think about how use-cases like this might be integrated.

2zd7us,"A **copypasta** is a piece of text that is frequently copied and pasted (hence the name) by people on the internet. They are a very interesting piece of ""internet culture"" because even though they might look incredibly stupid most successful copypastas reference several other copypastas and basically contain several levels of ""injokes"".

For example, consider the bag of doritos copypasta:

I’d wager most people just go to their cold reads and vote accordingly unfortunately. 

And in my experience of having my comments misconstrued on Reddit, as cathartic as it is to be snarky and passive aggressive when that happens, that has only garnered me even more downvotes to express my frustration in that way.

sumu28,"Hi there,

I am the founder and developer behind FlowCV.

Current income streams are exactly those that Hotarosu mentions below:) Additionally, if you want to create more than one resume that costs a one time fee.

My plan is to monetize by making the signature and website product subscription-based – first I need to make them a lot better though.

I am not doing this project solely for monetary purposes though but also to create something of value for the world, that users and myself are happy to use. So my plan is actually to keep resumes free forever. Also because the people, who might need it the most are those who can't afford to pay even just a few dollars..

I am a data privacy-conscious person myself and I treat any users like I would like to be treated myself.. that means – selling data or any other weird things are not gonna happen.  


Was actually wondering where the traffic is coming from since I don't run any analytics on my root domain atm😅",2022-02-18 08:12:51

r1pe20,"So I looked at this amazing website for about thirty minutes (thanks, OP!), and became very motivated to begin reading a set of three books I've had in my Kindle library for quite some time. They are *The Tomb of Tutankhamun, Volumes I - III*.

I'm only on the first volume, of course, which is Howard Carter's book written right after discovering the tomb, cracking the seals and going through a couple of doors, and going into the first room(s?) just a little ways (sorry if I'm being too technical, here 😅), before going further to where they'd know of the boy king was even buried there.

Thing is, this ebook isn't just a bad OCR job ... everything is formatted correctly,  pictures included, and the guy that put the ebooks together added a *lot* of annotations (which are very much appreciated by me).

I could barely drag myself away from Carter's story to post this comment. I encourage anyone wanting to know more about these subjects, especially King Tut, to consider looking for these books, or at least the first one. Cheers!",2021-11-25 12:29:04

onfxvc,"Well web fonts have become a thing since then, so the world is your lobster... 

Unless you work at my place, in which case Gill sans 😞

The reason Verdana was very widely used at the time, by the way, was because it shipped with most operating systems. There are various 'web safe fonts' that you can pretty much list a few of, and be pretty much guaranteed to hit one before falling back on the default sans serif, serif, etc. option. For sans, that was historically Arial, Verdana, Helvetica/Helvetica Neue... and then you just go 'fuck it, if you've got none of those I'll take whatever sans font you got...'",2021-07-19 22:25:13

You should take a look at Deezer! Something about YouTube music and Spotify and Apple services never did it for me either, but I've been using Deezer for like a week now and honestly I wish I had switched earlier. The sound quality is noticeably better than Google play music, Deezer uses FLAC for streaming and you get to download for offline listening and all that and all that good jazz. It's great, I was worried about finding a replacement music streaming service for listening to music and not something trying to shove ads down my throat or be a social network instead of a music player lol

Also I paid like four bucks for one month subscription to soundiiz.com and was able to transfer all of my playlists and albums and favorited library shit over to my Deezer account. Good shit",2020-10-30 21:28:44

jksqrb,"Incoming rant:

I only ever used Play Music for this, since it seemed to be the only native app I could use to play my music. All the while, it kept nagging me to subscribe to their online service every time I opened the app, so I eventually downloaded a couple of third party apps to play my music instead - but since most of my music library is on an Apple computer that refuses to recognize my Android phone, the easiest way to import music was by using the Google Play online library thing. An annoying hassle, but whatever.

Now this week when I try to open my music library, I find out that I can't access any of it. ""We're done with Play Music! Would you like to pay a recurring fee to subscribe to YT Music, and migrate your music library to there? No? Well we've taken the liberty of removing all of your songs from your phone! Yes, even the ones you specifically downloaded to local storage! No, it doesn't matter that this was all your personal music that you didn't even purchase through us, we removed it from your phone anyway! If you're not gonna pay for YT Music to get it all back with our super duper easy paid $ubscription option, I guess we'll just email you a link to a gigantic zip file of your music instead, to intentionally make it harder for a cheapskate like you. Don't forget to download it all within a couple of months, because we're just going to delete it all for good if you take too long! Seriously!"" 😁",2020-10-30 17:36:24

rgcnid,"Awesome!  A few things, and I'll start by saying I'm not a patent attorney or even well versed in the law.  In my industry, I do have to protect things I develop, so I do have some experience.  As far as I know, filing for a patent is not costly.  The cost is mostly in your legal consultant, and I do recommend you have one since they know the right way to word the claims.  After 5 years, the cost to maintain a patent does become very expensive.  The idea is that you should hopefully be making enough to cover the fees by that time.  One concern I have is that once you disclose it to the public, it can't be patented.  So the ""concept"" of what you are doing is already out there, and there's not much you can do there.  However, as you point out, the magic is in the back end, and if you think it's unique, you should probably look into protecting that IP.  (Intellectual property)  A lot of people seem excited about the idea.  I do wonder if YT might try to block your access or claim copyright if you are hosting the gifs you convert.  (Hopefully not, but you never know.) Either way, good luck to you!  👍",2021-12-15 23:00:02

zgc9xv,Would love a 'scroll only' button. Seemed like I messed up a few pixels by simply scrolling around the canvas 🙈,2022-12-09 14:02:03
zgc9xv,"For sure! I’ll write up a longer post when I get a chance, but the gist is…

- Each pixel gets persisted with various pieces of data. Obviously there’s the x,y coordinates, and also the color which is stored as a number from 0-15. Any pixel that’s never been touched isn’t stored at all. So the area that can be drawn on is effectively infinite, but the only thing we have to store is the areas people have actually drawn on.
- As pixels are drawn, they’re stored in two places. One is a document database that contains the current state of each pixel with some metadata. Each pixel that gets drawn also gets written to a 128x128px .png image file. These files are basically “tiles” that, when combined, form the canvas.
- Those .png files are served by a CDN and cached on servers around the globe. When you initially load the page, it loads a bunch of images without running any backend code. That allows the canvas to load super quickly no matter where you are in the world. The initial load is just client-side JavaScript and image files.
- The cached images can be slightly out of date, so once the images are loaded, the backend code kicks in and we reach out to the database to “catch up” the most recent pixels.

At work, we have 3 different Microsoft accounts that we use with the Volume License Service Center (where you download MS ISOs to install, and see the license keys you've bought) and each one has a different phone number or e-mail address for its 2-step authentication, and it asks me to go through the 2-step verification each time I use it. So I have to either bug my boss or dig through one of her e-mail accounts without asking.

Not only that, but the procedure to turn 2-step authentication on and off shows that it's off on our accounts. Since it's already off, I can't turn it off, I can only turn it on. Which I tried, and it didn't seem to change anything. Grrrrrr 😬",2015-08-27 20:31:40

It's not reasonable to expect everyone to know these things, but it is reasonable to ask that people do some basic reading on the general concerns that are out there (not in breathless security researcher skynet clickbait language) and at least try to make the best informed decision they can make with the knowledge they have.

>While I was having sex with my wife, she was saying that she is pregnant with my child, she is not pregnant with another man's child. And I am very confused because I never had other men's children. I never had a boy when I was younger. Why is this? This is my child and it has a male name… my son... And this is my daughter… My girl…My baby girl… And she says she knows the man we have a child with. I was so confused and I didn't know what was going on. I said to her, ""I don't understand…I am so confused…""

>You have to realise that this is a girl. She should not be having sex with another girl, should she? She has a very small penis, she is just a girl. She doesn't have any other penis… and she doesn't like sex and she would always say that. And she could have been attracted to this guy, but she wouldn't have slept with him because she is not into men. This girl may not have liked sex with other males

The student also claimed that his girlfriend received death threats after he reported her relationship to the school administration.

However, other students and officials from the school confirmed that the student who was reported to the police was a part of a school-organized event that included other students and was intended to celebrate the upcoming Hanukkah holiday.

A source from an organization known as the Jewish Alliance responded to the complaint via email, saying that Hanukkah in public school is not against the law. He asserted that, in fact, it is not uncommon for high school students to attend school events where the theme of some kind of celebration is a religious element.

Cancer isn't a virus. It's bad cell mutations that become a parasitic growth that begins to coopt your organs as their own.

Those mutations happen all the time. What triggers them is natural, them existing is natural, and the effects are natural.

You can't live in a bubble and avoid cancer. You can't eat only broccoli and avoid cancer. You can't exercise every day and avoid cancer.

Things that trigger more mutations, or alter your DNA can increase you risk, but non smokers get cancer all the time. Smokers die old without getting cancer all the time.

You are a great storyteller, on camera and in text.  I was sad about the fate of your first gander, the one in the pilgrim outfit.  

You’re doing a really great job and on the road to success. Heck, you are already succeeding, since you are doing what you enjoy and constantly improving and growing!  The rest is just gravy!",2021-01-07 16:35:00
lgtqz4,"Don’t fret! I’m 34yo, American-born with a pretty wide vocabulary, and I’ve never heard the term “initialism”. I’ve only ever heard them called “acronyms”. Tip: some words just aren’t worth banking, bc nobody uses them 99% of the time. Tho there is that 1% chance you’ll encounter it 34 years from now in a Reddit reply from someone arguing semantics. 😂

I’ve frequently helped my Filipino friend on his journey towards fluent English, and all I can say is god bless lol. I never realized just how many unintuitive exceptions and context-dependent alternate uses of words there are. I usually have to caveat everything with, “So in that case that’s correct, but can also be used like this…” 🙃",2023-09-15 06:36:45

nrusnl,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid",2021-06-04 12:10:48

After reading some comments, I wonder if you’d get higher accuracy by first asking what they are looking for and having them select from a larger predetermined list. And/Or ask to select the items they don’t care about at all. Then, run the test as you have it with the respective items used or eliminated. This could eliminate irrelevant data points. For example, if someone doesn’t care about restaurants being local at all then that data being replaced with something more relevant that this person would have indicated like school quality, grocery options, etc you might be able to get a higher rate of accuracy 🤔",2022-03-31 06:23:44

rd60f4,"Hi!  Tour guide in NOLA here.

We 100% all have to take a history test at city hall and have to pass an FBI background check to get our license.  I’ve read only local history books for the last year to be able to answer legit questions if asked…
Some of the tours are worse than others, like anything else entertainment based.  

I run haunted tours/pub crawls and we do specify that our stories are local legends, but that’s what people pay us for.  They *don’t want* dates or architecture lessons, they want to get drunk and have an entertainer tell them stories.  My worst reviews are when I was more historically accurate, because a lot of people find that excruciatingly boring and are just out looking to do something as a group.  If they wanted accuracy they would go to a museum or go on historical tours marketed as historical tours… we don’t advertise as such.

I would also argue that there is absolutely a historical value to local stories that have been passed down generations, which are part of the culture here (and the culture is what brings in tourists.) Spoken history and tall tales have been a critical part of human history since we decided that specific grunts mean things.

Ultimately, it is a service industry and we have to keep our customers happy.  We are not “scam artists” for that, we’re providing entertainment as a service- and honestly it’s hard to make ghost stories like the Sultan’s Palace accurate, when they obviously never happened.

However- I will say that the most “scammy” of our tour guides here is [Bloody Mary](https://www.bloodymarystours.com), a white lady who calls herself the “Voodoo Queen of New Orleans.” 😬 She will charge you $200/person to sit in an abandoned house with a radio and “ghost hunt.”",2021-12-10 22:49:33
