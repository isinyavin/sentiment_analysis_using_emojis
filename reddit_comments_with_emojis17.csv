jptqj9,"I've never felt such of mixture of relief, happiness, and mental exhaustion. It's like the loosening of a death grip for survival because you made it to safety.

I was asked by a stranger today why I chose Biden over Trump. I told them ""His integrity, he's a relatable veteran, understands loss, his intentions, he's progressive, compassionate, and truly wants better for us. These last 4 yrs were treated like something to be won. As a nation it was as if we were in an abusive relationship. We were alienated from the rest of the world, our leader gaslighted it's citizens, incited riots, and killed thousands of people due to blatant neglect."" That's why he got my vote. 

I don't know anyone who supports Trump that their reasons aren't filled with treason, racism, or narcissistic undertones. You can't trust someone like that.🤷‍♀️ 


Update: This is my first silver! Thank you kindly! Im glad what I felt resonated with you as well. Be well!",2020-11-08 05:53:45

My parents are hardcore Trump fans and have been glued to FOX news for 2 years now, laughing over every insult Trump makes and I would rarely ever find them off the news. They have avoided it almost entirely for the past 3 days. 
I would like to celebrate Biden's election but I can't do much because of my location.

I fear Biden only made it on the basis that alot of people hated Trump and I hope he is more progressive for HUMAN causes than Trump was.

jqfm3b,"It gets a little easier. I know it sounds callous to say that, my grandma raised me and was/is my best friend in the world. Truly believe I will never experience knowing someone like her ever again. She was a saint. The first few years were terrible. And she passed on my sister’s birthday, so that was a nightmare — but then it helped. We knew she’d rather us celebrate my sister and quietly remember her than spend every year absolutely miserable. All she ever wanted was for us to be happy and safe and okay, and I think we (my family) keep going just to honor that. It gets a little easier. I still wave and blow a kiss when I pass the place she lived (usually a few times a week) and while she’s buried 8 hours away from me, I got to visit her last summer and it helped, as brutal as it was. 

It does get better. I think. There’s no timeline for grieving and it does come back in waves, but now I want to *live for her* rather than...”expire” because I am so distraught over her loss. I hope that makes sense. I hope your experience gets easier. It always hurts, but the fond memories are something no one can ever take from you.

Edit: when it hurts really bad, some days, I remind myself that she would be sooooo disappointed to see me in whatever great beyond she has found peace in — she was very catholic, I am not, but I believe she is in a better, beautiful place, and I know she wouldn’t want me there with her. Not yet, at least. I’ve got more living to do, unfortunately 🙄 
I look forward to seeing her one day, but I hope that time won’t come for a while. P.S. if you ever need to chat, I’m here. Clearly I love talking about my late grandmother, and I know the storm of pain and grief that comes with losing a grandparent. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need some support. I’ll try my best.

The people around me were shocked and stunned. I didn’t understand their emotion because I just didn’t have a connection with him. Some lead singer of Linkin Park died over the summer and a few interns were shocked at the death as well. Neither of these deaths made me feel anything. That’s why I want to take time to reflect and analyze why I felt so sad….yeah just sad that Stephen died.

As most kids, I found space incredibly fascinating. I recall spending entire days watching documentaries of space to the point where I got sick of hearing the same recycled lines over and over again—”We are all merely stardust.” Particularly, I found the magnitude of space, stars, planets, and galaxies thrilling to ponder. It’s mysterious and alluring to think about the scale of just our sun compared to earth. It’s also beautiful and captivating to see pictures of galaxies formed of an incredibly amazing number of stars and planets and a crazy amount of empty space. 

I recall just a few days ago looking up at the stars on my way home from a tiring night at Gates CS building at around 01:00. I stood in the middle of campus just looking up at the stars and feeling—I suppose—wonder. It’s a common feeling to have while looking up, but this feeling of wanting to discover and learn was nourished by watching these documentaries, of which Stephen Hawking usually played an important part.

Feeling excited about space and watching those documentaries may have no connection to the type of person I am now, but I do think it is wonderful to consider how excited these documentaries made me towards scientific and technical subjects—even if they introduced concepts at an extremely high and digestible level. There was never a feeling of shame or hatred towards science and math because I thought people who “did science and math,” like Stephen Hawking, were simply cool! 

As I have never met Stephen and know not much more about his life than a viewer of The Theory of Everything, I don’t really understand why I have this feeling of sadness over his death. Though, sometimes it’s fine to not understand feelings and to allow feelings to simply occur for they deserve their time to be lived out. Rest in peace, Dr. Hawking. 😢 ",2018-03-14 04:52:14

Let alone the freaking sitting president still for a week or whatever, like him (or reaaaaaly don't like the idiot like plenty these days) shouting HOOORAH for large media platforms silencing  the president (again. Regardless. Like him or hate his orange guts), and having such a huge swath of people actively supporting that should terrify the ever loving fuck out of you.

“Trump declassified whole sets of materials in anticipation of leaving government that he thought the American public should have the right to read themselves,” Patel told Breitbart News in a phone interview.

lhyp8a,"Dutchie here. I can’t see the documentary as of yet because Hulu doesn’t stream here (I think) but I’ve been reading up on the subject. 

In the documentary there is a clip of a Dutch presenter asking her about her breasts. He was big in the 80s/90s/00s, seen as a very respectable man who was a good interviewer. He’s often mocked now because he’s pretty full of himself. Anyway, he defended himself in the media the other day. He says there was so much to do (in the States) about Britney’s alleged beast augmentation and apparently she had become annoyed by reporters asking her about it. So before the interview, he claims, they had agreed they would tap into the subject but only so she could say her piece about it. And to be fair, that is what happened; she says something along the lines of “I’m okay with it if it’s what people want to do but I personally haven’t”. You only see the “your breasts?” bit though in the documentary. Ivo Niehe (the presenter) said he never knew it would cause all this commotion two decades later. 

I was never a Britney fan though I know some of her songs (Oops I Did it Again, very relatable 😂). Turns out she’s only three weeks older than me. I do remember being so annoyed that so much emphasis was put on whether or not she was still a virgin. This is very much an American thing, let me tell you, the sacred virginity and the “losing” of it. Same thing with Adam Lambert when it turned out he is gay. So what if people are virgins or not or gay or straight or trans or whatever? Either you like their music or you don’t? 

I think that’s why she married and divorced that one guy within 48 hours, just to stop all that speculation. 

Anyway, I was wondering; has Justin Timberlake responded to all this? Or Kevin Federline? I don’t know much about him at all. Where’s he in all this?",2021-02-12 09:20:49

lhyp8a,"I was just thinking (probably naively) that maybe one of the attorneys that assisted Wilson and his family in getting away from Dr. Landy could be asked to weigh in and/or reach out to Britney's attorneys? Maybe a far reach but both situations have so many similarities and both take place in CA. 

Both were very young when they reached incredibly high levels of fame. Both had abusive fathers (to what specific degrees I'm not completely sure). Both seemed to be the ""cash cow"" and most talented in the family. Both have some degree of mental illness and personal struggles. Both have dealt with complicated custody situations and strained family relationships.

And most of all, both are very talented and gentle souls who deserve happiness, the ability to receive counsel, & the choice to what degree show business plays in their futures.

Apologies for the rant it's just been on my mind. Love & Mercy is an excellent film. Free Britney 💜

People who put their hands on each other to resolve disagreements are trash. 

He served his time, they reconciled, made songs together, and the only time he ever spoke about the situation was on his documentary where he gave details about the night and provided context of their relationship that has never been discussed before.

But fuck Chris Brown and not fuck her, right? 🤷🏾‍♂️

Verse 1:
There was a man, a President so bold,
But his secrets were worth more than gold.
He had an affair, with a lady in the know,
But to keep her quiet, he had to pay some dough.

Chorus:
Donald Trump, what did you do?

Falsifying business records, just to cover you.
Stormy Daniels, with whom you had a fling,
And to keep her quiet, you had to pay for everything.

Verse 2:
Then came the day, of the election fair,
But Trump lost, and he just couldn't bear.
He cried foul, and claimed it was a fraud,
But the truth was clear, he just didn't get the nod.

Chorus:
Donald Trump, what did you do?
Falsifying business records, just to cover you.

Stormy Daniels, with whom you had a fling,
And to keep her quiet, you had to pay for everything.

Verse 3:
And then he tried, to incite an insurrection,
To overturn the vote, in a moment of dejection.
But he failed, and now he pays the price,
For his crimes, he can't roll the dice.

Chorus:
Donald Trump, what did you do?
Falsifying business records, just to cover you.
Stormy Daniels, with whom you had a fling,
And to keep her quiet, you had to pay for everything.

Verse 4:
Twice impeached, and now indicted too,
Trump's legacy is nothing but a zoo.
He thought he could get away, with all his mushroom talks,
But now he's caught, and he must face the law.

Chorus:
Donald Trump, what did you do?
Falsifying business records, just to cover you.
Stormy Daniels, with whom you had a fling,
And to keep her quiet, you had to pay for everything.

Outro:
Donald Trump, you're a twice impeached loser,
And now you're indicted, you're just a user.
You thought you were above the law,
But now you're paying, for your every flaw.

th8999,"I agree on the discourse and was short term excited when the green new deal was first being discussed. As someone who had always voted republican/conservative, I was looking forward to seeing some real alternative ideas being offered, especially since the overall idea is so popular.

Instead we got claims of banning cows, hamburgers, ships and planes with trains being the alternative way to go to Hawaii.

I'm sure you've all seen versions of that on conservative news shows, but I actually had a person tell me all that one day while getting gas.

As someone who is sustainably minded, I actually read the GND for myself and knew those things for the lies they are and told the guy what it really said.

He asked me why they would say that if it wasn't true and all I could say was good question. Read it for yourself and ask them why they would do that. What's in it for them?

I hear constantly what they are against, but never what they have to offer as an alternative.

That's a long way to say that I agree 😄",2022-03-18 21:55:07

j0zqzu,"Recall that in 1992, Trump’s smaller holdings were carrying $9-billion (U.S.) in debt, including $900-million personally guaranteed by him.^[[1](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/trump-touts-soft-markets-in-cities-like-toronto/article17993211/)]

Deutsch Bank soon come to Trump’s rescue in financing the construction of Trump World Tower in New York City near the United Nations, and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, of which he would later sue Deutsch Bank over unpaid guarantees citing an Act of God .^[[2](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/business/05norris.html)]

Meanwhile, a group of apartment owners had taken control of the condominium board at his new glass tower across from the United Nations. Faced with accusations of financial impropriety and an affront to his authority, Trump turned to Michael D. Cohen, a former personal injury lawyer who helped run a taxi fleet. He had already purchased a number of Trump properties and had persuaded his parents, in-laws and a business partner to buy apartments at Trump World Tower.^[[3](https://nytimes.com/2017/07/02/us/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump.html)]

In 2008, Affliction, a premier fashion label for men, announced its partnership with Donald Trump. Michael Cohen, who’s official title at the time was *Executive Vice President & Special Counsel to Mr. Trump*, was named Chief Operating Officer for Affliction Entertainment.^[[4](http://sherdog.com/news/pressreleases/Michael-Cohen-Named-COO-of-Affliction-13158)]

Affliction and The Trump Organization presented their entry into the world of professional mixed-martial-arts (MMA) with its first event, ""Affliction Banned,"" which aired on July 19, 2008 at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. 

This event was headlined by Russian heavyweight Fedor ""The Last Emperor"" Emelianenko in association with M-1, against former 2-time UFC® heavyweight title-holder Tim ""The Maine-iac"" Sylvia (24-4).^[[5](https://gazeta.ru/sport/2012/08/kz_4722597.shtml)]

In 2011, Michael Cohen parlayed four Manhattan buildings for $11 million in 2011 and 2012 into cash sales totaling $32 million in 2014. The properties’ values, as estimated by New York County tax assessors, had shown little change. Cohen bought one of the buildings for $2 million and sold it for $10 million three years later.^[[6](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article181133596.html)]

In early 2011, Donald Trump, and Michael Cohen among others, were accused of exploiting campaign finance laws by “testing the waters” re: a 2012 presidential bid.^[[7](http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocsMUR/13044334657.pdf)] Recall that the 2012 election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney culminated one evening when Obama lambasted Romney for asserting that Russia was the single greatest geopolitical threat at the time.

>""When you were asked, what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said 'Russia.' Not Al-Qaeda; you said Russia,"" Obama charged. ""And, the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back, because, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.""^[[8](https://wwwcnn.com/2017/07/31/opinions/obama-romney-russia-opinion-drucker/index.html)]

This suit centered around the website [shouldtrumprun.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20110429020811/http://shouldtrumprun.com/)—created by Cohen the year prior—asking people if Trump should run for presidency, utilizing divisive rhetoric and stoking conspiracy theories, among them Credico’s birtherism spiel. The website also had a section for people to donate money by making monthly contributions. 

About a month prior, Roger Stone was interviewed by POLITICO, where he mused about the possibility of a social media-heavy Trump campaign^[[9](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/02/stone-donalds-cash-a-trump-card-050175)], and pointed out Trump was sitting on $2 billion in cash. 

Ultimately they were not found guilty of wrongdoing.

Meanwhile, Deutsch Bank began laundering money between the fall of 2011 and spring 2015.

With the help of American Tim Wiswell, then head of equities for Deutsche Bank in Moscow, and a fellow equity trader Dina Maksutova, Russian broker Igor Volkov was able to move about ten billion dollars out of Russia, some of which diverted through mirror trades belonging to Igor Putin, a cousin of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and to Arkady and Boris Rotenberg. The Rotenberg brothers own Russia’s largest construction company, S.G.M., and are old friends of Vladimir Putin. They are on the U.S. government’s list of sanctioned Russians, which was compiled in response to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.^[[10](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/deutsche-banks-10-billion-scandal)]

So it seems the mom of the victim said he was out for a jog. The two shooters apparently thinks he resembled a guy who had been doing break ins in the neighborhood. They (admittedly) tried to chase him down. They alleged the first shot was fired after the struggle, but it seems there may have been one just before (shot in the air?)

From my understanding though, it seems a third ‘accomplice’ released the video because he thought they were in the right. Anyone have any clue on why he thought that? 

What a shitty situation and this is why vigilante justice isn’t condoned. At best, they chased down and shot someone who may have been casing homes. At worst, they literally shot a guy who was just out for a run. In *either situation*, they’re murderers.

l9mry1," 

Can we get a good copypasta writeup?? A few points to hit. Here's my best shot.

1. Why are we fighting? TO TAKE OUR FRIKING TENDIES BACK FROM WALLSTREET AND SEND THOSE SAME GREEDY F@KS TO GOD D@MN UNEMPLOYMENT LINE.

My Millennial ass wasn't around to get fucked in the 1990s dot com bubble or the 2008 housing crash BUT I was around to be raised in a world where if you don't have some kind of technical skills (and often times even if you do) you have to work 2+ jobs to pay rent AKA PAY FOR THEIR FUCKING PROPERTY FOR THEM, where your only out is an extra 4+ years of specialized education in college which they have jacked the price of so fuking high by the time your done your financially crippled and ready to suck the d1ck of the first company that's willing to hire just to get out of the 40k+ hole you were trapped into, where if you FINALLY find a way to win the game they freeze the God damn market (except for the sell option so they can get out of the one loss they have ever experienced in 30+ years) they use every media outlet possible to push COMMODITIES WE NEVER FUCKING TALK ABOUT and now they have invaded our LAST FUCKING space from paid off news (what else can you call that silver shit) with shills looking to confuse and divide us out the wazoo.

2. what can you do? This is not financial advice!!!? 💎🙌 your GME to the grave. You got GME? put your phone down. Play some fucking COD, Watch a new Netflix series, do whatever it is you like to do. The hard part is over. You have what they need! Sit on your fucking hands and don't let them firing at us from all sides with FUD and misinformation win. THIS COULD BE OUR ONLY CHANCE TO SECURE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OURSELVES AND FUTURE GENERATIONS.

3. 10K+ IS NOT A MEME. I'll say it again, 10K+ IS NOT A MEME. Do you understand our fundamentals? The short is still well over 100% for GME and GME alone. Everything else is actual speculation. HEDGES HAVE TO BUY. They need GME like we need air. And we're not going to fkkng give it to them!

g94vfg,"Just wanted to say, thank you.  For being a nurse, for continuing to work during this time, and most of all, for continuing to care.

Emotional fatigue is real.  I experience it, from the patient end. It’s so tempting sometimes to want to throw my hands up, and stop doing all the things I’m supposed to do, to stay alive, because it’s just so damned hard, and never ending, and feels like it isn’t enough, to keep trying.

I imagine it’s a similar feeling, fighting the pandemic. I hope you have a good support system and are able to get some comfort from your family and coworkers.

Because emotional fatigue and “numbing out” is happening so often now, I try to let people know how much it means to me, to see someone who is still invested.  It gives me hope for myself, my family, the healthcare industry, and people in general.

Thank you for not switching off and shutting down. Thank you for caring and being invested.  

Please know that even though some patients may seem mean and ungrateful, it’s very very scary, to be sick and hospitalized.   We are not our best selves.  You sound like someone who already knows and understands this, but I want to say it anyway.

When I recover after a stay when I’m very sick, I often wish I had been less of a pain in the ass, and feel great gratitude that I wasn’t able to express at the time, to the nurses and doctors who treated me with kindness and concern, and helped me get the things I needed to be comfortable.  

There are many nurses I wish I could say, “thank you so much. You got me through a really hard time”, to, that probably don’t know I remember them and think of them. 

You may feel like a cog in the machinery sometimes, but you matter so very much.  The fact that you still care about other people in these frightening times, when you’re exposed to COVID 19 without PPE, and your colleagues are numb or staying home or terrified, and everyone is sick of washing and sanitizing things and ready to stop...

You’re a gem. An absolute gem.

Please keep being you.  Keep caring, even when it’s hard.  Keep telling people to be hygienic and being a role model with your actions. Keep being the awesome person that you are!

It’s a tough video to watch as it was to witness their grief in-person, especially since they’re an extremely tight-knight family.  But his brother wants their story to be heard and justice in any sort of way possible.

It truly looked like something i’ve never seen before, and i’ve been to many concerts but this fandom, the travis scott fandom is aggressive as hell. this is some demonic ass shit, it’s almost like they worship him. some fucking cult id say. the thing is everyone is there for him, only him, they don’t care about anyone else but him. he could have prevented it if HE spoke up, all those people in the crowd listen to what he says. “start a riot, let’s rage” blah blah blah, only makes them more aggressive, feeding into his music, drugged out, dehydrated. this doesn’t sit right with me at all, i can’t stop thinking about it. the stories , videos, seems so fucking demonic. the lack in security guards is so frightening especially at such a large festival, much appreciation to those that stayed and worked their ass off to keep everyone safe. 

when people gather at these shows, invading each others privacy for a few hours just to enjoy a couple songs from a well known artist, everyone should be able to have trust in each other. trust that this person won’t try to take my bag, or this person won’t push me, etc. these fans whom praise travis have gone way beyond the line of proper concert edict and manners. absolutely disgusting and disheartening. travis, ur apology was so sad and fake, pls get some help and focus on ur family. my prayers go out to all those families that lost a child or loved one. if anyone is going to a concert soon wear good shoes, small bags, stay hydrated (gum is good, don’t choke) proper clothing, hair up , bring a buddy if u can, and stay safe. do ur research on the artists’ concert atmosphere, if it’s too “rage” pls don’t try and mosh or get to the front unless you believe in urself to stay safe. i’ve been to concerts where i’ve been suffocated, dropped, stepped on and it’s not something that most can handle. pls stay safe guys i’m sending out some positive vibes ❤️",2021-11-08 07:56:34

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

t51gp3,"**He called out Putin for the apartment bombings 😳**

For those who don't know, when Putin first became prime minister he organized a false flag that killed over 300 Russians to justify military action against Chechnya by blaming chechen terrorists. Three apartment buildings were blown up killing hundreds, but soon after a fourth bomb was discovered by a block's residents, the bomb squad verified the explosive was chemically identical to the other three explosions, and residents and the police were congratulated for foiling an attempt... **Until 3 days later**, when the people who planted the bomb were discovered and arrested and **found out to be Russian secret service agents**, after which all talk about the foiled attempt became a sudden discussion about ""the successful training exercise"". There were no explosives in the basement, *just bags of flour... (that field-tested positive for military grade explosive)*

There's so much evidence tying Putin to the attack, you can drive straight line to him from the FSB agents that planted it, but in Russia it's forbidden to discuss and the people who lived in the apartment building refuse to talk about it in fear that ""they might actually blow us up next time.""",2022-03-02 15:16:07

Wrong. and there's 63 days of live video from all angles on woke.net for you to review. Or you could just look at Google maps and see block that contains the courthouse, the adjacent park and the entire rest of Portland that is not involved. The protest has been contained to the federal courthouse and the surrounding streets, businesses and lives are all operating normally and without harm with exception of issues stemming from the pandemic and the lasting stench and effects of the chemical weapons that blackwater has soaked the streets in night after night for their campaign footage. If anything that pristine Starbucks on the opposite corner has probably gotten more business than they would have during the pandemic from all the looky-loos.

But they made me go to school for 9 years, get 3000 hours of supervised experience, take 2 exams, and get a license. That license, my name, and my address are on a public website that anyone can go look at and make a report about me if I’m an asshole. If I’m an asshole too often, I lose my malpractice insurance, I’ll personally get fined thousands of dollars, and eventually lose my license.

One department has contacted back and said that they do reference checks and leaving not in good standing would be disqualifying, but I want to know why that isn't expressly stated.
 
The departments near me (and I'm assuming this is not unusual) require no less than honorable discharge from military; no felony conviction; no domestic violence conviction. But nothing about other law enforcement departments...my hope is that this can be changed. No one who was fired for disciplinary reasons should be allowed to be hired at another law enforcement agency and no one who is currently under investigation (but left on their own volition) should be hired unless the investigation cleared them of all wrong doing...it's such a ridiculously small step, but I'm feeling like it will still be an uphill battle 😔",2020-06-06 12:58:58

Medication can help ease it but you will never be cured. It eats away at you everyday and it becomes so painful that you just don't want to carry on anymore. Chester was a beautiful human being who suffered so much, the lyrics for the songs he created were filled with so much pain and he expressed it so beautifully. R.I.P you amazing man, your free from pain now dude 😥",2017-07-21 06:51:04

Not wanting to be attention seeking or any shit like that just sharing how I feel. Will be listening to LP all night and into tomorrow. ""Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed"", there are many 😓",2017-07-20 19:08:15
6oi3gu,"First time I've ever felt sad about somebody I don't even know dying. Spent some of the most difficult years of my life listening to Linkin Park. You could always feel his emotion, it always made me feel better about being emotional.

Rest in peace Chester. ❤️",2017-07-20 19:22:11
6oi3gu,"😔This is hard to take in. I was never a fan of Soundgarden much (no reason, just didn't really listen) and I remember people saying how badly Chris's death hit them. I was sad for him, but I didn't have a childhood filled with his music.

Linkin Park on the other hand, thats all I listened to in middle school and high school. I met Chester at Projekt Revolution some years back. Really friendly guy. 

Chris, arguably the best rock singer the world has known. 

Chester, arguably the best screamer singer. Thank you for everything. You made my teenage years pretty damn gnarly.

RIP both of you

6oi3gu,"I'm heartbroken.. like many of you guys on here, Linkin Park got me thru some dark times as a teenager and later on. I identified with a lot of their songs and that gave me hope, I didn't feel so alone. This sucks, I don't want to accept that it's real :( 

To those saying that this was a selfish act, in the midst of dark depression there's no logic just the all consuming feeling of worthlessness, feeling suffocated by these feelings of sadness to the point that suicide feels like the only way out. Speaking from experience, I don't wish this on anyone.

RIP Chester ❤️ ",2017-07-20 21:38:56

l1l116,"Jesus. People act like this is the end of the oil industry and the country. The oil industry isn’t going anywhere so shut up.  And as a person who works in construction, every job is temporary, so pretending that these are thousands of permanent jobs lost, again shut up. The trades adapt, people adapt, the people who do this work travel constantly from place to place, across the country and internationally. Refineries are always being upgraded and or rebuilt. And like some people are saying it will probably be built anyway.  And nobody seemed to mind the the way the farmers took a beating when all that was allowed on the railways was oil.  And let us not forget that the former Cheeto in chief should not have done that to begin with. The group of states it was going to run through couldn’t work it out then that should have been the end of it. Oh and the fact it screwing the indigenous tribes like we have since the country was colonized should have stopped it from the get. Just sayin. 🍻",2021-01-21 04:30:42

You do realize that on average moving oil through a heavily regulated pipe is better for the environment than moving the oil via train and truck, right?

Now instead of it flowing down south, we’re going to drive it down south. Congratulations environment saved.

Let’s not forget about the tens of thousands of jobs it would have created for Canadians and Americans during a time when an economic boost is needed. The pandemic hit a lot of us very hard.

It's ""Men shouldn't be the only ones who have to go to war"" which in turns begs the question ""why do we accept war in the first place""

There are some folks honestly trying to defend Blizzard because they're a company and the move they made was a wise business decision. To those people: Grow a fucking spine. Companies conducting immoral practices for their millionth, millionth dollar do not need your protection. Blizzard CLEARLY illustrated this point by silencing someone who's just trying to advocate for basic human rights.

Blizzard is not an ethical company. I'd argue for most businessed lacking a moral compass, but right now Blizzard has committed an egregious act that really highlights just how little people matter when compared to the dollar.

So, in the wake of all the above, some guy used Blizzard's platform to say a thing that would piss China off hard. Blizzard doesn't want to get the banhammer and miss out on all of that Chinese gamer $, so they came down hard citing one of the vaguest, most all encompassing rules i think it may be possible to write:

>2019 HEARTHSTONE® GRANDMASTERS OFFICIAL COMPETITION RULES v1.4   p.12, Section 6.1 (o)

>Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.

You nailed it!

But let me add a few other layer for you to consider. Those same aristocrats who manipulated poor whites into dying for them in the Civil War (or as they would have called it, the War of Northern Aggression…), used latent racial fears to scapegoat blacks for the social, & economic problems that arose during Reconstruction.

First, while the poor whites of the South may not have personally owned the plantations that benefited from slave labor. Many of them were employed by the institution of slavery. Either as slave traders, or as the overseers on those plantations. So they still made their livings by justifying the suffering of innocent human beings to themselves.

The Southern white aristocracy then promoted the myths that angry freed slaves would seek to exact revenge on those poor white overseers for their cruelty. And that the supposedly savage “N*****s” obviously wouldn’t be able to resist the temptation to rape their delicate, lil white flowers that were their daughters, wives, sisters, and mothers. Or perhaps that those white women would be unable to resist the allure of muscle bound Africans, with superior “endowment!”

This led to the rise of the KKK, and the segregation of the Jim Crow South. The thing about segregation is that it preserves the ignorance that allows such myths to persist. The longer it is allowed to continue, the more deeply entrenched the misconceptions become.

Bob Dylan’s song, [“Only a Pawn in Their Game,”](https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/only-pawn-their-game/) about the murder of the Civil Rights icon, Medgar Evers, illuminates how po’ white trash was still being manipulated by politicians with racism in the 1960s.

Ironically, it was Nixon, a California Republican, who adopted the GOP’s “Southern Strategy.” Nixon campaigned on “States’ Rights,” and “Law & Order,“ (coded language that served as dog whistles for racists) to win over Southern “Dixiecrats.”

Prior to 1968, the racist elements in the South saw Republicans as the “Party of Lincoln.” The President who had crushed their rebellion, and freed the slaves. This all changed after LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act, guaranteeing African Americans the full Rights of Citizens.

Skip ahead to the 1980s, when Ronald Wilson Reagan tried his very best to ignore the AIDS epidemic that was ravaging the Gay community. This was done to secure the votes of Jerry Falwell, Sr’s, Southern Baptist, “Moral Majority.” Falwell, & his bigoted followers saw AIDS as God’s punishment for homosexuality.

Now jump to present day, and we have an orange, bloated, bloviating Buffoon in the Whitehouse attempting to lay all the problems of ignorant Americans at the feet of “illegal immigrants,” or globalization.

“Mexicans” took their “jerbs!” (r/unexpectedSouthPark) Or maybe it was China… But China definitely sent the ‘rona virus here to kill the US economy! /SARCASTIC

Ignorance is a dangerous thing for a society. It makes it easy for the greedy, and corrupt to exploit the irrational fears of the uneducated. And we all know that Trump loves his uneducated voters!",2020-04-25 15:53:42

I work at a USED bookstore. USED!!! We do get some shipments of new stuff that we buy discounted and also get new titles if they're popular enough, rarely do we get a book that has released in the same week. The latest Hunger Games was one of a very select few titles I have ever seen is have on the day it released. I don't know what witchcraft we pulled to get that one. Also it was sold out long before end of day because we don't get many at a time.

The amount of customers who are absolutely dumbfounded and or rude when they ask about:

-An obscure book that no one's heard of (these customers are usually very condescending when I'm not familiar with it)

-A book that released literally that day 

-A super popular book that everyone wants right now (I don't understand why you don't have it, it's very popular right now!)

-An obscure book by a local author (read tiny self-published run that again no one has heard of)

-That one book they saw in this spot when they last were here a YEAR AGO

-Well, when are you going to get more?

I'm more than happy to look and see if we or anyone nearby may have what they are looking for and will go above and beyond if they treat me like a human being. We do get obscure titles that no one else may have, it's a benefit of being a used bookstore. 

But they don't ever grasp no matter how many times I explain to them that 99% of our product comes from what other customers sell to us. I can't tell the future, I don't know what's going to come in that door, if it's popular, that's a pretty good explanation why we don't have any, and yes, I will check the back, but it is a labyrinthine chaotic hall of wonders that doesn't easily give up it's secrets.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Comcast’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Comcast truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Comcast’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

I'm in rural Ohio, do I don't know what crime you're facing. I do know that 3 weeks ago, gun and ammo sales spiked to the second highest rate of sales since the days after the 9/11 attacks. (The only month beating March in gun sales since 9/11 was January 2013, Obama reelection and right after Sandy Hook) My local sporting goods store put a limit of 250 on total rounds of ammo allowed to purchase because people had literally been buying 1000s of rounds at a time. The NICS background check system was full to the point that it was taking over 2 hours to get a check done. Within a week, 85 hand guns sold. The rest likely didn't sell because there was no ammo left The manager refused a sale to one woman who bluntly asked for ""whatever will put the biggest hole in someone"". Am I upset that gun sales are temporarily interrupted right now?? Not one bit.

Plus, before returning to the U.S. from France ... I have to show proof of Covid Negative testing... taken 48 hours (or less) before departure.  This seems hugely chaotic.

I took my daughter to go visit her grandma and great grandpa before she started school.

plk2fq,"> 1500 a day is 537,500 a year. 650,000 Americans have already died. Hospitals are turning away ER and ICU patients because of being overwhelmed. People are going to die just because of that.

So if about 60% of the American population is fully vaccinated, then why are so many people still dying? Surely 60% is high enough to see results right?

Plus there other health epidemics that have been around for a while now and kill far more people than Covid do, like heart disease which kills about 800K annually. But yet the only thing liberals have to say about that is stuff like, “you’re beautiful just the way you are 🥰”

kulsf1,"(I Posted this as a reply but it works for most responses to those who lack understanding of the intricate nature of the “right to free speech”) So to put this is a way that the simplest of minds can understand I’ll state this: The issue isn’t freedom of speech, it’s the actions caused by the numerous amount of those who are using their app to incite violence and set up illegal group activities along with is lack of censorship when it comes to promoting extremism, racism, personal/genocidal threats, etc. Remember, we have freedom of speech but not freedom from the consequences gained from what’s said or caused by what’s said. Sadly, most people know the Titles of our rights but fail to understand the complexity of the laws, amendments, and stipulations that help to uphold those rights. Basically, most no one reads the fine print, so when things like this happen they’re surprised and angered that they were unaware that speech is a right that’s protected but slightly regulated in accordance to the constitution and bill of rights. No offense or disrespect! Just adding input. Have a great weekend! 😁 - Added after edit: If you cared about freedom of speech or simply freedom to run PRIVATE businesses and to conduct operations how they feel fit you’d understand that this is duly legal and ethical. The government has no say how a private business is to run/operate their platforms or services and can deny anyone their service if a legal liability is a large plausibility, such as the app Parler was. It’s hard to comprehend that these private businesses have rights just like any other small business you support in your home town but I digress. Just understand that government overreach is what you’re asking for when saying the “government” shouldn’t let this happen. It’s not their responsibility or duty to protect businesses that become legal liabilities or simply lack/lost support from other businesses. Peace be with you.",2021-01-10 23:54:08

72xfdb,"I also read Linda Lovelace's book and Hef didn't come out looking great in that either...in fact he wanted to watch Linda Lovelace have sex with a dog. If you know anything about Linda's story, she was horribly abused and forced into prostitution by her scum bag boyfriend. Deep Throat made millions and she made a few hundred dollars. Her boyfriend forced her to do a dog porno at gunpoint. And when they went to the mansion for a party after Deep Throat came out, her boyfriend told Hugh Hefner about how he could get a dog to have sex with her. I guess he was extremely eager and into it, so he brought them to a room where him and the boyfriend watched as they attempted to get the dog to have sex with Linda. At this point Linda had learned to scare the dog off in a subtle way, so that her boyfriend wouldn't beat her after. I don't know who provided the dog, but it was at the mansion and I doubt they brought a dog to his party. 😦

The other part that creeped me out about Hugh is that he wouldn't let the Holly, Kendra, and Bridget leave to see their families like ever. The families had to come there. I recall one of them saying they weren't allowed to leave for a family trip. And when they left the mansion they had to tell security where they were going and it was recorded. They also had curfews every day. I remember the girls had to do a trip to Vegas in one episode and I just remember them being really nervous about getting back on time. I think they were only gone for the day or 24 hours but they couldn't stay longer than that otherwise they would be kicked out or in trouble.

Anyway he was actually extremely knowledgeable about dieting and working out. 

In talking to the people which I've personally known there's almost always a religious component but more importantly very socially conservative views. Additionally, they see themselves as fighters in a ""cultural war"" where almost everything in their ideology has a politically charged policy to go with their bull shit logic. 

People I know who have for certain benefited from socialist policies and those led by Democrats yet they pick the wrong side to vote for and bitch about why things are getting done. Then they misattributed why it's not getting done while ignoring the facts that the politicians they voted for are the same ones who don't give a dick about their constituents. $600 Covid checks are the perfect example. 

I'm also tired of people in my city claiming that the mayor is not doing enough when in fact him and the county judge (Democrats) are being limited by the governor (Republican). 

It's exhausting to have these conversations with these people. Even when you think you've made ground they just go back into their holes and watch some more conspiracy videos. 

I don't know where I'm going with this but man... Some thing has got to change. How do you tell these people to calm down when they truly believe their way of life is under attack. I had a person tell me ""I want to be able to say I'm a proud woman!"" ... Who the fuck said you couldn't? In fact, if you force everyone into your definition of male and female you actually dilute your twisted view of what it is to be a female or male. 

I also spent way too long explaining to another person that ""your rights end where mine begin.""

They want a world in which only their ultra conservative views are viable and anybody who disagrees is an enemy. I don't see how what the rioters did is much different from claiming jihad on the US government.",2021-01-16 19:26:03

I was born in a military hospital to military parents (covered), went into the military myself and had free healthcare, then as a veteran I receive free healthcare and will continue to do so until I die. 

It is morally reprehensible to be the **ONLY** industrialized country ON EARTH that doesn’t provide healthcare for its citizens. 

Is the military/veterans healthcare system perfect? No. But it has always been there for me, saved my life more than once, and I have NEVER paid for it or any medicine/prescriptions or follow-up care.

qkdpnn,"The only way to survive the US healthcare system is to not use it. You’ll still have to pay thousands of tens of thousands a year for health insurance you never use.

If you are unfortunate enough to need to use it, you’re going to wait for hours and hours before you go back to a room, or worse to a bed in a hallway. The staff will listen to you describe your issues and are specially trained to pick up on certain buzzwords like “pain” so they can determine you are just a disgusting drug addict there to get high. If you’re lucky, after another 13 hours a physicians assistant will come in for 20 seconds but they aren’t there to help; they just did it so they can bill you separately because they aren’t actually with the hospital, they are with a physicians group and don’t take your insurance.

If you have a chronic illness that causes pain take this example and make it 100x worse.

I don’t know if it’s always been this way or if it’s recent thanks to the “War on Drugs ® ©™”, but these providers act like they are pulling from their personal stash any time pain medication

Well then that's when it started going down hill, they made us wait forever in the room then came in and said they needed to do a scan of his chest, then later a scan of his head, then another set of blood, then a sonagram.  I was furious because my ex doesn't speak English and I told them to please grab me from the waiting room when more tests needed to be done.

Before we left we had to meet with billing clerk, I told them how manipulative they were and that I didn't authorize any of those tests. That the doctor only told me they needed to check his blood. We left without signing nothing.

He wants what’s best for all of us, yet stupid politics have somehow drained our common sense.  People who couldn’t even get a passing grade on a 9th grade biology test are somehow smarter than someone who has spent his adult life studying infectious diseases.  

I used to think my life didn’t change much when a new president was elected- mostly the rhetoric swayed a bit to the left or to the right.  However, with Trump my life has changed, and not for the better.  We are divided (my own family splintered because of him) because Donald makes us pick a side.  Everything has become black or white - literally and figuratively.  Instead of a bit of kindness and compassion we have hate.  We need him voted out; out by a landslide.

ip61ij,"I'm gonna go ahead and give you the TLDR at the beginning since I know how much I'm gonna end up typing about all the stupid shit that went on.

**TLDR:** Armed home invaders broke into my apartment a handful of years ago and did exactly that. 




Now back to our regularly scheduled retelling of the most traumatic night of my life...


It seriously is a pro tip for home invaders and one they used way before this year. It happened to me and my fiance. After they broke the door in, restrained us at gun point, threatened our lives, then knocked me around and caused me some fun long-term disabilities, it made us weary of calling the police. The only reason we didn't go into a full on panic when the actual police got there was because we didn't have a fucking door anymore so we could plainly see them when they waltzed straight into our house while laughing. 

The way they treated us once they got there made things even worse. They blamed usand they were gaslighting us. They tried to tell us we live in a very safe and crime free neighborhood. About 15 minutes later one of them told us they arrested an entire house of ""gang bangers"" at the end of our street about a month ago. They said 99.9% of the time break-ins happen to drug dealers. And the home invaders *were* looking for a drug dealer. But it's because they broke into the wrong fucking place. They kept asking where the coke was. Everyone in our little corner of buildings knew exactly who the actual coke dealers were... I guess these guys got shitty information. 

The police then separated us into different rooms and then shut the door and interrogated us for a while. It was tons of fun after being scared for our lives and just wanting to be close to each other for comfort and safety. They didn't even wear gloves or bag up the duct tape we gave them that we were restrained with as evidence. They walked out of our apartment pinching it between 2 fingers. 

FYI... we never heard from those police officers again... Nothing ended up being solved.

I still have PTSD... any bang I hear reminds me of the door being broke down and it causes a panic attack. There are a lot of unexplained bang that you'll hear while living in apartments. 

Ps. Sorry if this story is all over the place. My mind still kinda spits stuff out in random order while retelling this story. It's probably trauma related. 🙄",2020-09-09 12:06:54

Phew..after that, the school had to call my mom and inform of her any situation before they were to EVER punish me for anything other than a basic time out..she also went down to the sheriffs station and yelled at her dad..ya know, the sheriff himself (such a small town, he and my dad went to high school together)

mjwo45,"So there's a legitimate reason. It's basically legal bullshit because nobody outside the industry knows the real reasoning, but it's still legitimate.

Windshield Glass is rated AS1, it's basically the clearest, highest quality soda-lime glass you can get. Most windshields in the top left and right will have an underlined mark that says AS⬇️1 or something like that, above that line is where is legal to ""build in"" a sun-blocking tint or windshield frit (the little black dots along the top edge of the windshield that get closer together until it's just solid black). Below that is as clear as possible to provide minimal interference with driver visibility. There will be no visible air pockets, no ripples in the glass, no roller marks or clamp markings, etc. Clear. This is maintained down to the resting position of the windshield wipers, where it's legal to tint or frit again. There's also a narrow band around the perimeter of the windshield where it's legal to do this, though it's rare to see it because the trim usually covers it up.

Front-row windows are required to be AS2, one step down. You might see some roller marks or minor waves in the glass, maybe a reaaallly tiny air bubble, etc (most auto glass manufacturers just use AS1 for this anyway because it simplifies the process and is actually cheaper in a lot of cases, but it's not _required_ to be AS1). This is still to maintain a standard for driver visibility for mirror and shoulder checking, but was deemed not as necessary as front visibility and as a concession to the automotive industry, where at the time it was way cheaper to manufacture glass to AS2 standards so they didn't want to have all glass be that near-perfect standard to save costs.

No other windows require a standard on glass. In reality most second-row and rear windshields still use at least AS2 or AS1 because again, economies of scale make that cheaper to do. But, because there's no legally-defined standard, nobody can make a law against tinting those - unlike with the tinting laws against tint on the front windows, which have a ""safety standard"".

Many of the witnesses spoke of the strict “rules” they had to follow in his presence: They couldn’t leave a room without his permission, even for food or the bathroom. Their communications were tightly controlled, isolating them from their friends and families. They had to wear baggy clothes, hiding their bodies from all but Kelly, who they were required to call “Daddy.”

>He was directly charged for crimes related to just six women — including Aaliyah, the late R&B singer Kelly married when she was 15

>""It is time to hold the defendant responsible for the pain that he inflicted on each of his victims: Aaliyah, Stephanie, Sonja, Jerhonda, Jane, and Faith,"" Assistant US Attorney Elizabeth Geddes said in her closing argument

>Kelly has been on trial in Brooklyn federal court on one count of racketeering and eight counts of violating the Mann Act, a federal law addressing sex trafficking

I was pressured by my family and guidance counsellor to attend a Christian University, where Chapel was held 3x a week.

However- his personality didn’t agree with a lot of America. That’s where the politician side needs to reestablish itself for the sake of the long term of the country. I’m hopeful and optimistic that Biden leans into the current challenges and is successful for the nation. No time for grudges or anger or tantrums from me. Time to get to work and get it done.

SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

WE LIKE THE STOCK

KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

The only time Wall Street stock brokers will stop is when they are **forced to serve time behind bars.** The real ones, not the ones for the rich. I forget the term for them off the top of my head.

Proof is the bank bailouts a decade ago when it came to investment banks selling CDO's/MBS's to customers. Saying 'look how much we have earned from these, and you can too'. At the same time they would short their positions. Allegedly in testimony they were ""hedging their bets"" in case the repackaged debts were bad...

Disagree or agree, idgaf. You arent going to change my mind and I don't feel bad for people who fail at running a business. It is what it is.

MUTATE VIRUSES LIKE CORONA, so I keep that in mind when I’m conversing with you numb skulls. Not exactly critical thinkers here 😂 you believe that Joe Biden, the person who personally doctored the Crime Bill which put thousands of black people in jail for petty drug crimes, is going to save you from the racism of Donald Trump, the man who brought us the lowest unemployment rate among African Americans since the 60s, and who pulled the most ethnic voters for a Republican in modern history. Must be cause he’s racist. That’s the only thing you guys cling onto when hating on Trump and it isn’t even remotely logical. That’s what happens when you value CNN’s opinions over factual reality. We live in a country where we are innocent until proven guilty, unless you’re the president of the United States being accused of ridiculous things by a low-IQ media conglomerate, then you’re guilty til proven innocent. That’s the logic of you fuckwads. So I keep that in mind when talking to you, and I try to use small words so that you will understand. But it doesn’t matter what I say or what you are able to understand, because it won’t change reality, and the events that are playing out right now are going to play out regardless of what you wish reality would be.",2021-01-15 04:08:18

7poiui,"Sounds like it'll be similar to how it works here in DC! No sales allowed, but there's a loophole that makes getting and giving weed possible while staying I-71 compliant. Basically, marijuana works on a ""donation"" basis. Local vendors sell random things like stickers, jewelry, cool homemade soaps, etc. for high prices. And then it's ""Your purchase comes with a free gift! Lucky you ;) Which free gift would you like today? We have flower, edibles, carts etc."" Vendors obviously have to be careful not to cross the line, but the system works pretty well. Everyone is decent and respectful of the donation/sale distinction. And, many vendors donate a portion of their received donations to local charities. It's a great community! But dispensaries and the benefits of collecting taxes would be nice 🙃",2018-01-11 21:48:18

ls7y1u,"It’s fucking ridiculous. And people really ate up and fell for his shit. People like my mom, who has literally never cared about politics before or paid attention to the news. She seriously could not tell you a thing about current events happening right now. Or ever in the history of forever. Besides whatever bullshit she reads on Facebook while crying about fake news I guess. The irony in that alone is too real. She never even voted until the last election. When she had just turned 50. First time voting in her life, for this scum bag, because “he tells it like it is.” Ok mom. Whatever you say. 

I tried to inform her so much over these last 4-5 years because I *am* into politics and pay attention to the news. I see what’s really going on and truly try to take both sides into account and sort out the bias, look at multiple sources, and accept the truth I find even if I am a little more left leaning and biased towards that myself. But of course she won’t listen to me or even consider a word I say when I simply tell her to do her own research and dig a little deeper than Facebook and Fox News. But no, doing simple research is too crazy and liberal of a notion. 🙄 facts are no fun when you can just live in ignorant bliss and listen to the garbage this man spews because it sounds good (which I never even understood that because it doesn’t sound good to me. It sounded like a bunch of bullshit right from the beginning before I even dove in that deep and before he even made much of an ass of himself). 

It should’ve ended right here at the whole not showing his taxes thing. All these times he said he’d show his taxes and never did...he was caught lying right from the beginning and even well before then. Idk how people turned such a blind eye to it and still voted for him. I can’t believe this orange low life inspired people to even be first time voters...idk how he got people so brain washed. Seriously the smartest idiot and conman ever is what I say. Smh. Just irritates me so damn much. I wish I could make people open their eyes. I want to shake my mom sometimes. I love her but god damn. Wake tf up.

The latest update from this rivalry has Oliver offering the city $55,000 if they name the sewage plant after him. He gave them a week to respond, adding “Don’t Danbury this up!”

It didn’t take long for Boughton to respond. He said he would be happy to name the sewage plant after him but under one condition: Oliver had to physically be in Danbury when they cut the ribbon for the sewage plant. He also showed off a port-o-potty which they also named after the host: “The John Oliver S\*\*\* House”.",2020-10-01 04:51:32

Don’t get me wrong, I like Biden for many reasons...but he won’t legalize marijuana, he won’t erase student debt, he won’t create a medicare for all program, he’ll cut social security...he won’t do all the things I want and need. He’ll play it safe and things will remain stagnant for another four years, minimum. I’ll vote for Biden, if it comes to it, but it’s a major loss to me and feels like a significant win to Bloomberg. He gets to keep the news, his billions, the corrupt political system that he’s already (mostly) admitted to BUYING. He won, in his own way. He spent a 👏NEXT👏TO 👏NOTHING equivalent amount of his wealth throwing socially-conscious candidates under and will make it all back in just capital interest within an insignificant amount of time.

Can't speak for the rest of the states but the mayor hasn't stopped for a month saying they don't have enough vaccine doses while continuing to change and add to the number of those who are eligible.

What should be the standard that police conduct a traffic stop?

What should be the standard for you if you're pulled over?

Neither side adhered to any standards here.  I'm not interested in who did what to who because both parties were in the wrong.  

If our society will ever come together there needs to be a strict standard for police conducting a stop and it needs to be followed.  There also needs to be a standard in which you conduct yourself when being stopped.  People don't trust cops, I get it...but what you fail to realize is that cops don't trust you either.

I sure as hell don't trust the police, but if/when I'm stopped, I comply because I don't want to get shot.  If it's an unlawful stop, fight that in court...don't argue with the cop, that's when bad choices get made.

Try it out.... comply with the officers request, and see if you still get shot.  If you do, I'll fight for your justice.  If you don't comply 🤷‍♂️, you're taking your own life in your own hands with someone you don't trust.",2021-04-11 01:00:51

There was literally no reason for the officer to be that aggressive. The guy was talking calmly. He had his hands up. He knew his rights. 

He was in a no win situation. If he put his hands down, they could think he was reaching for a weapon and he gets shot. He keeps his hands up, he could get shot just for pissing off an officer who isn't doing his job... He's trying to do the job of the court.

Cops do not uphold the law. The courts do. Cops send you to court. That's literally all the power they're supposed to have. They're just supposed to get you into court so that the judge can uphold the law.",2021-04-11 09:05:07

The shortwave broadcast's was where all the bat-shit crazy topics were covered before the Trumpet following made him more popular and he toned it down a lot. The websites have always been Paul Joseph Watson's conspiracy diary and AJ would be nothing more than a shortwave nut job without him.

Then, in 2016-15 I think it was, I saw him on the Libertarian debate stage as one of the kooky contestants; there with boot-head guy, old googly eyes, and the rest of the assorted menagerie. I had my popcorn 🍿😎 and was ready for a bunch of hilarious performances, and to be sure, most did NOT disappoint. The clown car came, cracked open and the clowns came spilling OUT.🤣😂 I was havin' a good ol' time - until!... one suave, articulate, intelligent, well-dressed speaker took the floor and I gasped... ""_OhmyGod, he did it!!!_"" right then and there I knew that man was a sociopath and a murderer. 

You can spot these Hannibal Lecter types. I respect them like predators of the jungle. You have to keep your distance and appreciate their natural beauty from afar. It's a sad end to see such a magnificent beast die in captivity. But then, I tell myself, it was probably for the best...

First Rapid, Point-of-Care and Near-Patient Molecular Test for  
Detection of Virus that Causes COVID-19 

SUNNYVALE, CALIF. — March 21, 2020 — Cepheid today announced it has received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2, a rapid molecular diagnostic test for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. The test has been designed to operate on any of Cepheid’s more than 23,000 automated GeneXpert® Systems worldwide, with a detection time of approximately 45 minutes. 

“Cepheid currently has nearly 5,000 GeneXpert® Systems in the US capable of point-of-care testing and for use in hospitals,” said Cepheid President Warren Kocmond. “Our automated systems do not require users to have specialty training to perform testing — they are capable of running 24/7, with many systems already doing so today.”

**The test will begin shipping next week.** For more information about Cepheid’s Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test, please visit www.cepheid.com/coronavirus.",2020-03-22 20:27:11

yqhdsa,"👀 ummm no it's not...laws are up to the interpretation of our juries. That's the whole point of a judicial system....to ensure laws aren't being used unfairly or unjustly.....but we aren't talking about **laws** anyayws. We are talking about **rights**. In the US rights aren't granted to us by **laws**. They are granted to us in the constitution. That's why **laws** can be deemed unconstitutional. If they infringe on our **rights**. Laws are created to ensure that others behavior doesn't **infringe** on those rights though. Because everyone has the right to life, we make killing people illegal. **Rights** are granted to us by the constitution, a document that is also very much up to interpretation. We take the words written and use their intent to grant rights by extension of the written word, because we cannot amend the constitution for every single right that we are guaranteed because it would be 1,000,000 pages long, and take up time and money from our legislative process. Up until now, we have operated based on this system because the process of formally amending the constitution is a time consuming process. However, we do have a system of checks and balances that allow us to codify rights by amending the constitution, but that is used when the legislative branch views that the SC court has undermined the interpretation of our rights granted by the constitution, and simply doesn't happen right now because the political system has been operating on good faith by both parties for a while up until recently.

Not every right needs to be spelt out, because some can be *interpreted* by the rights granted from others. For instance, our constitution says everyone has the right to keep and bare arms, but it doesn't say everyone has the right to keep ammunition. Since we know ammunition is needed for arms to be effectively used, we have, by extension, inferred that people have the right to keep ammunition as well. 

Rights established context for laws, laws establish context for behavior. Behavior is judged to see if the context of the laws apply to it, and the laws are analyzed to see if they violate our rights.",2022-11-09 20:54:47

A lot of the isolation helped teens and some older people really go within and start thinking about things they’d never thought. That’s why TikTok has been so huge for spiritual people, as well as social reform movements and stuff. Like, all the protests last year, the tv wasn’t ever showing what was going on. But watching peoples videos AS it was all happening, painted a picture the media would never show us. People standing in solidarity for a good cause they all believed in. 

Of course there WERE a lot of troublemakers mixed in, but you’ll find that everywhere. 

All of the people who were actually organizing people effectively and making the movement stay on pace with Peace, civility, and prioritizing action, were targeted early on and many haven’t been seen since, sadly. 

But at home, people were either complaining about “going back to normal”(whatever that actually means) and then the people who accepted it and really grew from the experience. 

I was very happy to stay at home, play games, spend time with my love and my pets, and most of all, spend time with MYSELF.

This coincided with that pus-gut Falwell and the religious right rising, Separation of Church & State be damned. has devolved into the present situation, it’s been so long since a republican (don’t get me wrong, there’s charlatans and incompetents on both sides of the aisle, and I don’t agree with the left’s concepts of ‘cancel culture’, but you don’t even need to even be competent anymore, and morons will vote for you if you’re a ‘R’, even if you helped child molesters conceal their crimes (Jim Jordan - even though they are supposed to be crusading AGAINST the perverted & cannaballistic democrats)…It wouldn’t matter if a candidate was the reincarnation of Gandhi, if he’s a ‘D’, he’s the devil. 

Part of me doesn’t even care anymore, since it’s hopeless.

Notice how you keep strawmanning. We're talking about the school district here. Not an elementary school. 

>Access to that parking lot is only allowed by person(s) permitted by the property owner.

Yes, access is granted to the general public. 😉

v3gj7j,"You cannot sit in a school district parking lot all day and not be cited for trespassing. That’s 100% false, unless by pure coincidence nobody notices you trespassing. 

No you got to gaslight! 🤣, I felt you knew you were wrong but that confirms it for me. There is no strawman, the school district office and an elementary school are both school property. There is no distinction legally between the two. You cannot go on either legally without the permission of the school board or it’s designee. 

No, the pubic isn’t granted access to school property. Only students, staff, or persons invite on school property are legally allowed. 

Anyone besides staff and students can be asked to leave at any time and can be arrested if they don’t leave, because they’re trespassing. Even parents don’t have a legal right to be on campus without school board permission, unless it’s to pick up to drop off their children.

The police asked them to leave, they are legally acting on the school boards behalf as a legal designee. FFS, you’re either a troll or you’re the dumbest MF on Reddit.

In the ultimate convergence of Y2K memes, I had taken off the cover of my ridiculously overclocked Celeron because it was running super hot and things were starting to warp and disconnect.  That thing beat the shit out of any Pentium at half the price.

I’m sure many opposed will bring up financial ramifications on the economy and all the other bullet points , but I was for 100% cancellation.   Those that we’re paying on loans and not spending money on other things if they had it all wiped clean, they would spending that money on other things.   Maybe they would be able to afford a house.   The first family vacation.     A new(er) car that might be desperately needed as their old one is high mileage and in bad shape.   More food, more clothes, more meals out to support small, local business.   The list goes on and on.   I would think that would TRUMP (see what I did there 🤣) any negative economic impact.   

At the end of the day, those opposed are also the same ones bitching how large corporations aren’t paying tax, or how after 2008, those same large companies were getting bailout loans from the government because of their greed.  

Bottom line, those that got this help may sleep better tonight.   Maybe they can look ahead to their future more compared to dreading the next phone call, letter from a collection company, etc.

wwmsy0,"Lmao American universities are a fucking scam. 

I did a year at college fully funded, 5 years for undergrad paid for, even with a year paid when I didn't complete for medical reasons and then a year's postgrad.

My current debt is £30k for 7 years of education and any payments I have made have been refunded (£600) since 2017. There is NO danger I am EVER paying that back. The Scottish government even increased the minimum earnings before you start paying pennies of it back a month. Your pension and tax contributions each month are higher.

The debt is forgiven at 20 years from my last loan in 2016 and that's with adding 1.5% interest. The loans are only for living costs considering all our courses are fully funded by the government. Being a student was the most financially stable I have ever been in my life and especially lucrative considering it's not means tested so you can work as much as you like, earning as much as you like while getting free money every month that paid your rent, textbooks, transport and beer money.

I don't think I know a single person who has ever paid their student loans off. They've always just been forgiven. It's a joke to get your annual summary of the debt because they top of it says ""THIS IS AN ANNUAL STATEMENT AND NOT A NOTICE OF REPAYMENT.""

We use the euphamism of loan for free, universal education so it doesn't upset the non Scots for having to pay higher course fees to attend a Scottish university. The East Asians are the ones who literally pay our education, considering they're charged £30k a year when we ""pay"" from £1700 a year 😂

l6gdz3,"It doesn’t matter if some of the buildings cause good things. Religion itself causes harm and any instances of it contribute to greater a harm. 

Women losing their rights, gay people bullied to suicide, hatred of minority religions, enforced conformity, child brides, the encouragement of irrational thinking (especially and for people with pre existing mental conditions), making kids feel guilty or responsible for bad things when they aren’t, rampant corruption, and the concealment of pedophilia are all just the issues with religion I could think of off the top of my head. 

People are suffering, and you can argue “b-but there is good!”, but it doesn’t change that. Burning down a city might kill a powerful mafia that lives within (a good thing) but it doesn’t outweigh the death and suffering and destruction. 

As long as the mafia can be taken down differently (and even if it can’t) nobody should recommend burning down a city. We should take it down without large destruction. 

And by this, I mean that ALL the benefits of religion can be found elsewhere. Many secular groups provide community, while Yoga and meditation can provide ‘spirituality’. Secular charities also exist and are (arguably) better. 

Now you might point out all the innocent believers, and I don’t hate the people, but their own innocence (or ignorance) doesn’t change the harm. 

Facts don’t care about your feelings. Sometimes when advancing society and building a better world, we have to cut out bad coping mechanisms. Religion is a coping method that has bad effects on the world and can be replaced. So we should sympathetically try to move people past it. Same as how we won’t let somebody steal or do drugs to cope with the hardships of life. 

Anyway, I respect your (probably?) religious beliefs and I don’t want this to come across as an attack, but I just wanted to try to explain many of our positions here on reddit. 

Some people may be “angry atheists” (I was one too) but many of us are simply passionate about what we believe will save actual lives. I do what I do in hopes of protecting children from what I had to go through (a gay kid in a southern evangelical family) I used to be angry at religion, but now I’m just passionate about truth and protecting others.

didaqf,"To preface, I come from a country that has somewhat recently committed an ongoing UN human rights violation against refugees (and the public generally supports it) and practiced genocide so don’t get it twisted that I’m excusing anything. 

I think people need to understand the century leading up to this moment that led to the China people talking like this - it’s not just government media brainwashing. They have a long history of death and tragedy and not just in the hands of Mao. They tried democracy which failed badly. There is a long path of death that led to the CCP and people under a communist style government also think very differently to us. They are one part of a whole (generally) and not just an individual in a big group. A lot of the people’s (NOT the CCP) anger about Taiwan and Hong Kong stems from their history of infighting and massacres. 

I really wish everyone had more knowledge about this because I personally think a lot of people are focusing on anger towards the people not the dictatorship, which is alienating many further from opening their minds. 

I support  🇭🇰 Hong Kong and 🇹🇼 Taiwan as their own people and government.",2019-10-16 01:29:03

The gift of life is something that should never be taken for granted and if the power of a vaccine is stopping you from appreciating the gift, I would say they aren’t all that deserving of it in the first place. 

Considering my family fought tooth and nail and went through literal hell so my brother can live a long healthy life, the dude who can’t even take a vaccine can honestly go fuck himself.

Hope all is well with your family and your son! I am very aware of the anxiety and hell the process is but I really hope everything is better for you guys now 🙏

Edit - Since people keep asking about the backwards heart thing 

* He had what is called L-transposition of the great arteries. Basically his heart formed the opposite of a normal heart. Still on left side of chest but his ventricles were switched. The right ventricle is on the left side but is weaker than the left ventricle because it doesn’t pump blood out to the body so it had to work harder. On top of that, the valves on both sides were malformed and leaked which put more pressure on the ventricle. He was also born with 2 large holes in his heart that were repaired at birth but the leaks worsened by 13 and his heart went into severe failure",2022-01-25 15:42:55

Let's put on a tin hat real quick, knowing pedophiles in jail are super likely to commit suicide and knowing the world is watching Jeffery Epstein HOW 👏 THE👏 FUCK 👏 do you not have him on suidice watch? How do you NOT have him flagged as a high risk or VIP that mandates a more watchful eye?
Before you start saying ""well they can't drop everything for all the pedophiles that want to kill themselves""
HE WAS ALL OVER THE NEWSSSS we aren't talking about some random teacher that diddled kids, we are talking about a guy who had a literally ALL THE DIRT on some of the HIGHEST RANKING and MOST ELITE people of the world...Im sorry, didn't El Chapo escape from prisons?

It's funny how the guy who so eloquently describes how farfetched it would be for someone to go into the jail to kill him AND in the same breath describe how faulty the system was ""cameras going out, guards asleep""

So which is it? Is the prison inept enough to let the most high profile criminal kill himself but apparently great enough for it to be impossible for anyone to kill him? Also who the fuck would send an assassin?? Like come on, there are CRIMINALS IN PRISON. Fucking pay off a guard, pay off a prisoner, and boom.




Again, I'm not at all saying he did or did not kill himself. Im saying that this guy who everyone is praising for his amazingly smart comment on how it ISNT a conspiracy completely condraticts himself by both saying it's impossible to kill him but that the prison is so shitty anything can happen including the sleeping guards, cameras off, and other things that were just o so convenient",2021-05-22 11:21:38

The reviewer finds it hard to view them as heroes, since their actions are not heroic in nature.

wme0xc,"Paying for lunches suck. We applied for reduced lunches for my daughter and got denied because it goes off of pretax income. Problem is pretax income is like 300 more dollars a week than take home because medical insurance, vision, and dental from the company come out and then it’s taxed. So filling it out pretax came out to like showing we made 47000$ which was too much for a family of three to even reduce lunch cost. But if you do it on actual take home pay, it’s 36000$ which qualifies for reduced income. If we minus out the insurance coming out it’s 41000$ which qualifies, but I don’t know if they’re going to understand that the insurance comes off before taxes based on the subs. Insurance is just pulled from the pay. Example: pre-tax pay 936 per week, take home pay 654 per week. 🪦 


Last year and the year before my daughter had free lunch because of Covid, she’s sped and is struggling to understand that she can’t just grab a tray because that’s what she’s being doing, she actually needs to eat all of it cause we can’t afford to sent lunch and have her pick up a tray which has become a habit for her. 😔",2022-08-12 18:24:09

ha694o,"All of what you said, yes. But also cops are not equipped to handle these types of situations so more often than not the victim will end up being something akin to interrogated for every detail of what happened when trauma does not work that way. Trauma is stored as flashes of events, happening all over time as opposed to a neat flowing storyline like happier memories. Because it's not easy to put together and cops have no depth not training to deal with people who have been through trauma, the victim is treated as a liar, attention seeker, etc. Who would want to go through that? Just to have to also tell a lawyer, judge, etc etc etc again and again for what? Most rapists who do go to court are nor convicted and if they are the punishment is not adequate.

It just seems wrong to me that the law says you can kill a baby a minute before birth, but not a minute after. To me that baby is exactly the same, except it’s not inside its mother and attached anymore. It feels way more like killing a baby than it does aborting a fetus at that point. 

But I’ll end that entire thing with I’m a guy, and although it seems wrong to me, these women’s health issues aren’t about me, so if the majority of women agree with this then I’d accept it. I’m certainly more in favour of this than what’s going on in Texas 😅",2022-04-05 02:28:05

e6fysa,"Fun numbers: residential water consumption accounts for less than 10% of all water use (and I’m being generous by saying 10%).  If all individuals reduce their consumption by 100% , essentially using no water, then we are still only accounting for 10% of the problem.  Let’s be more real here and say individual reduction is 50% or 25%.  That means the total overall impact is only saving 5% or 2.5% respectively.  Now taking the more accurate 6-8% residential consumption into account, those overall water savings percentages are even less.  Basically, no matter what all of society does on an individual level, it will never solve the water crisis.  

Corporations and businesses are not required to save water, yet use over 90% 🤯

▪Bayer found out that their medicine was contaminated with HIV, but they didn't want to lose profits by throwing it away. They sold it overseas and infected tens of thousands of people with HIV. [More info.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products)

▪Pretty much every other pharmaceutical or medical company.

▪Big tobacco companies lying about health risks.

▪3M and DuPont spreading deadly toxic chemicals through teflon and covering up all of the deaths from cancer related to teflon. [More info.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_We_Know)

▪Coca Cola bottlers in Colombia hiring guerrilla hitmen to murder union organizers who wanted better working conditions. [More info.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1448962.stm)

Truth is the Obama midterm is what ended all hope and got us here. I was able to first vote for Obama. Exciting to do. First ever election for me. Then midterms? 🤷‍♂️ I dunno anything bout that stuff too busy sorry, gonna go drink instead. Assholes like me fucked it up. Continue to Fuck it up.

Only reason McConnell made certain moves is because we have him that power, he actually fucks up all the time, he fillibusteted his OWN BILL. He had a slam dunk vote to repeal Obamacare and his OWN GOP PRES CANDIDATE straight gave him a thumbs down at the last second.

McConnell is just a shield for others in the GOP because his seat is untouchable due to it being a rural wasteland. He literally is a shit politician who just happens to be the face of the party that is in power for most of this nations history. On almost every level conservatives have always held power.

Now I'm wondering if I shouldn't just schedule to have my tubes tied in case my IUD ever fails since the abortion option might be stripped away from me.

>Ya'll.... me and my coworkers are literally being called death squads by our community members. It is a select group of people, but it is enough to cause quite the ruckus. They said we are carrying out murder/death policies. They said we are being compensated for killing people and administering remdesivir. They said we are forcing people to be on a ventilator because it kills these patients. They said they want to take control of the hospital and force us to ""actually treat"" patients.

>Meanwhile I spent my entire shift in an n95 trying to stabilize a dying patient maxed out on vent settings, yet still keeping sats below 70%. Couldn't titrate pressors fast enough. Couldn't sedate enough. Couldn't bring down the fever. Nothing lowered his heart rate below 145. Nothing we threw at this patient touched him. We were playing a waiting game for him to code. I wouldn't be surprised if he is dead now.

>I'm the death squad though.

>I spent whatever time not in the dying person's room trying to help my other patient understand the treatment options for COVID, assess why he didn't get vaccinated, why he was refusing the only treatments we know to show some benefit, and giving him the option to not be intubated. I wanted him to fully understand the treatments we were offering, and if he continues to refuse that's fine, but I'm not offering anything that will cause harm. I specifically said the refusal to be intubated is 100% your choice, and yes we do find that intubated people don't do well.. because they are already that sick, not because the breathing tube kills them.

>I'm ""enforcing death policies"" though.

>Like.... I can't with these people. The narratives they keep coming up with are just mind blowing and truly show the lack of knowledge we are dealing with.

Sobbing she died, calling out my daughters name, to only wake up and realize, this is reality... I felt embarrassed or scared of myself for a minute. Scared of my brain I mean. Like why hasn’t it accepted her death. 


Ugh I can’t articulate what happened.
I am able to express my emotions in my dreams but when awake I disassociate (or refuse to even think about) in order to not feel afraid  or depressed, as her and my dads death were back to back and both very traumatic. 

Watching someone you love die from cancer is insanely difficult. You would do anything to make it stop. However, seeing it makes acceptance easier too, as now their suffering is over. 

Well, my pain is worse again and my migraines are back. I need a breakthrough. I’m depressed for sure and feeling scared all the time. (I don’t know of what, the fleetingness of life perhaps or knowing not to make plans. They had lots of plans for retirement and both died at 65!))

Why did these republican senators vote to acquit? Because they are afraid of losing their jobs/elected seat. Well, what does that mean? This means that the people that they represent (that vote for them), would want them to vote 'acquittal'. If they vote to convict then their base wont like it and they wont get re-elected.

So in a really fucked up backwards way, the system is working?🤷 They are actually representing their people's vote?

Its fucked up, but thats the only way I can make today make sense in my head. And really we should be looking at those people these guys are representing, and not at the representatives themselves, they are sort of say... a 'messenger'.

I love all of what you said there, too. You're placing your value on the whole picture - how buying smaller and local can make huge differences and benefit all those important parts, and people, of your community/town/city. 

Just the idea of a fair, living wage AND being treated well as employees... think of how rare that is in any of those big discount stores and Amazon. One might offer one of those things, and certainly none of them offer both. 

The other true value parts are that if you learn to shop smart, you can get way better and fresher, tastier, healthier food, for not huge amounts more. But it becomes so worth it that way, plus you just feel better about the whole experience. You see you're directly supporting people in your community and local farms, small businesses and all their grateful employees. 

I've learned it's not an all or nothing, too. You can start buying just some of your grocery needs- maybe just your produce, or your meat/chicken/fish, etc. at smaller, local shops, stores or farmer's markets. You notice the differences right away too. I too think all of that together makes it more than worth it. 👍",2020-07-13 06:18:49

6ep9fd,"Here's some facts 

The Paris Climate Accord is crap.

Here is why:

-It is not binding. There are no enforceable fines on any participating government. This means if a country is in violation of it, there is no enforceable mechanism which, if actually enforceable, John Kerry admitted would have made many countries not sign on. “[If] there had been a penalty, we wouldn't have been able to get an agreement,” Kerry bluntly said. “So we did the best we could…”
-It relies on self reporting which China has already been caught fudging their coal burning numbers by about 14%. While reporting is mandatory, actual emissions reductions are not. China and India actually pushed for the lenient self reporting system too btw...wonder why? 
-It costs $100 billion dollars a year. What this goes for is to set up a world ""climate fund"" overseen by the UN. The purpose of this fund is to redistribute this money from wealthier nations to poorer ones. The UN announced this years ago, look up ""Climate Reparations."" 

This last reason is the real cause and why the media is hysterical at the prospect of Cheetoh Man™ pulling out of the agreement. The agreement has very little to do with actually combating green house gas emissions and operates as more of a global wealth redistribution mechanism administered by a global governing body that would further attempt to hen peck our industries out of even more money in fines. While governments would not be held accountable for these fines (as mentioned in the first bullet point), they would take regulatory guidance from the UN to establish the fines they could then levy on businesses. This significantly takes away national sovereignty over our industry and funnels it to international governance. 

If the goal really were to combat greenhouse gasses, then any country on earth could take the steps to do this themselves, voluntarily, without a need for any international agreement or treaty whatsoever. The mass media wants you to believe that is not possible. They are selling you manufactured outrage. The sole purpose of the agreement is global wealth redistribution and taking regulatory standards to an unaccountable, international governing body rather than more local governing bodies.

That's all.

Johnson, 55, tested positive for the virus at the end of March and has been battling symptoms for more than 10 days. He was taken to the hospital Sunday at the advice of his doctor, ***though his office insisted it was merely a precautionary measure.***""

j439g7,"it’s not bad. not bad at all. I had the biggest virus -the people in the hospital say they’ve never seen a bigger virus. so much dna packed into a capsule, all crammed in there. it was the size of a cell. the doctors 🔬said they didn’t know how to get rid of it, so they ended up using ultraviolet light like I suggested, thanks to some hard research on a QAnon website. They said “mr trump I never thought of that” and I told them I created it all by myself, it was all my idea I found on the website. and with a virus the size of a cell you’d think I would be dead like Sleepy Joe’s future. But no! all I got was a little cough, basically a sniffle even. i told Melania “is this allergies or is this the virus” because I couldn’t tell. the doctors said I got the biggest and best strand, but I didn’t even know I had it till I got one of those tests they do. No one tests like we do, folks, we’re #1 for testing. Not even communist China 🇨🇳 can compare. So the doctors said “no one had the virus like you did” and once they put me on hydroxyqlourine I was up and ready to go. And then like a miracle, it left my body. Maybe it was the bleach I took a swig of in the bathroom, I don’t know. My friends who had COVID said “mr Trump your bleach trick worked so well”. Everyone’s talking about my little bleach DIY 💉, it’s saved so many lives. brought back so many jobs. My kid, Eric, says that he told all his friends about my bleach trick and now they’re using it as a safe cure instead of wearing masks. Anyone can do it really, you just need some bleach and a needle. It’s a great, great trick I’ve used it many times and I’ve promoted it many times to my friends. Ghislaine Maxwell loves it! I bet Sleepy Joe still has some needles from his drug addict liberal son, so maybe you ask him or maybe find one on the street. I don’t know. Clorox says it’s a scam, but it’s not, that’s just what the fake news media wants you to believe because they’re all liberals. Everyone says I’m handling this very well, even the doctor said I’m putting on a brace face. They did one of those tests, with the frowning face and the happy face? I wasn’t feeling that good so I picked a three, right in between, but that wasn’t the virus, it was because the Fake News media is engaging in a Witch Hunt against me. 🥺 The doctors said I recovered so fast. No one recovered like me. I’m the best. Thank you for the wishes. I love you Putin, you’re my favorite Russian. We would be best friends if you lived closer😘. bottom line: I had the biggest fastest virus and I’m healthy so there’s no reason to panic. MAGA.",2020-10-03 01:56:47

It seems at first like the kind of thing that just fizzles out eventually, and Beijing will just continue to do whatever the hell they want to do, as always, a d protestors will eventually get bored. 

But on the other hand, it's been several weeks, and actually it isn't fizzling out at all, it's just getting bigger and bigger.

So what's the potential end game here? I mean, Beijing are no way just gonna give up Hong Kong, no way. That would require some huge colossal international intervention that is definitely not going to happen because none of the superpowers want to take a side on this. There's nothing in it for any of them. 

So... What then...? Hong Kong just keeps destroying itself until there's nothing left? Or until there's nothing left for Beijing to care about, and then Beijing eventually gives up the rights to Hong Kong because its now just a fucked up wasteland? Is that the only way it ends?

I mean your neighbors and normal people you know that vote the other side..LISTEN to each others perspective and stop TELLING each person what the other thinks..  that makes no sense!! everyone needs to really try to understand the other perspective and put preconceptions away. The other side thinks YOU are racist bigoted and brainwashed..the politicians on YOUR side want supreme power over everyone and YOU won’t listen to them.. the only part that’s true is the last one, no one listens to the other perspective because you know they won’t.. we’ll be the first. Go find someone and have them explain their perspective and try to understand it, not disprove it..you might learn something or at the very least you can see their point of view and stop fighting .. we can realize we just think the same thing of the other side, and that’s just keeping the focus away from where it needs to be. What are they doing?? It’s right in our faces too, we need to start listening to others before we get so separated that we can’t. This goes to both sides… if you believe the problem is on one side, don’t worry, it will fix itself if people just start paying attention more. People need to give other people more credit, we’re all very smart just VERY distracted.. If you don’t want to have conversations because THEY don’t listen,  you missed my whole point and you’re part of the problem in my opinion.. fighting solves NOTHING it just escalates things until one side is taken out… don’t be part of the problem. Start listening to other perspectives. We make better decisions with more information and perspectives. Half of the country isn’t out to get the other half, they’re afraid the other half is  after them, and it’s all a big distraction from the mess of incompetent career politicians all trying to cover their own assets while rushing through legislation to hang on to their power. It’s so obvious, but we’re all so focused and worried about winning an argument, that we say the most ridiculous things that don’t even matter, just to come out on top. It’s not about being right it’s about understanding the other perspective. You really think that THAT many people are THAT evil or callous? Or is this just what everyone that’s on your side knows to be a fact.

Depending on your state, you may have to have a license to be an architect, barber, chiropractor, dietician, esthetician, funeral director, genetic counselor, home health aide, inspector, librarian, massage therapist, notary public, optometrist, physician, real estate broker, social worker, timber agent, or wastewater apprentice. 
The state or states have decided that certain jobs can cause harm to the public if performed poorly. If you are a member of the public and things go really wrong during an encounter with one of these licensed professionals, you could complain to that licensed professional’s employer, someone who perhaps works with them every day, knows their kids’ names, and once threw up in their car after the company Christmas party. 
But if you feel like your complaint was not taken as seriously as you think it should be, you have the option of complaining to that particular licensing board. These are the people who issue the piece of paper that legally allows those professionals to do their job. They are often part of that profession themselves, so they have an interest in maintaining the public’s trust in that profession, as well as having some distance from that particular licensee so that it is easier to be objective. Licensed professionals often fear those boards more than they fear law enforcement. Law enforcement officials can affect your freedom. Licensing boards can affect your livelihood. Permanently if need be. There is often some communication between licensing boards of different states, so there is no guarantee that moving to a different state fixes anything. 
Do ANY states require law enforcement officials to be licensed? Honest question. I don’t know. My initial guess would be either ‘no’ or ‘very few’.
Why? If each does their job poorly, who has the potential to cause more harm to the public, a policeman or a plumber?
I don’t want to crap all over the police. I have friends who are policemen and they are good people. But something has to change. And requiring licensing (and perhaps even individual liability insurance so that public taxpayers are not on the hook for civil lawsuit awards resulting from offenses against a member of that same public) would be a positive step toward accountability that the public can have some confidence in, and you don’t have to ask cops to “rat” on their partner to do it.

This does not mean that 75 years’ worth of future accruals are advance-funded, only that the long-term sustainability of the system is measured over a 75-year period.

""The actuary calculates the value of all benefits to be paid out in the future, due to past and future service, and then subtracts out the value of the future accruals, to calculate the actuarial liability.""

https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/human-rights

If you follow a logical path of thought, that you think owning guns is a human right means this would need to be felt across the globe. Yet only a small set of people feel this way, most centered in the US, most Republican. So all you're basically saying is that *you* want guns and you therefore feel entitled to speak on behalf of the rest of the planet. But data shows that without political bribery and gerrymandering, gun regulations would already have happened by now. You've illegally manufactured authority, just like you're making shit up now.

There certainly aren't any statutes banning the resale of stamps by retailers and in fact this misconception is even answered on the [USPS webpage FAQ](https://faq.usps.com/s/article/Postage-Stamps-The-Basics):

>> **Can stamps be sold at a higher price?**

>>The Postal Service™ sells stamps at face value to everyone. We have no control over the pricing policies of private entrepreneurs, companies or agencies who resell our products.

At the end of the day if you need to get them at face value, they are always available from the post office, but for many people the convenience is worth the markup, and I don't see any reason why having that option is a bad thing.",2020-08-17 01:52:28

Now, I'm sure they expected Battlefront to do well, so if people actually voted with their money like they said, EA will come in making way less than they thought and the stock price will drop then.

Judge Margaret Chan - Lozito v. New York  c.2013

A town and its police department could not be sued for failing to enforce a restraining order, which had led to the murder of a woman's three children by her estranged husband.

Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales c.2005

The police do not owe a specific duty to provide police services to citizens based on the public duty doctrine.

Warren v. District of Columbia c.1981

The court held that a state government agency's failure to prevent child abuse by a custodial parent does not violate the child's right to liberty for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

DeShaney v. Winnebago County c.1989

Two social workers and two supervisors for the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, were fired and charged with child abuse and falsifying public records. These charges were ultimately dismissed by California’s 2nd District Court of Appeal for lack of probable cause. Additionally, 9 Sheriff's deputies were internally disciplined for not properly investigating the abuse allegations.

Netflix - The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez c.2020 

The Police and the State do not have to protect any of us and they don't, instead they protect capital. They were invented in their modern state to do just that. They have fewer regulations and fewer laws to follow than our military does in actual war zones and they get away with breaking the law without impunity more often than not due to district attorneys being able to override grand juries and the US Attorney General acquitting treason during both terms served. They attack us! Their own citizens because if they don't have to protect us from criminals then they sure don't need to protect us from themselves because they can't even do that. A cop in America with integrity gets punished or murdered for standing up to their fellow corrupt officers. Some of them are the same corrupt ones who have been part of the KKK, AB, and other supremacist groups for generations and they really started infiltrating law enforcement after Ruby Ridge and Waco while supporting and cheering the Oklahoma City Bombing. The FBI investigation into this infiltration has been funded from the late 90s until 2018 when the current administration pulled funding from it because some of them have ties to extremists as well.

This system is broken and has failed every American who isn't worth millions and billions for far, far too long. Lobbying in the United States was illegal until the 1950s and now it runs rampant to the point where the majority of Americans don't have the power to change policies and commit to reform because it costs more money than the majority of us have due to our economic system that fails us by keeping around 64% of the population living paycheck to paycheck while also being $500 away from complete financial ruin. That's how they kept the majority of us from protesting, by creating a system of individuality to where we're too busy to march and demand the values that are supposed to exist in the first place.

They break up our communities and gatherings because they don't want us talking about the corrupt system and how to deal with it. We need to protest and make our voices not only heard but drilled into the minds of all who work and represent us because they have forgotten that's what they're supposed to do.

American schools taught us a very different history and to pledge allegiance to this country. No other countries besides DPRK, Brazil, and Russia on Monday mornings forced children to do such a thing before they knew what any of those words truly meant while punishing us if we don't say it. Children pledging to a system that fails them constantly by not saving their lives from very preventable deaths creates them to become loyal and put their lives on the line so others can make more money and retain the status quo.

The America that were told from a very young age until death is the best country in the world, the land of opportunity, the melting pot, the land of the free, the land where justice is served, God's Country™ and equality for all citizens. This has been and continues to be the biggest lie I was ever told. The actual America preaches all of the best values yet follows very few of them and claims it has always had them when it clearly hasn't because if this America exists then none of this would be happening at all, right now!. In a just America, we would have taken the responsibility and paid reparations to the Black Community, not just for slavery but also for the Tulsa race massacre. We would have paid reparations to Native Americans for the mass genocide that occurred and still does. We would make all of our colonies states because the citizens of said countries fight and die for us in our military. We would have helped Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. We would pay reparations to the Japanese Americans and asylum seekers at the southern border we put in concentration camps and separated from their families. Sadly, this isn't the America we've been told but there is still the American Dream™

What we have are the people with all the assets making the rules. So the rules all prop up asset prices. It’s why young people can’t afford to buy homes. Stop propping up assets creates opportunities which is not what someone at the top wants. 2008 proved our economy is not a free market. It is nationalized. The 1% get most of the profits during the boom years and the tax payer takes on most of the risk when things go bad. The tax payer actually made money from investments made after crash in 2008 but that won’t always happen. If the pandemic causes a lot of defaults on bonds and investments the Fed have poured billions into it will hurt so they will continue to print money until the US is the bubble and we pop.",2020-10-09 10:16:07

In my industry it goes Lvl 1, Lvl 2, Senior, Principle, so on so on.
  
3 years in, you should be getting towards lvl 2 if you aren't already there. 
  
I applied for a lvl 2 role with a company. Did 3 interviews. Got offered the role with a slight pay increase from what I was making at the time. Verbally accepted it. Got the written offer and found they were going to bring me in as a lvl 1.
  
Called them thinking it was a mistake. ""No, we just have some other employees at that level right now so bringing you in might ruffle feathers even though we have no doubts about your qualifications. We'd be willing to discuss the pay rate if that's something we could negotiate?""
  
Had to turn the job down. 1) the whole thing felt like a bait and switch 🚩 2) I later found out that company has a rule that you can't be promoted within 1 year of hire which they only enforce when they feel like it 🚩 3) keeping employees with 3 years relevant experience at entry level for no other reason than fear they'd have to give appropriate promotions based on their own experience targets is foolish at best. 🚩

I’ve given away blankets, jackets, food while living in my car in Denver because I encountered someone who I felt needed it more. I had a car, and I sometimes managed day labor, so I reasoned I could replace those items more easily than these folks could go get it. I have never had much but I’ve always liked to share. It makes me feel like I’m not fully enslaved by my ape brain or its natural tribalism.

Not feeling okay keeping much of what I have (just for myself) was probably as much of a symptom of dysfunction as the unrelenting greed that allows megacorps to consistently put profits over prudence.",2022-04-13 22:01:50

Cutting the list price of its non-branded insulin, Insulin Lispro Injection 100 units/mL, to $25 a vial. Effective May 1, 2023, it will be the lowest list-priced mealtime insulin available, and less than the price of a Humalog® vial in 1999.  
Cutting the list price of Humalog® (insulin lispro injection) 100 units/mL1, Lilly's most commonly prescribed insulin, and Humulin® (insulin human) injection 100 units/mL2 by 70%, effective in Q4 2023.  
Launching RezvoglarTM (insulin glargine-aglr) injection, a basal insulin that is biosimilar to, and interchangeable with, Lantus® (insulin glargine) injection, for $92 per five pack of KwikPens®, a 78% discount to Lantus, effective April 1, 2023.""",2023-03-01 15:49:29

*”…both studies lend support to an authoritarianism symmetry hypothesis: Significant positive correlations emerged between LWA and measurements of liberalism, prejudice, dogmatism, and attitude strength. These results largely paralleled those correlating RWA with identical conservative-focused…”*

5njj2x,"FYI, you are supposed to always have both EpiPens with you. You are to apply the second pen if the first one doesn't enable breathing in an extreme case. I have a daughter with peanut and tree nut allergies and we buy two sets, one for school (required by school) and one that stays with her in a pouch all the time. We don't bother giving to relatives houses, she just always has her primary set with her.

This is from their website:
> Approximately 20% of patients—about 1 in 5—who receive an initial dose of epinephrine for treatment of anaphylaxis require a second dose. Why? Sometimes an allergic reaction can be so severe, a second dose of epinephrine is required. In other cases, a second allergic reaction can occur 1 to 72 hours (usually within 8 hours) after the initial reaction—even with no further exposure to the allergic trigger. Therefore, it is important that patients at increased risk for anaphylaxis have two doses of epinephrine available.

>For your convenience, both EpiPen® and EpiPen Jr® Auto‑Injectors are available in EpiPen 2‑Pak® and EpiPen Jr 2-Pak® cartons. It’s important that you keep both EpiPen® Auto‑Injectors together at all times. That way, an extra dose is available if it’s needed. More than two sequential doses of EpiPen® Auto‑Injector should be administered only under direct medical supervision.

> Make sure you speak with your healthcare professional about how to identify the signs and symptoms of a life‑threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). If you, your child or someone you're caring for shows signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis, administer EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr® Auto‑Injector immediately as prescribed and seek emergency medical care. Take the used EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr® Auto‑Injector with you to the emergency room for inspection and disposal. Please read the full Prescribing Information.
",2017-01-12 20:29:00
5njj2x,"[The EpiPen manufacturer recommends room temperature](https://www.epipen.com/hcp/about-epipen/safety-and-storage):

> EpiPen® and EpiPen Jr® (epinephrine injection, USP) Auto-Injectors should be stored in the carrier tube provided at a temperature of 25ºC (77ºF); however, temperature excursions between 15ºC and 30ºC (59ºF to 86ºF) are permitted.1 EpiPen® and EpiPen Jr® Auto-Injectors should not be stored in refrigerators or in a vehicle’s glove box.1 EpiPen® Auto-Injectors should not be exposed to extreme heat or cold and should be protected from light.

[To avoid bacteria growth in food, the FDA recommends](http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm093704.htm): 
> Keep the refrigerator temperature at or below 40° F (4° C).

So keeping EpiPens in the fridge puts them about 19° F too low for the 'excursion' temperature.

How?

This kinda comes off like you’re just upset that other people may get a lucky break that you didn’t. Which I can understand as a knee jerk emotional reaction but please think it out more 

I went to jail for marijuana possession one time, knowing it was against the law. I do not oppose those expunged recently for weed crimes, despite not being included in them myself. I did more jail time for a gram of weed than almost anyone today would get.. but I don’t get mad when I hear penalties have been reduced over the years, I’m happy 

I guess we just see things different somewhere because I figure you should be happy that other people don’t have to deal with something that you did. That’s progress, to me

For instance, I'm sure Pope Francis (being Argentinean) will be hoping for Argentina to win in the upcoming World Cup. That doesn't make Argentina the official team of the Catholic Church and Catholics don't have to follow that just because they're Catholic.

My brother flipped a mattress and hid against that while on the phone with my nephew who was on the freeway with his mom - pleading with them to pull over and run into whatever building was closest. My newlywed cousin and his wife hunkered down in their laundry room, saying their goodbyes just in case; hoping for the best, but bracing for the worst. 

I was in public with friends when I first heard the news. Cried until I knew they were all safe. STILL tearing up a little on and off, imagining what they (and everyone on the island) went through. I simply cannot fathom that level of helpless panic.

Like any other public program, sometimes it clear the problem is training based or administrative, and that's when you increase budget to give them the tools they need to succeed. Other times, the failure is coming from accountability, and taking away resources with a clear objective of what to do to get them back is the best option.

ckdmh3,"BLS, CPR, and First Aid Instructor here. 

HOLY FUCK! We all just watched a murder due to incompetence and everyone seems so nonchalant about it. What the fuck, I am so angry and sad I can’t stop crying right now.

I hope everyone’s attitude is because they don’t see what I see in this video, so let me explain.

These Cops 1000000% killed this man with their ignorance and apathy.

First off the prone position they put him in has killed thousands of people. It is a shit restraining move and should never be used for prolong periods of time like it is here. Why you ask? Two reasons. One because it is basically torture and puts undue stress on the body. Two, imagine if I put 100 pounds of pressure on your chest for a long period of time you would have a hard time breathing and eventual pass out (just like he does in the video when he stops talking) and then if I keep that pressure applied when your unconscious your body can’t fight the additional gravity and will die from lack of oxygen (just like he FUCKING did). Essentially they slowly suffocated this man to death. While he was awake he had to manually fight to breath and fill his lounges because breathing normally isn’t going to work in this position, but you can’t keep that up forever (especially with the added effects of the drugs he is on). Eventually the stress of that position will cause you to pass out and you can see about half way through this video he stops talking and it is at that point he is conscious. But the cops keep him in this position for a long time after he is unconscious (It is hard to tell how long he is unconscious before paramedics arrive but I’ll go over their fuck ups later). By keeping that added pressure on his back they simply are stopping him from breathing while he is unconscious because the body can’t fight gravity and that officers weight. 

Now to be fair cops get shit for CPR training and that is were the real incompetence of this murder comes in. If they had realized at any point before loading him into the ambulance the signs of death the cops of EMTs could have saved this man. I noticed right when he stopped talking, the first time he asked if he was alright and he didn’t respond. 

At several points in the video the victim twitches or snorts or gasps and the officers take this as a response. However everyone in this video should know better, EVERYONE! Gasping or snorting is what we call Aganol breathes it is a sign of death and when I train officers and emts I make a point of going over this, the twitching is also a sign of death. Everyone in this video ignores all the signs this person is dying. (This was incredibly hard for me to watch, but good news is from now on I will addressing this video specifically in my classes.) 

Here is the even sadder part. If they had just gotten off his back the first time the cop asked if the victim was ok he probably would have resuscitated himself. The cop not caring enough to actually check properly for breathing or pulse and the shitty training they receive killed this man. 

Now the Paramedics. What the actual fuck! Despite the cops murdering this person the Paramedics  didn’t even bother in this video with fuck all. If they had done their job properly they could have most likely saved this man. They administered Narcan, which is fantastic. But at no point do they even check their patient for breathing or pulse until he is loaded into the ambulance. The video cuts off at this point and I hope they started CPR after the video cuts off but from how little they cared in the video I doubt it.

Now in all fairness cops can be assholes to paramedics and emts, so maybe they just didn’t wanna deal with these cops or something. However, that is no excuse for not doing the very basics for you patient. At no point do they check his vitals. When I teach BLS and ALS I drill this concept into my students CHECK, CHECK, CHECK; check the scene for safety, check for responsiveness, check for ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation). They administer a drug before they even check vitals that is fucked up. 

Now here is the even sadder part. They might have thought he was dead when they arrived and just went through the motions to cover their butts, their is a high likely hood of this. Which is even sadder that these scenarios happen so frequently the paramedics don’t even bother anymore. 






Chances are no one is going to read my comment  and this will have been wasted effort on my part. But I already feel so much better just getting my anger in writing. I just taught a Lay Responder CPR class today and teaching two tomorrow and even though that man died for no reason I will start making a point to address these fuck ups in my classroom. 

How can the world be so apathetic toward each other? This video will never leave my brain, I will carry it with me until the day I die. Because it highlights just how little we care about each other. The people sworn to protect us get so little training on how to protect us they are more likely to kill us then save us, and no one cares. The people that we employ to save us sometimes don’t even care to make a basic effort. 

According to the American Heart Association 9 out of 10 times by the time EMS arrives for a cardiac arrest emergency the person is already dead. The main reason for this is the bystander effect and no early cpr (only 6% of the population is certified in cpr that is all, for a nation that says they care we don’t even learn the basics of saving lives). 45% of the time the person never receives early CPR, to put that into perspective that is about 150,000 people a year die and where never even given a chance are being saved. That is 1 out of every 20 deaths we are just meh about. Now for the sadder part, that number is probably closer to 1 out of 10 people die and weren’t given a chance at survival, because that 150,000 is just cardiac arrest emergencies you’re not talking about strokes, bleeding to death, allergies, or any other first aid emergencies. What the fuck is wrong with us.

I also think that while it is really important to acknowledge the US’s issues, most people are aware about the detention centers at the US border. These other issues... not so much. That’s unfortunate because it will be hard for them to help themselves. Look at the uphill battle Hong Kong is facing. If nothing else, China needs to be held accountable even if we’re not right next door. The world eye has, in my opinion, held China accountable for its actions against Hong Kong. It may have even been enough to prevent a repeat of Tiananmen Square. 

I don’t want people to detract from the little attention that these issues are getting (compared to US issues), so I hope I didn’t come across as aggressive. I’m just tired of seeing some Americans who don’t look outside of what is happening in their own country.

I was staying at a friends house and quite late into the night I went out to the alley (they lived in a block of identical terraced houses) to take a phone call and after I was finished and going back in, i realised the door to alley gate had swung closed behind me. 

So I went to go back in after struggling to get the gate open due to something having collapsed against it and wedging it closed (so I thought...) I made my way back into the downstairs living room.

The place was in darkness as everyone had gone to bed before I went out for the call. So there I was stumbling around the house when a number of thoughts crossed my mind;

""Wonder where the dog is:S...?""

""FUCK, I let the dog out when I went outside""

""Why is the couch over there?""

""Who are these people in these photographs?""

""FUUUUUUUUUCK, i've broken into the wrong house😱""

a6iz22,"Me as a person who worked at Walmart for 4 years and it being my first job ever I know the feeling all to well.  I quit about 5 months ago and I was a full time employee with benefits.  I started off as a maintenance (more like Janitor) and 9 months after the assistant manager that was over me would have me help the unloaders unload the trucks for half my shift.  It was unfair seeming that back then the people who unloaded the trucks would get more pay than the maintenance people.  I asked to have my position changed to the unloader team for the next 2 months and they would promise but never happened until like the 3rd month of working on unloading trucks.  I remember the store manager would actual call the employees dumb or stupid in front of their face whenever they did something wrong.  The guy did a good job at managing the store i'm not going to lie but his skills with communicating with people weren't good at all.  Several people claimed that he would do drugs in the back room inside of the freezers every now and then lol.  Anyways the unloader team eventually became what they call Cap 2 nowadays and omg the amount of shit they would make us do in 8+ hours.  They said overtime wasn't mandatory but in the end they would tell us that if we left without finishing the job we would get written up.  Keep in mind that we had to unload 1 or 2 trucks and seeming that one could take up between 1 - 2 hours depending on the size but usually it was almost 2 hours and after that they would split our 12 person crew into different areas to stock the merchandise that we just unloaded.  The main departments that we were in charge of stocking was consumables like HBA (health and beauty stuff), Chemicals (laundry detergent), Paper (toilet paper and paper plates), Infants (diapers and formula), Groceries and Pharmacy.  Keep in mind that this stuff had several hours of merchandise, specially the chemicals and groceries would get hit hard with like 10+ hours worth of merchandise to stock.  So yeah that shit sucked these people think that all the team member were fucking robots with infinite stamina or something cause they didn't want to hear excuses on why we didn't finish on time.  Towards the end of me being there it felt like the new people they added to our crew were the teenagers who barely had any experience in working because the managers would take advantage of them kinda like mind fucking them.  Making them feel guilty about leaving even after their shift was over.  Most young people are still gullible and would fall for there ""talks"" and me seeming that I was there for a while and knew how the managers were I would tell them that it was ok to leave.  In the end I think Walmart can be an awesome place to work at but the only thing that fucks it up is management.  Everytime I would hear stories from a person who transferred from another store I would find it hard to believe of how good it sounded lol and after a while some people would transfer back or just quit in general.  The only thing I miss at walmart is the old crew I used to work with seeming that there was like 4 of us left from the time that I started working there.  Fuck walmart lol at least the management team I don't regret walking out on them 👌  ",2018-12-16 02:17:45

9l5djc,"What do people expect? They're getting a pay raise which will help them immediately. If the other perks were that big of a deal why weren't they ever mentioned when people were upset about the low pay??

I thought the point here was to give them a livable wage so tax payers didn't need to cover the difference through welfare. Seems like these goal posts never stop moving.

Hell I bet if every worker was given a new car tomorrow people would be up in arms that it was just the base model and not fully equipped 🤦‍♂️

Edit: Downvote away. You'll complain that they don't get a liveable wage but then also complain they don't get stock options. Next you'll complain that everyone isn't getting an equal share of the profits... It's no wonder people on the other side don't take you seriously AT ALL. You have no clue what is a reasonable ask and will never be happy with anything.

In my experience, people pretty much need to solve their own crimes. There was a story years ago about a woman who was assaulted. She had to go on Fb to find the guys. She told the cops, an they did nothing. Later, the cops raided her house bc they suspected someone had drugs.

evq34r,"> and two counts of illegal possession of a firearm as a felony offender.

Yeah, now I can see why the headline conveniently *left that part out*.

I thought that we all wanted to get tough on criminals with guns! No? No? We don’t? I didn’t get the memo on that.

>Thompson, then 45, was arrested during the drug sale where no weapons were recovered on him or in his vehicle. The guns were recovered from his home after a search warrant was executed on Dec. 19, 1994.

Is the fact that he was a felon who possessed guns supposed to be mitigated by the fact that they weren’t on him *that time?*

> ""He has never committed a violent act,"" according to the ""Free Michael Thompson"" online petition. ""Michael was labeled violent because police found guns at his house, even though in Michigan people can legally and openly carry guns.

Yeah, *NON-CRIMINAL* people in Michigan can legally and openly carry guns.

*WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS RECIDIVIST FELON—  
WHO WAS EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM EVEN TOUCHING ONE ROUND OF AMMUNITION, LET ALONE POSSESSING GUNS?!*

I had chronic bladder infections because I got gang raped and beaten to an inch of my life every weekend, so I had no bladder control.  My pediatrician told her that I had torn flesh in my rectum and vagina, from repeated contact with a sharp, jagged object. She told my mom to keep a better eye on me in the bathtub because at (7) I was allegedly putting G.I. Joes into my butt and vagina for fun.  

As I work through the dissociation and psychogenic amnesia, I note that nobody ever mentioned the bruises I had to be covered with, from neck to feet.  I had adult men waiting turns to choke me unconscious. I’m trying to imagine how few shits any of them gave about anything back then.

That gave my mom the idea to blame and silence me, tell the family that I am a messed up kid she just can’t do anything with. Please use my story to verbally bludgeon anyone who argues against or fails at mandatory reporting.  🧜‍♀️",2021-01-24 18:01:08

j8imfh,"I’m pretty sure our educational system isn’t in the crapper anywhere near the levels that the US is. It’s just that Conservatives are inherently gullible. 

I’ll give you an example. In Alberta the NDP was elected in a majority by accident (basically people wanted to send the Cons a message that they’re weren’t happy but there was no way anyone was going to vote Liberal so they voted even farther to the left). They implemented a lot of good policies that were important for diversifying the economy and improving a number of things. But they cost money and that means that Alberta ended up with a budget deficit for the first time in quite a while. 

So the Cons ran on budget issues and literally told everyone “listen we’re going to cut funding to Education, healthcare, seniors coverage ETC.” and got elected. Then people were fucking surprised when they cut everything they promised to cut. I pointed this out to a number of people at work and the response was “well ya. Those cuts needed to happen, we pay Teachers and Nurses too much (the fuck!?). I just didn’t think they were going to effect *me*.”

Conservative voters in every country aren’t inherently dumb just gullible. They simply think that what their leaders discuss won’t actually effect them just other people. And no type of critical thinking will help them see the light because it’s so fucking obvious what will happen you shouldn’t even need to think about it.

Or better yet Albertans bitching about the pipeline and how the Liberals in Ottawa wont do anything to help us out. Harper has a decade to get that pipeline pushed through and did Jack shit (because he know the province will always vote for the Cons).

All in all, I think people like Pai are indicative of the final decline of our Republic. He'll do a Robert Rubin: a couple swings through the revolving door, ultimately ending up with a couple board memberships and ""counselor"" status at one of the major telecoms with a payout in the tens or hundreds of millions. He knows he's got this coming, that he's in the process of securing the affluence of his lineage for two or three generations, provided he makes good on one or two deliverables for the industry, like net neutrality.

7iml84,"I saw your comment while at a breakfast diner and saved it until I could get home. 
  
Whether you are conservative or liberal will factor in highly to whether or not you believe my argument(s). 
  
Net Neutrality, for all it's supposed goodliness, is quite literally, a way for the federal government to regulate the internet. See, before 2015 Comcast and probably Verizon and some other big Internet Service Providers (ISPs) were caught trying to throttle some traffic of content providers (CPs) like Netflix etc. Basically, ISPs would throttle these sites and charge them more almost like a protection bracket.
  
Now pre-2015, this kind of thing was usually handled between ISPs and CPs  (Netflix, Amazon, Google etc.). The ISPs and CPs legal teams would do battle and a deal would usually be worked out. In 2015, the Obama administration stepped in and strongly recommended a regulated internet. Not that anything was really wrong with the internet anyway but at the time they used the greed of ISPs against CPs to make it seem like those same ISPs would try to throttle consumers like you and me, the fear being that a throttled or paid prioritized internet would destroy the ""free and open internet of this great country"". This is in Stark contrast to the 20 previous years to 2015 when the Internet worked just fucking fine and no ISP big or small ever tried to throttle any consumer, ever. 
  
So in 2015 Obama basically circumvented Congress and The Constitution and reclassified the internet as a common carrier under Title II or the 1934 telecommunications act which is essentially step 1 of a multi step plan to have a government regulated internet (think China). The internet was reclassified as a common carrier and made subject to a wide variety of government regulations under the FCC. Not that the FCC really understood it's new power or how best to use it, it basically fell into it's lap. 
  
So for the past 18 months or so we've had a government regulated internet. The FCC doesn't really want to censor the net in any way and would be a lot happier letting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) handle the internet (which is how it worked pre-2015 in fact anti trust laws are a specific set of laws that are supposed to prevent things like throttling or paid prioritizing in the first place). 
  
So now, in 2017, we're at a precipice of sorts, Ajit Pai and the Trump administration want to role back Obama's regulatory measures, reestablish the FTC as the main regulatory body of the internet and generally reestablish sanity in the internet market so that companies can compete against one another  like they did before. Reddit, Google, Netflix and a bunch of liberal organizations are staunchly opposed to this mostly because Trump is the one doing it but also because Comcast could theoretically go back to extorting money from CPs like Netflix. 
  
Now you may be thinking to yourself what about me? Won't I be throttled and paid prioritized also? The answer is yes you could be. Depending on where you live it could be bad too. If, for instance, Comcast is the only ISP in your area, they could throttle you and you'd theoretically be stuck purchasing whatever package they offered you. 
  
But that's pretty much BULLSHIT.
  
Comcast and other large ISPs are making like 80% profits already. They aren't really incentivized to ruin the internet for all of their customers. Not to mention that if so-called Net Neutrality was abolished it would also theoretically allow for Joe Schmoe to start ""Joe Schmoes ISP"" and compete with big ISPs in your area (especially important if you're rural). Under the current net neutrality regulations nobody anywhere can start a new ISP at all unless they have lots of $$$ and legal savvy to lay new fiber and build new infrastructure. 
  
Websites like Reddit and Google and Amazon would have you believe that big ISPs are trying to kill the internet but what they are really trying to do is save their bottom line by false flagging big ISPs as the devil and screaming at the government to step in and regulate the fuck out of everything. If you've paid even a slight bit of attention to history or know basic economics , you'd realize that anything the government tried to regulate withers and dies like the 🌹 from Beauty and the Beast. Happened with Healthcare.gov and with the New Deal and with pretty much any private industry the government has ever tried to control. 
  
It's not even really a partisan issue, Republicans are probably more for a regulated internet than against but because they desperately need votes (because Trump is making them all look bad) they need to staunchly oppose new government regulations in order for their constituents to actually keep them in office.
  
So to recap, liberals and giant tech companies are lying to you about ISPs being evil to save their own bottom line and have set up a proxy war over the last 10 years or so to try and get the internet regulated like water or phone service. In reality, if big ISPs tried to pull that bullshit scary stuff like throttling they'd most likely get dicked by the FTC over anti trust laws. Reddit in particular (for me) has been almost unusable due to the net neutrality circlejerk. Especially when you actually do the research and realize that companies are generally better at fighting their own battles. It's pretty shitty for CPs to run screaming to the government to intervene when that's just eventually going to ruin the internet even worse than Comcast or Verizon ever could. 
  
What I truly don't understand is why liberals are so for NN. A lot of nu-age liberals I see on the internet nowadays proclaim as loudly as possible to hate the rich white men that are in control of our government, yet when the question of NN is brought up they are all for those same rich white men to regulate the crap out of the internet. It's basically like kids on Twitter and Reddit don't understand economics and are selling the internet to the government over the supposed threat of the scary ISPs. 
  
Personally I would rather be throttled the fuck out of every single day for the rest of my life than let the government regulate the internet the next 30 years. They truly don't understand how it works and frankly, ISPs and the people they employ understand the internet far better than any career politician ever will. 
  
Finally I'd like to say I've never ever voted for a republican (or for that matter democratic) president. I'm not being paid to write this thesis of a comment. I'm just a dude in New England who has actually looked into both sides of this debate and after seeing how healthcare.gov worked out for most people, is staunchly against the government sticking it's paws into the net.

>This isn't a career, it's an ""opportunity""

Dana White, President of the UFC 🍅🍅🍅

This guy also claimed something along the lines of ""we didn't cut any employees due to Covid"" while culling the shit out of the UFC's roster and signing a shit ton of young, fresh, cheap, potential talent at or near the UFC's minimum contract rate, which is something around 12k/12k ($12,000 to fight regardless of result, and an extra $12k if you win). 

Yeah, you didn't 'cut any jobs' because your fighters aren't actually 'employees', they're 'independent contractors'

Mind you, they have to wear their official UFC™ uniform when they fight, and can't have any personal sponsors (anymore). Meanwhile the ring they're fighting in is second only to NASCAR in terms of aesthetic..

Oh, and they also can only fight exclusively with the UFC, not any other MMA organization.

I can't 100% back this up, so take it with with a grain of salt, but I believe they've even stopped fighters from taking fights in other sports, such as kick boxing or ADCC. How's that for independent?",2021-04-30 00:28:36

Have you ever heard of worker co-ops? Getting them to actually become the norm in the US is going to take a lot of canvassing because *""That sounds like socialism!!""™*, but it sounds like you'd be totally on board with that.

Would you have to pick one of your clients and declare them your employer? I assume you have something like an s corp though.

n7xrzd,"I used to think the same thing. I spent the last year of my best doggo's life fighting Lymphoma and making memories. (Paw print paintings, clay prints, etc.) It was hard to watch him deteriorate slowly over the year, not knowing he would have to leave me, but I have to believe that animals know when they're passing away, I think they just accept it.

I told myself I wasn't sure I would ever own another pet too. Then I realized that as much as I missed my best friend every day, there wasn't anything that would bring him back to me. If I didn't put my heart out there for another friend and to give them the best life I could, then I'd just always feel... empty. I missed having my doggo bring me toys the moment I walked into the house after I got off of work for the day, and the smiles he put on my face every day.

I started volunteering at a local shelter and started opening myself up to adopting a new pup. The amount of love they are all ready to give is overwhelming, and they deserve a loving home. I figured even if I didn't adopt one, I could help find them good homes, but it doesn't take long to find one that melts away the wall of grief from losing your pet.

They only break your heart once, but once is enough to break your soul too, if you let it. I'm sorry for your loss, and I hope your heal your heart to love another. ❤",2021-05-09 00:07:55

sqsakk,"….😐😐 dude. No. That’s just blatantly not true at all. I don’t know where you’re getting your history from but the KKK did not capture criminals. They weren’t a vigilante public service. They were extremists who didn’t like blacks mixing with whites and resisted the federal government passing civil rights laws, by lynching black people and by terrorizing black families who moved into white neighborhoods. I study history, specifically the civil rights era and racial issues. Look up Emmit Till. That’s just one case of violent deadly racism. There’s countless cases. This is not a part of culture to celebrate. This is a part of culture to understand honestly so we can make sure to not relive it. 

A lot of woke shit is stupid and annoying but this is not one of them. It’s important to celebrate the ending of segregation and to unify us all in peace. Remembering those who had the courage to risk their lives for a cause that helped progress society. Why highlight the KKK who holds us back? Why would you care about skin color so much that you kill people based on it? That’s what they did. That isn’t opinion. It’s a matter of fact. There are volumes and volumes of recorded, documented history with court cases and photographs that prove the KKK was a deeply violent and racist group.

To me it also feels like the ""Preconventional"" stage from Kohlberg's stages of moral development.  The blatant self-interest and the black and white thinking around good and bad—bad equals punishment / good equals reward etc. 

So in other words, the stage of moral development that a literal baby is at 😅

>
It's why pointing out that all their politicians are raging hypocrites never works, they literally don't believe that it's wrong for their ""side"" to do the exact same shit they try to demonize democrats for.

This. It makes so much more sense when you realize this aspect of how they are. You can pull your hair out forever trying to get them to care that they are hypocritical.

 But because of the simplistic/inverted way they think about ""good"" and ""bad"" they almost can't even fully acknowledge the concept of hypocrisy—bc if they did then the whole tower of cards would come crumbling down.

 It seemingly doesn't make sense to them why being that way might be inherently not okay or unfair to others or even just offensive or obnoxious to deal with, so to me that indicates they don't or can't really understand what it is. (Or, if they do understand and still do it intentionally, that just means they're a psychopath) 

 Because they also to whatever extent are projecting that same idea onto the other side at the same time—They think it's a big game that you win by playing dirty and being the biggest hypocrite. 

 They think of being good at THOSE things as being successful and as something to be even proud of. And it just doesn't occur to them that anyone else might authentically NOT think of this stuff like a shitty game. 

So I think when they hear anyone else claim to believe in reasonably sound principles or just actually good things like justice and democracy etc, or say when people accuse them of being the blatant hypocrites that they obviously are, and so on—they just assume ""Oh everyone else must think like I do... but just secretly... (looks around) Isn't that what you're supposed to do to win this game?"" 

And so ironically they probably end up seeing the most authentic people as the most INauthentic people of all.

 But another layer is also they therefore weirdly admire that ""skill"" and might even be jealous of this 4-D chess strategy they are imagining is happening in the other person's mind (but really is just someone being authentic and not trying to be a hypocrite).

 It's a strange kind of distortion, paranoid distrust of everyone.",2022-05-26 00:11:04

Our Revolution (commonly known by its initials OR) is an American progressive political action organization spun out of Senator Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign to continue its work. The organization's mission is to educate voters about issues, get people involved in the political process, and work to organize and elect progressive candidates. Our Revolution is also the title of a book by Sanders released in November 2016.",2020-03-02 03:08:23

6uj3ph,"There are three pills:

The Bluepill: drink the koolaid and live the lie.

The Redpill: see the real nature of the system and reject to live in a fancy lie.

The Blackpill: similar to taking the red pill except in this case the system is completely hopeless. It's going full on nihilist/apathetic because the system is a lie and you can't game it either even when knowing the truth.


Obviously, you have to take context into account. Here's a good example: dating women as a straight man.

The Bluepill: women care more about your personality and you should treat them as your equal.

The Redpill: women care about your physical attractiveness, social status, resources and finally your nice personality. They also don't respect a man who sees them as equal. You play the system right by realising this and acting accordingly.

The Blackpill: you're a short, balding, skinny guy. You have no realistic chance with any average women no matter how much you improve your appearance, social status or personality. Even the least attractive women will reject you most of the time. You better stop wasting your time looking for intimacy and focus on your life and maybe use prostitutes if you want to get at all close to an attractive woman. 

EDIT: NOW DO YOU TAKE THE BLUEPILL OR THE REDPILL (which might just turn out to be a blackpill, hence why it's dangerous)!?? 🤔    ",2017-08-18 23:28:00

The reason Chauvin was charged with 3rd degree murder is so the prosecution has a much better chance to find him guilty and not get off on some BS loophole defense. Does he deserve 1st degree murder, especially given his past transgressions? Absolutely. Would he be able to get out of a 1st degree murder charge? Yes. 

Again, he deserves 1st degree murder charges and jail time. That doesn’t mean it was a slam dunk to happen, at all. That’s why he’s getting charged with 3rd degree murder, to make sure he can and hopefully will be found guilty and punished to the fullest extent possible with the charges.

EDIT: I’ve misspoken. What I meant to say is he wouldn’t be charged with 1st degree, as that has to have a premeditation and intent to kill behind it. I think what they charged him with fits the crime. What I was more so getting at is there are people that want him in jail forever, which I get, and if he’s convicted in court, whatever jail time he gets will be less than what he probably deserves. My main point was that he was charged correctly, and prosecution has a better chance of being successful BECAUSE they took a little more time to nail down a charge. Please don’t quote anything with 1st degree in it because I’m an idiot. I definitely am an idiot. 🙈",2020-06-01 18:09:02

When you say the south, you are saying why is it NOT okay to own slaves and what was so wrong with the slave-holding way of life. Terrible analogy.

8d16p5,"> In September 1949, Barbara’s parents were involved in a car accident in which her mother was instantly killed. Since she was pregnant, Barbara was advised not to travel from California to the funeral, and the event left a lasting scar. Three months later, the couple welcomed a second child, a daughter named Pauline Robinson Bush in honor of Barbara’s late mother. In October 1953, the child, nicknamed “Robin,” died of leukemia, leaving Barbara and her husband devastated. It was during this traumatic time that Barbara’s reddish-brown hair turned prematurely white.

She had so many tragedies, I hope she finally gets some rest 😞

Cher can keep performing in Vegas until the day she dies but people are going to refer to her peak in the 70s forever.

Dr. Fauci is the Hero we may not Deserve, but Dr. Fauci the Hero we Need right now.

He’s our White Knight in our dark hour.


- - - 


Dr. Fauci  received the Presidential Medal of Freedom 12 years ago, in 2008 from President Bush.

He turns 80 next year.

He currently works 18 hour days, 6 days a week.

He is swimming against political currents that would hinder, drown and engulf lesser men.

Props to his wife for taking care of HIM.

With respects to those who say may say otherwise,  in my book,  the man is a Hero.


- - - -

Dr. Fauci’s Presidential Medal of Freedom was endorsed by national peers, earned and well deserved;  it was not a baseless political tool used by the current power brokers.

The doctor’s actions in the last months, despite opposition from some circles have proven that his own medal is not tarnished nor diminished by the actions of others who would brandish theirs as an undeserved badge.

jadmis,"I totally get where you're coming from and generally agree. However as a former science teacher I think there's absolutely value behind exposing all kids to science content.

Some of it is generally useful in life, but like you're saying a lot if it is super specific and only useful for those that go into STEM fields. I saw both sides of it as a physics teacher. Some kids were excited by the super in-depth science content, and it gave them confidence in themselves and an increased desire for a college education. For others it needlessly beat down their confidence (ex: kids who loved and excelled in English/Social Studies but whose gaps in algebra mastery left little hope of finding satisfaction in physics the way my district's curriculum was set up). Some of that could be addressed with a bit more class differentiation - I think the science that everyone should know is not the same thing as the science that should be available to the kids that really care about it. Giving the kids that choice between two differently structured science classes would serve both groups way more effectively, and lead to less frustration about knowing specifics removed from everyday life (i.e. mitochondria being the powerhouse of the cell 😂). I think offering more choice in exactly what science they're learning is a good step, but to me it's a somewhat separate issue from the gaps in real world skills like taxes, social awareness, etc.

So how else should we insert those topics into the curriculum? My opinion is that social studies and English offer the biggest opportunities for this. They should be a primary topic in social studies, and in English there's a lot of freedom around which literary works/excerpts the kids read and analyze. Why not read accounts of the 1918 pandemic, or works from James Baldwin or Malcolm X exploring racism? I think it's a chance to hit two birds with one stone, learning English and important social topics simultaneously. There's some other specific opportunities, such as topics of investing, economic modeling, and taxes being taught in math classes. Understanding the math there actually helps people make good real world decisions.

Also I do think there's some room for specific, mandatory additional classes to address real world topics without needing to tie them into other curriculum. Even a semester or two for a single year could go a very long way. 

In any case, I think attention should be paid to exactly how the material helps the students both at the district curriculum-setting level and at the school and classroom level. In my experience teachers were evaluated solely on the degree of adherence to district and state standards, and concerns about how it helps the students were minimized or dismissed entirely. They should either address the gaps you mentioned top-down via curriculum (this has been the approach for years and isn't working) or give teachers and individual schools a bit more freedom to think about and implement lessons about what kids really need to know. I think one reason teachers don't do this well is that those above them have conflicting priorities.",2020-10-13 18:37:04

First of all, it's not FOR racists. It's for anyone and everyone - which means that FUTURE generations will benefit because they'll be able to see that racism is bullshit by personally meeting individuals that negate the stereotypes racism teaches. 
Second of all, I'm not shocked to hear that your opinion is racism cant be countered in people it already exists in. You clearly have never heard of Daryl Davis, which based on this exchange doesn't surprise. Davis is a BLACK blues musician who has befriended more than 200 KKK and convinced almost all of those people to give up their robes. Then there's Derek Black, the subject of a book by Eli Saslow (who's won a Pulitzer prize) - Derek's father founded Stormfront and his grandfather was a Gran Wizard in the KKK. Kid went to college and was exposed to opposing views and education about other human beings when his fellow students reached out to him.
There are HUNDREDS of young people coming through community services who are forced to challenge their views, relationships, and friendships even if its through something as simple as a weekly drop in group. Racism is a source of harm, and education THROUGH COMMUNITY is the cure. 

Read a fucking book.

Edit: Just remembered the duo Prussian Blue. Twin singers sometimes referred to as the ""Nazi Pop Twins"" who were pushed by their parents into performing as children for the benefit of white nationalist groups. The girls have denounced their former past claiming they were traumatized by it.

uwwgf9,"Two weeks ago, I arrived at school in the am and hadn’t even made it out of the parking lot when we heard over the loudspeaker, SHELTER IN PLACE! GET TO THE NEAREST CLASSROOM. Kids were running everywhere, falling, confused parents were dropping off kids and I’m urgently telling
Kids to go to the nearest classroom. I had asked a fellow teacher, is this a real one? 

A parent with a newborn and two small kids was getting out of her vehicle and I told her to leave campus because I didn’t know what was going on. Nobody knew. I had to pee and I didn’t want to get trapped in a room peeing in a trash can with fifty scared kids so I proceeded to the staff bathroom. I didn’t hear gunshots, so I took the risk. My boss was welcoming kids on campus- we hadn’t even served breakfast yet- and telling kids to go to the cafeteria. I stayed outside with him, encouraging students to enter the cafeteria instead of proceeding all the way across campus to class. And then my boss forgot to lock our gate, leaving us exposed. 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

It turns out there was a homeless person with a stick about a mile away, and in an abundance of caution, they locked down every school in a two mile radius. 🤦🏻‍♀️ We had injured kids, because they fell or ran into things. I can’t even believe parents were just letting me pull kids from the car and telling them to go to random classrooms. Most scary, bizarre way to start a school day.

uwwgf9,"Does anyone know wtf happened? How did he get inside? I'm reading articles that say he shot his grandmother, got in a shootout with police, crashed his car at the school, and was somehow still able to get inside an elementary school--even with police present. (News saying that the sound of possible gunfire can be heard in the background of that video of the shooter entering the school?)   

There's clearly a lot missing from this story, but if this guy was able to walk into an elementary school in front of police while carrying a rifle--that would be inexcusable.  

Edit: And there it is:  

>Ramos, equipped with a handgun and possibly a rifle, shot his grandmother, who was airlifted to hospital, before entering the school and opening fire, Abbott said.   

>Photos show a pickup truck that crashed outside the school, which, according to Abbott, Ramos abandoned before entering the school.  

>**The 18-year-old engaged in a firefight with border patrol and then ran into the school and barricaded himself, police said.**  

And sadly, the death toll has risen to ~~18~~ 19 children, and 2 adults 💔  😢

fdx3e9,"Shame. I thought she was/is absolutely head and shoulders above the rest of the field in terms of policy, intelligence, clear thinking, detailed knowledge of her brief, an an ability to think quickly and cogently on her feet. Also she doesn't take any shit.
I've wanted Warren as America's first female president since Obama's first term after seeing her go after big pharma, Wall St etc etc. Not in a shouty Bernie way or a not-actually-bothered Biden way, but as someone who will calmly and sensibly get stuff done and make the US a country where inequality and iniquity is rooted out, piece by meticulous piece. 

Anyway.... Seems like after that one black guy somehow managed to get himself elected, America wants to go back to rich old white guy vs rich old white guy.

This is a win for Trump, IMHO. Biden is just Hillary with less hair and less competence but more creepiness. Bernie seems to think being angry for 40 years is all the policy he needs.

Is it too much to ask that the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth is smart and practical and personable and invested in equality? Seems so. Especially if said person doesn't have a cock.
I find identity politics almost totally counterproductive, let alone dull, but it REALLY is about time the US had a female president. And I think you'll have to wait a long time to find a candidate as capable and decent as Elizabeth Warren.

eo45g0,"Ah geeze this is one of my biggest fears every time I drive in crowded places or at night, accidentally hitting someone who is suicidal/endangering themselves with no other way to prevent it.

When I was in high school one of my classmates died because he was playing with friends running back and forth on the highway AT NIGHT. It wasn’t a very busy highway but it was twisty and had a lot of blind turns so deer get hit there constantly. Best spot in the world to play chicken with cars 🙄

Poor woman hit him and killed him instantly. I think about her a lot and hope she is okay. I can’t imagine how much that would fuck someone up, turning a bend in the road after 10:00 PM and hitting a young teen while going 60.

Edit: yes I get it, dash cams are good. Still do nothing to heal any guilt you would feel even if it legally wasn’t your fault. I cry when I hit rabbits in the road. I would be ruined if I hit a person.",2020-01-13 15:57:37

If they said they were mesmerized and believed him etc etc bs etc etc we can all watch some random movie or beliv some friend and say yeah fuck I wanna kill this person, that person don't feel right with me.  U just don't do that cos you're weak or cos you believe some magical guru. U just don't kill people.

Anyway long story short, this is news and let's hope he won't get sensationalized now he's dead cos he was a bad human being to say d least.

haa65t,"I’ve seen this sentiment a lot too over the last few days, so please if you are so incredibly fucking dumb that you are actually wondering why America’s gun culture aren’t commuting into the democrat cities you have banned us from in order to get into gun fights with the National Guard on your behalf, allow me to elaborate. Hypothetical Liberal “Ally” Who Lives in the Suburbs Which Aren’t On Fire – “Hey, gun owners! Here is some civil unrest! Why won’t you come and help us?” Snort. Fuck off. 😀

“Pussies! Why not?” Well, every single gun nut in America has spent their entire adult life being continually mocked, insulted, and belittled by the left. You’ve done nothing but paint us as the bad guys. In Hollywood, we’re always evil, stupid, violent, malicious, redneck, racist, murderers. That’s so ingrained in the liberal religion that when “ally” Harvey Weinstein was trying to get out of being a sleazy rapist, his repentance consisted of promising to make more movies about how the NRA is bad.

In the news, everything is always our fault. If there is a mass murder, we can always count on the vultures to swoop in and blame America’s gun culture. They flog it for weeks on end, 24/7 coverage, hoping for gun control. And if the identity of the shooter doesn’t fit the narrative, it drops off the news in mere hours.

And then at the local, state, and federal level, legally speaking, the left fucks us at every opportunity. You ban everything you can get away with. You ban things that literally make no sense. You ban shit just out of spite. When we fight back against gun control laws, you declare we are stupid because only the police should have guns (hey, aren’t those the guys you are protesting right now?)

“Stupid racist rednecks! We live in a civilized society! Don’t you realize the police will protect us?” until when your democrat cities are on fire, and you call 911 and the operator tells you sorry, the police can’t come to your house right now, please try not to get murdered… How is that strict gun control working out for you?

Then you did everything in your power to chase gun owners out of your sainted liberal strongholds. You passed laws. You banned everything we like. Forced all the shooting ranges to close. Forced most of the gun stores to close. And just generally let us know that our kind is not welcome there.

But now you’ve started some shit, YOU want US to go into democrat cities, with democrat mayors, and democrat police chiefs enforcing democrat policies which cause strife among democrats, in order to get into gun fights on your behalf? How fucking gullible do you think we are? 😀 Like holy shit. Damn dude! Because we all know that literally 30 seconds after a gun nut blows away a government employee on your behalf, then all the national media coverage of the riots will instantly cease (sorta like the Corona Virus coverage did) and it’ll be back to the news breathlessly reporting about right wing extremist gun nuts, and all you useless fucks would go back to whining for more dumb ass gun control. You’ve already thrown the black community under the bus, cheering as their neighborhoods get burned and yours are safe. Seriously, white liberals are the shittiest “allies” in history, and your moral foundation has the consistency of Play-Doh. Your moral compass is a wind sock.

Just a little while ago, gun nuts had a massive peaceful protest in Virginia. Tens of thousands of people turned out to protest gun control proposals from a democrat with a penchant for wearing black face (he still considers himself an “ally” though!) They didn’t break any windows. They didn’t kill any puppies. They didn’t burn any horses. They didn’t flip any police cars or murder any security guards. They were downright boring. They were polite, and even cleaned up their litter. Except then you called them domestic terrorists, and were super sad that they didn’t get massacred by the government (said government you are now mad at for killing people, because again, you fuckers ain’t exactly consistent)

Liberal “allies” are quick to call gun nuts the bad guys, but we’re not trying to disarm people. We want everybody to be able to defend themselves. It’s a common thing to see some meme on the internet, showing a black family shooting or posing with their guns, with some caption like “bet this offends the NRA”, which is liberal projection, because in reality in my social circles everybody is like, “fuck yeah, good for them”. And the harshest complaints I’ve seen have been about trigger finger discipline or lack of eye protection.

My side isn’t the one that wants the state to have a monopoly on force. We know the 2nd is for everybody, regardless of skin color or where you live. You fuckers are the ones who keep declaring we can’t fight the government with AR-15s because they have tanks and nukes, but then you bumbling fuckheads try it by throwing rocks? So not only no, but hell no.

tl;dr: liberals have constantly fought against gun rights, called gun owners dumb rednecks etc, and now are demanding that gun owners stand up for them. the answer is NO",2020-06-17 01:40:20

haa65t,"Why would someone be afraid of anti-fascists if they weren't a fascist? 🤔

Edit: hey y'all. I feel that it'll be easier to post this here than individually to each commenter who is frothing at the mouth. So let me make this clean and clear because people are going nuts for this; 

Fascism -  is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, as well as strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. (Taken from Wikipedia)

Everything we have seen from Trump and his admin are textbook similarities. Maybe not dictatorial *yet* but we have seen the steps leaning this direction with Trump's love for other dictators and their policies (Kim jong-un, Putin). 

We have now seen a major shift in our political climate to blur the lines and make any argument against the president as overreactive. Honestly we haven't reacted enough. On most points during the protests, subsequent riots and lootings, right wing aggressors are the ones to make the leap to violence first. People are angry at the overwhelming amount of police authority and violence which is also a tactic of an authoritarian regime. They are getting help by and helping far right groups all over the nation during these protests. It has become ""Us verses them"". The peaceful protestors can only do so much in the face of actual violence before someone throws a fist back. Antifa, on its many levels of being, is a response to the people being oppressed. It's an uprising and has levels of involvement from plain activism and picketing, to violence. And are you, any of you really surprised at it's creation? We live in one of the best times on earth. Yet we still struggle with basic societal problems that could be fixed easily. So no. I'm not surprised. It was the writing on the wall. Our society has been systematically divided. Now we are seeing the boiling point.

I don't condone violence, but when has a revolution ever been quiet?",2020-06-16 21:33:49

haa65t,"Because ""antifascists"", too busy playing freedom fighters, are quick to call ppl fascists and physically attack them. Life is dull if you don't get that adrenaline fix fighting the dragons. Their behaviour
is very similar to the brownshirts in Germany. 
In this country we still respect free speech even if, and especially if your opponent is a nut job.  
Why doesn't antifa hold public debates and explain why the people they call fascists are wrong? Do they not have the superior position? Are they incapable of
explaining their views to the public? Are they unable to persuse others?
Seems to me if you are against fascism, you should exemplify Democratic sensibilities. If you can't act in a Democratic manner, you're the fascist.

People have linked and expected me to read a multipage analysis on twitter that's broken into 30-40 tweets with highlights thrown in.

Somehow I am the odd one for refusing to read it in that form.

1.**This same exact thing happened to me - went in at 8 weeks, baby had heartbeat. Went for another ultrasound a week later b/c i didnt like the first dr. Thats when i got the news ""sorry, no heartbeat"". I was shocked. I asked what happens now & she gave me options. I asked if i could wait a few days & get a more thorough u/s just to be sure. She said of course! So, went for a third & was confirmed no heartbeat. I asked my options - could i just let it pass naturally or would i need a dnc? Dr said i could try to pass naturally but its not recommended & chances are i'd need surgery either way. So i got the dnc. I walked around with a dead fetus for 2 weeks. Did it make me sad? Of course. 
2.**This lady is crying saying ""i wont be a mother"". WTAF!! She has a kid already!!! Thats what pisses me off! I dont have kids. That was my first & only pregnancy. I cannot have kids now as i am too old.

Our position is based on the right to life and human dignity. We don’t support a woman carrying a dead child, therefore you could simply propose a non-partisan solution instead of trying to imply this somehow undermines the pro-life position, or proves “you need to support the killing of a healthy baby, because in this extreme example that accounts for a minority of a minority of ‘abortions’ wherein the baby is already dead a woman couldn’t have her child removed immediately” Also, an abortion is a termination of a pregnancy, this procedure would not be an abortion, language matters, especially in cases such as this. 

As far as I, and the vast vast majority of those who share my position (I can’t speak for everyone), am aware, this procedure should happen as quickly as possible, and the child should be removed with the upmost care and dignity. 

I take issue with the murder of the innocent, not the removal of a child who has passed, however tragic it may be. Leaving a child who has passed in their mothers womb is an attack on the dignity of both the mother and child.

mnf41a,"Dude had some great things to say he will be missed for sure:

""British women can't cook,"" he told the Scottish Womens' Institute in 1961. .

 ""It looks like the kind of thing my daughter would bring back from her school art lessons,"" he muttered while being shown Ethiopian art in 1965.

 ""I would like to go to Russia very much, although the bastards murdered half my family,"" at a very heated period of history in 1967.

 ""What do you gargle with? Pebbles?"" he told singer Tom Jones at the 1969 Royal Variety Performance. Later he added: ""It's difficult to see how it’s possible to become immensely valuable by singing what are the most hideous songs.""

 ""We don’t come here for our health. We can think of other ways of enjoying ourselves,"" he told journalists in Canada in 1976.

 ""You are a woman, aren't you?"" he said to a Kenyan woman, who was presenting him with a small gift in 1984.

 ""If you stay here much longer you will all be slitty-eyed,"" the Prince told British exchange students who lived in Xian in 1986. When asked on his opinion of Beijing, he replied: ""Ghastly.""

 ""If it has four legs and it is not a chair, if it has two wings and flies but is not an aeroplane, and if it swims and it is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it."" Again with the Chinese insults, when he addressed a World Wildlife Fund meeting in 1986.

 ""I don't think a prostitute is more moral than a wife, but they are doing the same thing,"" when dismissing claims those who slaughter for meat have greater moral authority than those who partake in blood sports in 1988.

 ""Oh no, I might catch some ghastly disease,"" when asked if he wanted to pet a koala in Australia back in 1992.

 ""You can't have been here that long — you haven't got a pot belly,"" he told a British tourist during a visit to Budapest in 1993.

 ""Aren't most of you descended from pirates?,"" he enquired to an islander while in the Cayman Islands in 1994.

He was lecturing at a university near where I grew up, so my parents took me there and I had the privilege of getting to meet him afterwards. On some notebook paper, I had written a short story to give to him and illustrated it. While I’m sure it wasn’t great by any scholarly or artistic means since I was a kid, he was appreciative and later mailed me a card—telling me that I was a great writer and artist.
I’m now 21 years old, and I wish I could tell him that I’ve gained a degree in art, gone on to win awards for my drawings, and have almost completed a trilogy of books. I’ve never forgotten how special and talented he made me feel. May he rest in peace while his legacy lives on in the beautiful things he created ❤️",2021-05-27 04:25:59

She couldn’t get out of bed and her speech was so slow, it was scary as hell for all of us that she would never recover, like one word every 3 seconds. Her health insurance through the school will likely cover most but last I heard, she wasn’t even going to be paid for the time she was out. Gross..fucking..negligence. This was her first teaching job after getting her master’s and she got COVID first day and ooh my family is just so angry at the school for being so reckless.",2020-09-17 20:25:47
iuox0f,God I hate this country sometimes 🤦‍♂️,2020-09-17 21:19:25
iuox0f,"Right. People will say things like “you shouldn’t have kids if you don’t have a plan for them out of school.” But that’s a very casual and ignorant comment. Children are required by law to attend school. Most people have it arranged (even the selection of their jobs, commuting time, etc etc) to accommodate this LAW. So now, when the government changes it, you have to figure things out. Even prior to Covid, most jobs are not supportive of childcare issues. It’s not necessarily a protected class. In Nyc, there is a “caregiver” protected class, but that is not applicable for regular childcare protection, but rather caregiver status for chronically ill people. 

So, parents become desperate because it is also super stringent - childcare tends to end RIGHT when a person ends work, or shortly thereafter and they must race to afterschool because if late, they will be charged extra, shamed or the kids themselves turn against the parents “dang mom, you’re always late.” Because that’s what I need from my kid. To feel like a bum because my boss wouldn’t let me leave 5 minutes earlier🙄

Anyway, I don’t really suffer with this anymore because I have a good job now, but sometimes you send them in because the other option may very well be that you lose your job.",2020-09-17 21:32:09

My school isn’t fucking around with Covid though, which I appreciate.  Your kid has a cough?  A slight fever?  Feeling fatigued?  They’re not allowed back on campus until they get a negative test result, bye.",2020-09-17 23:33:28

I’m divorced and haven’t needed a membership, (my nearest Walmart gives me panic attacks in the parking lot alone). It’s our oldest original Walmart that’s desperately in need of a make over. 

I do most of my big shopping on Walmart.com and have used their delivery or pickup, but it’s so sub par to Target, Aldi’s, and our local grocery store’s. It’s really not worth the aggravation of waiting for, and then getting the wrong delivery or partial delivery time after time, especially when tipping well only to have 3 different delivery people for one order, (kinda screws up the tipping concept on line), and tipping in person only to learn your order is so wrong 😑 
Then to go on line to report what you’re missing from your order to get a refund, and those missing items, are usually coordinated with the other items to make specific meals! It’s a huge cluster F*+K!! 

Ends up being more of a pain in the butt than making a list and driving to the store, which I’ve needed to NOT do for anxiety issues!

My Costco membership is always active. Well worth occasionally playing hide and seek for items I purchased the day before... or falling in love with a product that isn't coming back and costs triple elsewhere.... 😮‍💨

9isnux,"Similar thing happened to me last year.

Look, I have a very forgiving late work policy: anytime before the start of finals week. I tell the kids day 1 that if they TRY (see: turn things in) they will pass. Period.

Still I have kids turn in nothing. They fail. The students understand. NONE of the failing students OR their parents complain.

Get called into the AP's office and asked what's wrong. Told that I should grade incomplete essays as if they were complete (if that ONE paragraph they wrote is awesome, give them 100%). I refuse, stating that if u do that what does that teach the kids doing the work?

End of the year I am non-renewed (fired) without reason or cause. Because they can do that anytime before you sign your fourth contract. Three year probationary period. But why do teachers leave the profession? 🤷‍♂️",2018-09-25 20:39:38
9isnux,"Ugh. I encountered this when doing my student teaching. The school administrators showed a bunch of videos about being compassionate teachers and how giving a zero for incomplete work is inaccurate because “The grade should reflect how well the student grasped the material. If they didn’t hand in any work, you can’t actually evaluate that whether or not they understand zero percent.” 🙄 I understand the mentality and there was a point at which you could just give an I (incomplete) as a failing mark, but it was only if the VAST majority of work was not done. Some of the brighter students were doing like 1 out of 5 assignments in a unit because they grasped that if they got an A on the first assignment they could keep that average up by not risking turning in other assignments.

This whole thing was a huge part of the reason I decided to get my middle school certification. Fortunately I haven’t found this attitude to be as prevalent at middle schools, but I just couldn’t deal with high schools forbidding zeroes. I can’t pretend a 17 or 18 year old is a child and show them no consequences for missed work.",2018-09-25 16:36:52

You, and others, trying to make these actions as normal or NOT doing these stupid things as some sort of life achievement is a laugh.  
So taking a shooting stance on one knee and pointing something that could look like a gun at police is just doing something that ""could be interpreted as negative by the police""?

I call it suicide by cop.

Driving drunk and fighting with the police is doing something that ""could be interpreted as negative by the police""?

I call it putting an officers life, as well as the drunken idiots life in danger

Sorry to be so ""negative"" but I can't reduce these shootings down to a simple misinterpretation nor can I accept that not attacking police should be rewarded.

You don't just get a vaccine for yourself, you do it for everybody else too. It is the only reason you should need to hear, nothing left to discuss.

You think you have some clearly virtuous reason, undoubtedly. You have absolutely no legitimate reason to not get a vaccine unless your doctor says otherwise for you specifically. No one is going to ""have a conversation"" with someone who already mistakenly made up their mind to ignore science, clearly doesn't care about themselves either, and wants to start a fight about it. No, instead, most of us pro-vax are going to tell you off and split. So i'm not offering a conversation, you don't deserve one.

Being black in America has always brought a level of ‘acceptable’ violence and stereotyping by the public, but it is heartening to see people from other countries acknowledging our pleas.

This sort of violence should never be acceptable, nor should we look at such violence as a form of ‘justice’.

Go to Lds.org and put in your address and call the bishop. A group of Mormons will come by and move your shit for FREE. 

Hurricane Katrina? Natural Disasters? They’re there. 

Whose gung ho about stock piling a shit ton of non-perishable foods in the event of an emergency, Mormons. 

Are you struggling to make ends meet? Is affording food an issue? Do you not buy food so that you can afford your bills? 

Call the bishop. Someone will hook up with food. No questions asked. Don’t be afraid to ask for help, they will not forsake and abandon you. 

Are you uneducated? Do you want to work and want to find a trade? 

They will teach you trades. Want to go to college? 

They will show you the steps on how to go to college. 

Doctrine aside. We’re all about uplifted and empowering people to become self reliant. To work hard and provide for your family. To be a devoted husband and respect your wife. To *gasp* be a good mother and love your children. 

To do right by others. 

You are judged by your actions and what you do to others. 

Consistently, we go out of our to help others because we genuinely care about people. 

Don’t Dog the church because you don’t agree with its Doctrine and it’s stockpile of money. They actually do good, lots of good in the community.

gwyimo,"Get out of here with your muddied rhetoric. Unions as a whole are highly positive and NONE have the type of power and corruption that police unions do. They are thier own beast entirely. They just use the label union in place of gang. 

It's funny you mention 2A. Where are all the 2A fanatics right now. Isn't this the exact reason they all said we needed those guns. Seems like they might need to put up or finally shut up. 🤷🏾‍♂️

Don't get me wrong. 2A is important and so is thorough and safe gun control. They aren't exclusive. But there is a deep resonating irony when all those loud asses are nowhere to be seen when the time they claim would come is at our doorstep and they are hiding in thier basements ferociously agreeing with this horrible display of authoritarianism.",2020-06-05 09:23:16
gwyimo,"Or they want to make sure they are properly represented and aren't subject to the whims of individuals making poor decisions about thier jobs regardless of it being a private or public sector. 🤷‍♂️

Even local and state governments can take advantage of thier employees. Teacher unions are actually a prime example of this. They are highly underpaid and under valued and what little movement that has occured to correct this has been because of teacher unions. 

Unions are fine man. The police unions are just a completely different beast from the rest because of the power the members have been given. 

The rhetoric you have been force fed over the years while being a cog in the machine have twisted you to what unions actually are. Can some be crappy? Sure. But without them we would not be anywhere near what we are with things like OSHA, child labor laws, overtime and minimum wages. Those things would not likely exist without labor unions. 

Your fear of unions is a manufactured one that has been pushed by corporations and thier backers. They are becoming more obsolete now and better structures to house collective bargaining are needed but that is a far cry from.saying unions are bad.",2020-06-05 14:50:15

h02ira,"My father and his brothers were stolen from their family, residential schools, and adopted out to white families.

This was in the 50's.

We still get treated like absolute shit by the government, in 2020.

Disenrolled. Federally UN-recognized. Women raped, murdered, or trafficked. Murders of Natives by non-Natives that never even get investigated much less solved. Land polluted, stolen, or destroyed. Oil companies getting the right to do what they want not just with our lands, but our burial grounds and remains of our ancestors, just bulldozed. Bulldozed, right in front of us. Body bags sent to us during Covid, instead of medical supplies. Relief funds being manipulated like a m o t h e r f u c k e r. On and on.

Sad thing is, I was so fucking proud of the U.S. when I was younger! The families that adopted my father and his brothers were all separately pretty good families. We're talking successful farmers, union leaders, and generals. The literal Norman Rockwell type situations. Americana personified. Military families holding records for the most number of brothers serving at the same time. An admiral famous for his Pacific theater actions. A honest to God Nazi Hunter in another family. One of the engineers who had a heavy hand in the Voyager missions, amongst many other NASA history-makers. Hell, my adopted grandparents were foster parents that took in children from the worst situations imaginable, and helped them adjust, while running a carpenter's union and a nurse's union in their professional lives. Firefighters, police officers, majors in the Army, submariners, nurses, D.O.D. department head staff, engineers, on and on, everyone I grew up around was just killing it.

But my father grew up without knowing his mother's voice. The warmth of his father's hand. The ups and downs of having siblings, and the bonds that form. Never knowing the language that was spoken, in an unbroken line, for thousands of years before colonization, let alone the traditions of our people.

He finally found our family, our Native family, when he was in his 30's, and we were pre-teens. We'd found out at least what tribe we were when we were younger, and then who his brothers were, and then years later, our grandparents. The government fought him tooth and nail even to find out the 'names' of my uncles, but the wall they put up, and paperwork, and just basically a bunch of bullshit, was ridiculous.

But when he finally did get the names, both of my grandparents were both long-dead, as well as a lot of their brothers and sisters, so no great-uncles or aunts for the most part too, except for Grandma Bea (great-aunt on my grandmother's side), who is freaking awesome ❤

My siblings and I were exposed to rez life very young. We traveled up to Canada to visit distant relatives all throughout the Ottawa First-nations territories. Remember how chilly it was, not because 'it's  Canada, duh...' but because the homes were, just, ramshackle. The temp outside was the temp inside, even with a stove burning. No running water. Packs of freaking feral dogs. Just, wow. But, just the same as our rez's down in Michigan. On one hand, we learned our culture, and what makes us Native, and the love of our people. But we also saw how when push came to shove and it mattered, just how very little the government views us as equal human beings, from their policies to their tear gas and their dogs.

Grew up, joined the Marines.

Fucking OOH. RAH. MOTHERFUCKERS, SEMPER FUCKING FI TIL I DIE.

Middle East. Afghanistan. Iraq. Back to Afghanistan. Close-up and personal of how the government gets its way, no fucking matter what, part of it personally, for fucks sake.

Daughter's mom is black. From an amazing family too, from being slaves to politicians and business owners in just a few generations. Great-great-great aunt just passed away, she lived in the Jim Crow era, up to seeing her nephew take his oath of office (my daughter's grandpa). Her grandma is a very successful businessperson, self-made, by your bootstraps type stuff.

But the government still let's both myself and my daughter's mom know, even having the lineages we do, from the families we're from, that neither of us is r e a l l y American. Not when it matters. She gets to see people of her race killed on a regular basis, on the news, on twitter. On YouTube. The news. Facebook. In person.

I get to watch protestors get dogs set on them. Know what pepper spray and tear gas are like, first-hand. Get hit with clubs, and taken into custody, and given a ""Starlight Tour"", just because we were protecting our land, fought and died for by our ancestors, for generations untold, and one of the only non-ceded tribal lands in this country.

And now 2020.

Fuck em all, burn. This. Bitch. DOWN.

Our system is sick. It's not broken, well, it is, but at its core, it's disgusting.

It's all take take take take take, with so little give-back, that I don't see how anyone really ever thought it was sustainable. We're seeing the effects of unchecked greed and corruption, and just straight up dishonesty,  firsthand, streaming and live, tweet after tweet.

I don't want the U.S. to fall apart, I really dont.

I have children. Nieces and nephews. My sister just became a grandma not too long ago. I don't want them to live in a country like some of the places I've been to and seen close up. I want us to be a just, proud, and FAIR nation, like we're brought up to believe we are when we're kids in school. I want that so bad for my fellow Americans, fuck, bad enough to put my ass on the line.

But I also don't want to be afraid for my kids, just because they're not White.

But yeah, they did let us pray at pow-wows, and I got to see my aunts get the right to vote, so I've seen a few changes, too, right?

Man. Our country. Great and Terrible.",2020-06-10 09:54:43

Not true, actually. 

dog whis·tle
noun

a subtly aimed political message which is intended for, and can only be understood by, a particular group.

>that doesn't suddenly mean anytime a racist uses it they mean to signify white supremacy in using the gesture.

No, but that isn't proof that NO racists will eventually use it unironically. You're the dissenting opinion stating that it isn't a dogwhistle, so where is your proof that it isn't?

That said, I don't have much direct proof on me since most of the hate subs on reddit got wiped out. Clown World was a really obvious one, using 🤡 🌎 to signal racist ideology. It's also pretty easy to see when people use 👌and (((()))) together.

No one is saying using 👌is racist. Pretending that every 4chan user is just trolling and not actually being racist is just no true Scotsman. But operating under the guise that it's all some ""troll"" gives actual racists a place to spread hate speech with a platform since it's ""just trolling"". Really convenient that a lot of these people happen to be making edgy racist jokes and memes as a pass time.",2020-06-07 10:59:44

I freaked out, stopped in the middle of a busy road, put on my hazards and dragged this thing hissing and fighting out from under the pedals. I didn’t feel safe getting out of my car on the busy road, so I just picked this giant lizard up and let it ride in my arms, looking out the window like a freaking beagle. I sometimes wonder what other drivers thought as they saw me (a small female) driving down the road with a giant lizard looking out the drivers side window.

qvoevi,"Let's think about this for a second, and introduce some facts into this.

Trump acted horribly on Twitter, some of the worst social behavior ever publicly displayed by an American President. Twitter did not take any action against him until he lied about COVID, they labeled his misinformation. Then after he LOST the election and attempted to organize an overthrow of the Presidency, spread lies about a stolen election, encouraged a mob to storm the Capitol building, and came the closest to a Coup d'etat as anyone ever has in America. HE WAS BANNED by social media platforms, very deservedly. And thank God, because his minions in the Republican party are sticking with his tactics and there is a continuous real threat of political violence. Including death threats against members of the Republican party who dare to hold anyone accountable for Jan 6th. Including death threats against Republicans who voted to pass an Infrastructure bill that creates jobs and spending to help us get out of the pandemic economic damage.

Now we have Joe Biden, who did what exactly? In the eyes of many, is boring, old, and a little too ineffective for this serious moment. Certainly messed up the Afghanistan withdrawal that was planned by Trump and Pompeo. But did end the war finally. And now has jobs growing again, the economy healing. Needs to do more to stop inflation, price gouging, and greed.

How are these men and their circumstances even remotely similar other than being presidents. And how can your grasp of politics be any more juvenile and immature. 🙄",2021-11-17 12:45:52

Yes. Executions do involve a disproportionate amount of people with mental illness. And yes, calling the police when you are non-verbal or having a bipolar episode or any number of other reasons can get you killed. I’m sorry it’s not over 50% so you can get an A on your high school statistics course. There’s the links you were too lazy to look up yourself. 

To the person saying they need proof whether it’s really 51/49 whether a cop would shoot you or help you if you called and were autistic… the fact that the burden of “don’t shoot me when I’m calling for your help” needs to be a fucking coin flip to have validity to you shows why this person needs us neighbors looking out more than they need the police.

They were reliant upon food imports, largely from Egypt.  They would and did fight ferocious wars over protecting their control of the Nile delta food supply.

But that goes for many things.  Roman's had pretty advanced metallurgy for their time, and produced what were essentially cutting edge, technologically advanced metal alloys for a wide range of uses (beyond the most obvious armor/swords, which were of course vital)... but they had to source those metals from exotic locations from all across the known world.   

That's why, for example, they spent several hundred years traveling beyond the edge of the civilized world, to the ancient, mysterious, and cursed untamed wild Islands beyond the brutal northern sea, some felt beyond the edge of the world itself... and struggled to pacify the evil druidic creatures that occupied.. well, what would eventually be Britain 😄.

Every fucking election. There it is. Abortion. Taking time from actually important issues. Shit smeared all over the news. Wasting debate time. 

Stop being party to it. Someone wants to talk about abortion? Tell them to fuck off and ask them questions about healthcare. Shush them like the distracting bug they are and just start talking about alternative energy. National parks and fracking. The future of our 'clean' water sources. Displacement, illness and rising insurance and housing costs in the face of global climate change.


Anything but abortion. Fucking stop playing their game. Abortion is not an issue. We are done with it. Get over it. Let doctors decide on their own if they want to perform it. 

There is nothing left to talk about concerning abortion. It is up to us to stop letting lazy asshole politicians and journalists distract us from important issues with shit like abortion, praying in schools, who pees in what room, 'they took err jerbs' . . . Whatever the hot take of the week is. 

It is up to us to have a different election season. It is up to us to force politicians to talk about what we want or get out.

If a 14 year old gets raped not only has she been violated once, she’s going to violated again because some bloke decided that unless their life is in danger they don’t care. What about the 9 months of extreme pain or debilitating financial burdens that come along with having a child? Much like a prolifer, I believe in protecting the child—when she’s being forced to have a baby at 14 because a condom broke, or because someone decided rape her. Just because you give consent to sex does not mean you give consent to pregnancy. They’re two separate things. And abstinence isn’t a solution, we both know sex is part of a healthy relationship, don’t try to shake it off as something unnecessary, and what about those that work in the sex industry? You’re completely ignoring the collateral damage this would have on sex workers. And adoption isn’t nearly as easy you dismiss it to be. Child welfare information gate way explains in one of their studies how three-quarters of birth mothers still experience feelings of loss 12 to 29 years after placing their newborn up for adoption. On the contrary the vast majority of those that obtain an abortion feel that it is the right decision—even those who experience negative feelings after. It gets much more complicated than this, you see approximately 14,000 newborns are adopted annually in the US through voluntary placement, a number that has remained flat for the past 20 years....whilst in 2011 1.06 million abortions were performed. That’s 1million more children that will end up in the system. You’re kidding yourself if you think that underpaid/overworked foster care is a natural solution to abortion. Because that same foster care currently has more than 400,000 children in federal custody.

* that simultaneously worships the mythology of their nation while absolutely hating it IRL

When I was in high school 30 years ago, there was a list presented to our school board demanding they be removed from our school library (they wanted Agatha Christie removed for violent content 🤣 is the one I remember most). Anyway our librarian did indeed pull all those books…and made a giant display of them right in front with a sign that read ‘books for rebels!’ It was awesome. I read Death on the Nile because of that display.  Edited to add I remembered I also Read The Color Purple from that display too.

To answer some of your questions - 

Happy Juneteenth is an appropriate greeting!

Our country just doesn't like to properly deal with that era of history

It's now being pushed to the forefront because it's a popular thing to do, but getting more recognition is a positive thing imo regardless of true/righteous intentions.

Don’t get me wrong, I was very lucky, but you can be grateful AND traumatized. A good outcome does not trump the negative effects of the traumatic incident. 

My next two weren’t as bad. Had two VBACs. I got better at advocating for myself but I also had to drive over an hour to a nationally renowned hospital just to feel somewhat secure enough to do it again, and I had to doctor shop, heavily, until I found one I could build trust with. Even then, I had some bad panic attacks during labor and I couldn’t connect with my babies throughout my pregnancies. Completely detached myself emotionally because in my mind it could happen again but maybe without the luck bit.

We're a military family. We have ""free"" health care (we do pay a tiny bit, but it's a pittance), guaranteed income, rent is paid.

kofuzo,"This is true only if you're not white. Long dumb story ahead: 

Years back I got pulled over by Pittsburgh's Task Force. I made a wrong turn in the Hill District (the hood) after buying crack and ended up going down a no outlet street. As I turned around, they cut in front of me, and 3 undercover cops rushed out with guns drawn at me. Got me *very* quickly out of my car, found my crack pipe and my ~half gram and handcuffed me. This literally seemed like something out of a movie. Asked me where I got it and I told them I cold copped it up at Bedford Dwellings (notorious project, everybody knows why a white kid like me was up there. [Somebody was just murdered there in November](https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-police-probe-shooting-death-in-bedford-dwellings/)). Of course, that wasn't true (it wasn't cold copping), but I was confident in getting away without snitching. They put me in their car, and told me to point him out. As we were driving they were asking what he looked like. I said he had a white shirt and black sweatpants on (lol). They kept pointing to random dudes asking if that was the guy. ""Nope"". As we went through the main section, the driver started to crack down the tinted windows. Told me if I lied to them, they'd drop me off and let everyone in the projects know I was snitching and ""let them deal with"" me (swear to God lol). Anyways they ended up dropping me back off to my car (couldn't find the guy lol) and they drove off. The one cop had asked the other if he wanted to do the processing work for me and he said no so I got lucky again in life. Allegheny County Jail is known as ACJ aka Alcoholics Crackheads Junkies end up there lol. My bag and pipe were still next to my car so I took it and drove away lol. I was *really* not wanting to go to jail seeing as I was also a junkie then, so ya know, withdrawal in jail isn't fun. It's one of many ridiculous but sad and true stories of my life 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️

My point is that being ""natural"" doesnt mean something is good.  I illustrated that point by giving examples of ""natural"" behavior that EVERYONE can agree is not appropriate in society.  This shows how the label of ""natural"" is meaningless in a conversation about morality.

They deserve it! I remember I had some of the best and coolest teachers in high school who actually cared about teaching us students and really made a difference where I wanted to learn the subjects and made class so much more enjoyable because they had fun teaching the classes. It wasn’t just a job to them, this is what they wanted to do for the rest of their lives and they loved doing it. And I’m sure the Vermilion Parish district has some of these kinds of teachers.

LAFAYETTE, La. — A day after a Louisiana teacher was handcuffed and forcibly removed from a school board meeting for questioning the superintendent's pay raise, the school board received death threats, the board president said Tuesday.

On Monday, the Vermilion Parish (La.) School Board met to approve Superintendent Jerome Puyau's new contract. Deyshia Hargrave disagreed with the board's decision to give him a raise, saying teachers and other employees have not received raises in several years.


At one point, an officer with the Abbeville City (La.) Marshal’s Office approached Hargrave and told her to leave the room. A video showed Hargrave asking why she was being removed. The officer then escorts her out of the room. The video next shows Hargrave in handcuffs on the floor of the hallway, then being brought to a parking lot and placed in a police vehicle.

Hargrave, an English teacher at Rene Rost Middle School, was booked into the Abbeville City Jail on charges of resisting an officer and ""remaining after being forbidden."" She was later released on bond.

School board President Anthony Fontana said Tuesday that the board offices were temporarily locked down after it received death threats from across the world.

Fontana said the threats came from as far away as South America, Australia and England, as well as other U.S. states. The threats were reported to Vermilion Parish law enforcement and the FBI, Fontana said.

Fontana said the officer who arrested Hargrave acted appropriately and that he stands by him “100%.”

“His job is to make sure we have an orderly meeting,” said Fontana. “He knows what the law is. He knows what our policy is. … The officer did exactly what he is supposed to do.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana condemned Hargrave's arrest.

“Deyshia Hargrave’s expulsion from a public meeting and subsequent arrest are unacceptable and raise serious constitutional concerns,"" the ACLU said in a statement. ""The Constitution prohibits the government from punishing or retaliating against people for expressing their views, and the fact that a schoolteacher was arrested at a public meeting of the school board is especially troubling.

""The ACLU of Louisiana will continue to investigate this incident and defend the constitutional rights of all Louisianans. We urge anyone whose rights have been violated to contact us.” 

At least two board members are claiming the board treats women unfairly.

Women have several times been told to leave meetings, while men who speak out have not been removed, board member Laura LeBeouf told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Tuesday.

“When she realized she had to get out, she picked up her purse and walked out,” LeBeouf said. “Women in this parish are not getting the same treatment.”

Fontana disagreed saying he could recall two other times when a person was removed from a board meeting. One of the people is the husband of a board member, he said.

“This is not a women’s issue,” he said.

The Louisiana Association of Educators confirmed via its official Facebook page that Hargrave is a member of the group. Brian Blackwell, the Louisiana Association of Educators attorney, is working closely with Hargrave.

""As an organization that advocates for the dedicated school employees of Louisiana, we firmly denounce the mistreatment of Ms. Hargrave, a loving parent and dedicated teacher serving the students of Vermilion Parish. It is every citizen’s right to speak up for their beliefs. Any action that infringes upon this right is unlawful and unacceptable,"" the group said on its Facebook page. 



Deyshia Hargrave was booked Monday, Jan. 8, 2018, into the Abbeville City (La.) Jail on charges of resisting an officer and ""remaining after being forbidden."" She was later released on bond.

Puyau said Tuesday that his new contract pays him an annual salary of $148,811, which he said would put him at No. 32 out of 69 superintendents in Louisiana in terms of salary.

His previous salary was $110,130, Puyau said. He added that he had not received a raise since being in the job. He was named Vermilion Parish superintendent-elect in July 2012. He took over the position permanently in January 2013.

“I have a serious issue with a superintendent or any person in a position of leadership getting any type of raise,” Hargrave said, according to video of the meeting. “I feel like it’s a slap in the face to all the teachers, cafeteria workers, any other support staff we have.

""We work very hard with very little to maintain the salaries that we have, and as I’ve been teaching the last few years, I’ve seen class sizes grow enormously … I just want to say, I don’t care if the performance targets were met. You’re making our jobs even more difficult and we’re jumping through hoops and we’re continuously meeting those goals.”

Abbeville City prosecutor Isaac Funderburk said Tuesday that he would not press charges against Hargrave.

According to the Louisiana Department of Education, Vermilion Parish teachers made an average of $47,041 per year in 2015-16. The Louisiana average for teachers was $48,462.

Puyau said it has been several years since the parish’s teachers or other employees received a raise.

Puyau said he had been advised not to discuss the meeting itself.

In recent years, Vermilion Parish has consistently been one of Louisiana’s top-rated public school districts. Most recently, the Louisiana Department of Education awarded it an ‘A’ grade and an overall score of 106.3, signaling high academic test scores among many of its students and schools.

However, Puyau’s time as superintendent has not been without question as some board members publicly expressed concern about his management style, staffing, financial decisions and strategic planning. 


Hargrave was not immediately available for comment Tuesday. But several people expressed support for her and her comments on social media.

The company Moderna works exclusively with mRNA (messenger RNA) and the Covid vaccine is without the actual virus. mRNA  medicine uses normal biological processes to express proteins and create the desired therapeutic effect. 

The Moderna vaccine works by sequencing the coronavirus genome, and isolating the spike protein. The spike proteins are the spikes on the outside of the spherical looking virus. (🦠)These attach to healthy cells and inject information from the virus to replicate. 

That isolated spike protein is encoded onto an mRNA carrier and injected into a patient. The body replicates the spike proteins only, and your body reacts as if it were defending against a real coronavirus. When your body sees a real threat, it now knows how to fight it.

Basically your body has a proper immune response without the danger of the actual virus within your body.",2020-11-16 19:26:31

But these 3,000+ breaches are all being attributed to “smugglers,” and I see no backup for that assertion.

t5ujm8,"Lol... well duh! Easy to breach when it was never completely built. Makes me wonder... if the wall had actually been completely built (and not halted the moment the current dementia ridden, lifelong politician panzy, came into office) would it have stopped the nearly 6 MILLION illegals that have come across in the last year?  
No one really knows.  However, with a wall, it would have slowed down some of the traffic.  Thus enabling border patrol  to actually do their job.  Instead, It's a free for all and BP is now so overwhelmed with the influx of people, cartel and drugs, that they've been instructed to just herd them, until the dems send their private buses and planes to disburse the illegals across the country.  All at the taxpayers expense.  
Thanks to moron Joe, all the supplies that were purchased are sitting in piles and piles left to the elements; the contractors that were hired are now without work and any and all work on the border wall was completely stopped.

I live in a border state, I see what is happening and what the mainstream media refuses to show.  Meanwhile, Americans are upset because of the invasion into Ukraine... but they turn a blind eye to the invasion that is rapidly but quietly occurring in their own backyard.  These 6MM plus illegals aren't being vetted; don't have to show any proof of any type of vaccines (measles, mumps, small pox etc) a large percentage are convicted felons, some just dump their kids off, never to be seen again.  It's a true crisis, but now our Pres and his cronies couldn't care less about our border so long as it brings in more votes. 
I never thought the day would come that I ever had to say this... but I am truly in fear of what is to become of America. So all you progressives that wanted all this radical change... lol... you ready? Cuz it's only a matter of time that it's going to get real ugly up in here and the America we've known and loved will no longer be the land of the free.

However your comment has inspired me to leave a response containing my views! In all honesty, you're right, this guy truly isn't a ""Christian"" because he's doing the exact opposite of what Christ teaches. It baffles me that some ""Christians"" have an extremely difficult time acting in the most basic ways Christ tells us to act (loving your neighbor), even though Christ gives us clear examples! As a Christian, I may not always agree with others about what should and shouldn't be considered ""morally correct"", but that doesn't stop me from accepting, loving, and caring for everyone, including those who hold different views than I do. Everyone has free will and can choose how they want to live. It is never my place to judge those who have views in opposition to my own! This is how EVERYONE should behave, no matter what one's beliefs are. All should be treated equal because in reality, at our core, WE ARE ALL HUMAN! However, this shouldn't stop us from discussing these ""hot button topics"", because that is an important part of a very delicate balance! Anyway, it bums me out that the worldview of the Christian religion gets tarnished by these ""wolves in sheep's clothing"" who decide to carry out acts like this.


Anyway, my apologies for the essay of random thoughts! I love each and everyone of you! Continue to be an influence of good in this world (there is way to much toxcicity and hate if you ask me) and never cease to ""love your neighbor"". Have a fantastic day! ❤",2019-06-19 22:14:05

I don't know everything in this world, I have the common sense to know that the government or at least MSM usually doesn't have your best interest at heart. What opened my eyes is they started calling dark pools and synthetic shares ""conspiracy theories"" on news stations.. When these have both been proven to exist in the past, especially dark pools. Both are just used to make the rich more rich and keep the poor/middle class where they are. Which is why 95%+ of retail investors lose money in the market, because of the illegal practices they use. We have slowly been uncovering all of that and it keeps getting labeled as conspiracy theories. God help us.",2021-10-10 20:29:00

This is literally the article:

Tennessee physicians who create or spread COVID-19 vaccine misinformation or disinformation could now face disciplinary action, including suspension or revocation of their medical licenses in the most extreme cases, according to a new policy from the state medical board that oversees doctors.

The policy was adopted by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners — a 12-member board that's appointed by the governor and responsible for disciplining physicians who violate practice standards — at its most recent meeting, on Sept. 21.

""Spreading inaccurate COVID-19 vaccine information contradicts that responsibility threatens to further erode public trust in the medical profession and puts all patients at risk,"" the policy states.",2021-10-10 20:32:30

Obviously, Bernie is not popular with the big corporations. You better believe they were lobbying against him and using their money to oppose him.

Everyone is still elbow to elbow on the lines. They are required to wear masks but they get wet and people take them off. In the beginning they made them wear face shields but they fogged up so the genius management team decided to drill mouth holes in them. It’s comical how stupid they’ve been. They let a man come to work without a test after he’d been on leave in South Korea back when they were struggling with covid (idk whether or not they still are but either way wtf). Just in the last two weeks they let a man work even though his daughter was waiting on test results. My sister had to go to the doctor for a non Covid issue and they let her work all day before meeting her at the time clock to say she needed a doctors note saying she didn’t need a test. These meat companies do not care about their workers and they had to have already calculated that letting workers die will cost less than slowing operations in any way. There has been so much BS with this company but Covid has brought out the worst in them.

You can (or at least could, I'm not 100% sure this is still available) pay for a speed boost that is unlocked via software.

The most reasonable argument I've seen as for why this is something you pay for is that it is making the motors work harder than their standard specs, which could cause additional wear & tear, and so in theory cause additional warranty issues.

That power boost is also not the same as the performance models of the car, which are more powerful, but achieve that power with hardware, not software.

Also, it's been some time since something like this has happened, but when the cars were a bit newer you would sometimes see a slight power/range boost happen with a software update. These were caused by essentially allowing the cars to utilize more power / display more range as testing indicated it could be allowed on current hardware.

esgarl,"People really dont understand what conversion therapy is, so let me give you a little insight;

Had a friend in HS, we will call him ""Nick"" - We were 16, I was out of the closet at my school, he was not (he went to a diff school) - Nicks parents were NOT accepting of homosexuality, in the slightest. Well, one day Nick tells me and some friends his parents found out he likes guys, and they decide to send him to conversion therapy (This is in TN, by the way, back around 2007-ish, if memory serves)

Nick gets sent away to conversion therapy, we do not speak for a LONG time, months and months.

Fast forward, another gay fellow in the friend group comes to me, and said ""Hey did you hear what happened with Nick?"" No, I said so he filled me in- Turns out Nick escaped, because of the torture they were putting him through, mentally and physically. They wouldnt let him eat for the first 42 hours he was there as some like...""detoxing"" ritual. Assigned girls to boys, made them perform physical / sexual intimacy tests in front of the ""therapists""- They strapped him to a chair, and made him watch straight porn for hours on end. This just grazes the surface. According to Nick, this place destroyed his mental wellbeing, and caused him to basically freak the fuck out and run away.

Fast forward a few months after my friend told me the news about Nick's escape...Turns out He ended up killing himself. Got bad on drugs, and just OD'd in the end . This was a kid that didnt even smoke pot when I knew him.

Anyways, until you know someone or have some personal anecdotes about the evil that is conversion therapy, please try to understand no one is trying to encroach on someones right to do what they want with their lives- This kind of thing is honestly brutal, psycho and unnecessary, and ends up causing more pain and sorrow in the end...

b08ile,"As if we needed a further indictment of the way money works in this country 🙄 We are obsessed with the rich and the elite, and have developed structures to keep the rich and elite where they are. The entire education system is supposedly based on merit, but it starts with kids born into the wrong zip code getting a worse shot from the beginning because of tax-based funding. The main reason to go to an elite college is connections rather than the program itself, assuming you’re not doing something super specialized. The system shouldn’t look like this. Your ability to get an education and find quality work shouldn’t be based on who your parents are and what money they have, whether they’re cheating your SATs, lying about your athletic record, or just happened to move to a neighborhood with a good school.

I’m not saying I don’t still struggle. In fact, when I’d see other people telling stories like this of their own personal journey, I never thought it would apply to me. I never thought I’d see the other side of The Darkness.

All pregnant women released from jail (even if, and maybe especially if they got pregnant after they started there time)

This is how you force Floridas hand on “a fetus is a child” issue.

Shiiiiit, this just got me thinking. Assuming Florida favors on behalf of the child being wrongly imprisoned, and the child is somehow released🤷‍♂️ AND they are able to sue for wrongful imprisonment, winning their case, this would open a loophole to get money from the state.

Step 1) Get pregnant

Step 2) Commit a crime that will land you and the unborn child in jail

12fwy21,"Trump is not only a ""threat to democracy"", he also single-handedly caused inflation, forced Biden tp leave $80 Billion in military equipment and hand over the most technologically advanced airfield ever built to the Taliban (just 400 miles west of Chinese ICBM installations), created the crisis at our southern border, killed over 10 billion people with Covid, and now, as of last week, Trump apparently also interefered in the 2016 election through his $130k settlement to a pornstar, which would have resulted in Hillary winning according to Alvin Bragg (wait a second, that sounds a LOT like election denial...)

166h85k,"Yea, again I'm all out of sympathy for someone like Joe Biggs, so 17 years, 30 years, being ""Putined"" and pushed out a window, for me it all falls under an armshrug 🤷‍♂️ and FAFO. For me it's simply a case of too many instances of innocent, or at lest people in difficult positions, get worked over by the system/circumstance, to expend sympathy over any theoretical injustice done to a PoS leader of a hate group attempting to overthrow the government. 

*That said* reddit has this absurdist punishment fetish. Where anything less that like life sentences isn't enough for a whole litany of crimes. The amount of people you're going to dissuade from criming by handing out 17 year sentences, is about the same as what you'd get from handing out 30 year sentences.",2023-08-31 20:46:16
