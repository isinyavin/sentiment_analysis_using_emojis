7wtsuf,"The 2 white actors were in “lord of the rings” which was written by Tolkien. “Tolkien” sounds like “token”. A “token white” is a white person placed into a movie of all black people just so the producers can say there was a white person in the movie so that proves they weren’t discriminating against whites. (The phrase is usually used to mean the reverse....an all white cast with a “token” black. Which is much more commonly done. 😑)

Get it now? It’s a play on words Tolkien/token. ",2018-02-12 01:13:48

7wtsuf,"Where do I even begin with this? 😂

Tbh man, I dislike ethnonationalists in general regardless of race/religion. Nor do I ever claim Anglos were the only ones that did anything of worth in the world. Because they aren't. 

All I meant was that at least the white ones can brag about Europeans creating cars or World Wide Web or quantum mechanics. You can't just claim the achievements of Persians, Europeans or Arabs like that. ""Race"" as a concept didn't even *exist* back then. Romans, Levantine Arabs, Greeks, Anatolians, North Africans all mixed together. 

Greek, Latin and English are all Indo European languages. They didn't spread from Phoenecian (which has Semitic roots). Spanish, Sardinian have Arabic influences and Maltese is Semitic but that's it.

Arabic culture has heavy influence in the Horn of Africa but that works the other way around i.e. Arabs influenced Somalian culture. And Persians/Afghans/Turks have very little to do with Sub Saharan Africa. ",2018-02-12 05:56:21

We would typically use 'ye' where Americans might use 'ya'll'. If i was speaking to one person I would say 'you' and if I was speaking to multiple people I would say 'ye'.

The daughter uses this correctly when talking to the family but I don't think the father should be saying ye when just talking to the daughter. 

Perhaps an easier way to quickly portray an Irish accent in text would be to use 'me' instead of 'my'. Obviously not everyone in Ireland says this but it is definitely believable. E.G: ""I will in me hole"" = ""I will not"". Or ""Me car's over there""

7esyjx,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand net neutrality. The semantics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical IT most of the semantics will go over a typical redditors’s head. There’s also Pai's capitalistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the protocols of the learned elders of zion, for instance. The redditors's understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these semantics, to realise that they’re not just thought provoking- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike net neutrality truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the deepness in Pai's existential catchphrase “heavy handed net neutrality rules are stiffling the internet"", which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Pai's genius wit unfolds itself on their pc screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

Overall, it has been an odd time for me to hear that Americans are rude. They may be ignorant, but I don’t really see them as rude. And I’m sure many Europeans coming to America are also ignorant of many things. Knowing geography isn’t enough to be consider knowledgeable.

Unlike the ones here in the U.S. I lived in Canada for four years and it was incredibly different. People didn’t act like lunatics and cut ties with friends and family members over politics. Many people here on both sides have become so miserable and bitter. Just look at all the thread arguments on here.. In a “Joke” sub of all places. Hell, you were accused of being “the problem” when you’re not even American. LOL ...You are right though, both options are PURE GARBAGE, which is why I couldn’t bring myself to vote. 

I’m a Democrat and I could care less if someone is conservative or liberal. As long as they’re not assholes then who am I to judge? I have friends from both sides. In fact, my Mestizo-Hispanic family consists of both Republicans and Democrats. None of them are far right or far left. None of them fit any of the ridiculous stereotypes that both parties in the U.S. accuse each other of. All of them have voted outside their party many times. All they care about is their family and their career. They have lives. There are a lot of people here in the U.S like that (myself included) and yet we are judged over being conservative or liberal, despite the fact that we are the opposite of said stereotypes and the opposite of what we’re being accused of. It’s pathetic. You sir are lucky.

6fl7jt,">Yes, assuming that their wife/girlfriend is one of the ones who get moody and unpredictable. 

They all become moody and unpredictable. That's how hormones work. It's even scientifically proven that hormones cause emotional issues for women, their brains shrink during pregnancy leading to memory loss and other issues, and postpartum depression is a thing because their dopamine and serotonin regulatory systems go whack, affecting their brain and causing emotional issues.


>And that totally compares to being the one going through it. 🙄 

Yep. Walk a mile in our shoes before you judge. As I said, women forget the issues they face, men don't. The emotional and psychological strain a pregnancy and the following childrearing needs puts on a relationship is again well documented by science and psychotherapists.",2017-06-07 08:08:43

6d2lom,It shouldn't be too bad. My husband has been stuck doing it an idr since 2013. We got married in November of 2016 and it may have screwed us...I worked a lot of overtime for a few months to go on vacation and wasn't expecting to need to get married by the end of 2016. I think I made 25% of our combined income in 3 months. 😬,2017-05-24 20:00:59
6d2lom,"This happened to me a long time ago. I went in because I knew I had a cavity and I finally had some dental insurance, which as you discovered yesterday, doesn't go far sometimes. It was over $12k estimate. This was a decade ago or more. I was making $7.50 an hr. Got 2 fillings and I just tried to forget about the rest. I had a wisdom  tooth that was crooked and it was being worn down. It finally broke over 2 years later. I discovered it really only hurt if I chewed with it so I just used the other side of my mouth. A least 6 more months went by and I had dental insurance again but no health insurance anymore. Decided I'd better get it yanked before it becomes a hospital visit. I went to one of those chain dental places this time. I'm expecting a $15k estimate this time on all this work, being as it's years later. I can't recall how much it was but it seems like it was about $2k less than before. The dentist knew I was broke when he asked me if I wanted to pull the tooth awake or be knocked out. I asked if knocked out costs more.  He yanked the tooth with me awake and he asks me ""do you want to hear about the tooth next to this one today or when you can afford it?"" Or something like that. He was a cool guy. I opted not to hear about but I kinda just had. Maybe 3 months later (not sure anymore) I got a letter in the mail. Same place offering to do all that work for a little over $8k with no insurance. Then I found out about dental schools! Figured I'd get it done even cheaper. That's kind of where the story ends. I never got any of it done. I'm certain it's been over 8 years since I declined to hear about the tooth next to that broken wisdom tooth. I can feel it needs work and I have the money today. Just don't want to waste my time off doing it. So.....shop around. Get a second opinion. Or try a dental school to save cash. Put off some of it if you have to. None of mine have fallen out. None ever hurt. Unless maybe I'm used to it and can't tell anymore. I lot of stuff hurts. You'll see! Also, 40 hours isn't a lot of hours. Anything less than 60 feels like part time or vacation now. One of the many reasons previous generations could buy a house was Overtime pay. Something employers hate to pay these days. They get ya on a salary after you make too much. If you have debts and you're broke then overtime and that dog need to be about your only friends. Friends cost money with all their wanting to eat out and see movies and going to concerts. Your dog just wants nice cheap attention. Keep the dog. Get grocery circulars and buy whatever is cheap. I ate a lot of Walmart brand spaghetti rings and pork & beans. I never missed a bill but I saved electricity and water like crazy for a couple of years and I wore dirty jeans all the time. Washed underwear and socks (sometimes other stuff)in the bathtub with an actual washing board. My mother THOUGHT she was giving it to me as a joke! Sometimes it was my shower water. Showered with the dirty clothes washing them. I could go on all night about the cheap ass way I got by but.... I really just didn't want to see you rack up so much dental debt if you don't have to. My hard times made me who I am today and I like me better now than I liked myself then. You can't put a price on that. Sometimes I go camping just to remember what it was like. 😉 Except my tent doesn't have a leaky roof or black mold. Good luck!

Edit: Holy crap! I didn't realize this was so long! Sorry

a9psdl,"Screw this, people are just overreacting. Joke is a joke, unless it's not very emotionaly conected topic to the person, i wont mind if it may offend someone, cuz his gender is attack ambulance. 

 I fully agree some jokes are really over-offensive, but if someone get's offended by telling a joke about black people (even if black man says this joke) or when woman get's upset cuz blondie says jokes about blondies, and calls it unfair, now tell a joke bout' man, or i will get eternally upset and sue you, you know what? I don't care about such minor pittynes. Joke is a joke, unless it's not intentionally harmfull and very rude or a joke that REALLY shouldn't be told (like about dead family member of someone) i wont really mind.

There are Jokes, Jokes that are offensive to overreacting people, and just jokes about specific topics, kind of dark humour, and just Bad/Rude jokes. As i agree those Rude and Bad jokes should be avoided, tho when someone is just overrreacting and this joke is not even specific for that person... Why to bother?

I come into work one morning and my co-worker says, “Hey did you hear about Noah?” He had the same dark sense of humor as me, so I say, “Oh no what...did he die or something?” He says, “Uhh yeah...actually he did.” 😳

Years later, I made that same dumb joke when a different friend asked me a similar question about someone else. I respond- “oh what, did he die or something” and he said yes also! Wtf, apparently whenever I make that joke the answer will always be yes",2018-12-26 19:21:59

Well it certainly isn't anything to do with your 2nd amendment rights, that's for sure. I'm talking about your own government going rogue in your own country. You won't win with rifles.

>This is besides the fact that nuking your own country is one of the most catastrophically stupid things a government can do, no matter how authoritarian they are. 

That would be pretty tyrannical, wouldn't it?

>Guns aren't just for hunting

No, they're not. They're for competing (no internationally recognized competition I know of uses automatic rifles) and they're for collecting (if it's for show purposes, make them inoperable) and they're for rodent control (again, don't need to use a semi or auto weapon to do that properly).

I own a shotgun that I compete with and I can drop a kangaroo mid bounce, head shot at 300m with a Remington. 223. Haven't come across a show piece automatic rifle tho. 😊",2018-03-18 01:12:44

This was a hard enough process it's self at the time visiting over 5 different shops I finally found one, the excitement was unreal I loved the old battlefront games and from the gameplay trailer I was gagging to play it . 

Then I got the game, if you can call it that. More like a shell of a game with some tutorial-like single player. No galactic conquest, no story no content in general really. 

Graphics and sound wise the game is pushing the boundaries leaving me thoroughly impressed however...... 

The thing that makes EA the worst game company on the planet is the fact they expect me to buy a game twice (£80 - £100 with all DLC) for a game that has half the content of the original battlefront two. 

I felt taken the piss out of and violated.

He’ll go down as the only president in history to be impeached AND re elected, like an absolute boss. The democrats just did us a huge favor, and they’re so stupid that they’re cheering in the streets because they think impeachment means he’s out of office or can’t be re-elected 🤣🤣.

Calling it now, the Dems will not respect the results of the election once he wins in 2020, by a landslide. The house will turn to the red as well and the democrats are going to have a very, VERY angry next four years.

Just a tip, he won’t be removed from office either 😂😂

This whole thing just secured his re election. The only thing the Dems can do now is challenge the vote or the system (cough, you guys have already tried to abolish the electoral college). Funny how you guys LOVED to reference the framers when the Dems called their witnesses in regards to Trump defying all constitutional law by being targeted and spied on illegally for some reason during the impeachment hearings .. but as soon as it comes to the electoral college or the second amendment... the framers were apparently absolutely retarded according to the democrats.. you guys can’t have both .. LOL

Can you see the hypocrisy yet? No? Didn’t think so. This is why people who have lives outside of Reddit think you’re delusional extremists.

ecmd58,"Because no criminal activity has occurred. Those two articles of impeachment aren’t crimes. They’re basically saying “we’re impeaching because we don’t like him”. They *tried* to impeach him three times over actual
Criminal activity, obstructing justice.. bribery.. collusion.. but they couldn’t because there’s no evidence. Don’t believe me? Just look at the articles 🤣.

That’s why this entire situation is so dangerous, why the democrats are so obviously corrupt and partisan, and have planned this since before Trump was in office. There are certainly people in government that are going to lose their seats next cycle, but they’re all going to have blue ties. The public isn’t as dumb and egregiously impressionable as the delusional children on Reddit. 

Nancy Pelosi said this in the last two days..

>it would be dangerous to leave the vote in the public’s hands to determine whether or not Trump can stay in office 

Ie - “I have the power, not you. The people of the United States mean nothing, and *we know better than you do*, so we’re calling the shots.. we don’t represent *you* at all”.

If you aren’t absolutely DISGUSTED by this woman by now, you need to leave the fucking country, full stop. Politicians represent US, not the other way around. That’s what makes America so GREAT.

jaartk,"Bahaha you have no fucking clue what you’re talking about and you’re insisting on it.  And you’re tossing insults out as well, as if that strengthens your argument.  I provided examples and you’re ignoring those and still misunderstanding proportional increases.  Maybe you’re entitled to your own facts?

Keep thinking a cube that doubles in size is really eight times larger because you learned middle school math.

Here let me help you understand proportions.  What if a 2x2x2 cube doubled in size?  Would it be 4x4x4?  Or 2.5x2.5x2.5?  By your logic, is going from a volume of 8 to a volume of 64 also doubling in size, or increasing in size by a factor of 8?

Edit: Lmao your edit.  Yes I downvoted you because you were incorrect and then corrected you.  Is that a Reddit faux pas or are you gatekeeping the correct way to respond in Reddit like you’re gatekeeping your fool’s math?  The irony, of course, is that you downvoted both of my comments before responding.  Hypocritical and bad at math, good luck with that personality 🤣",2020-10-13 17:30:08

One of the husbands in the big group decided this was the time to make a joke so he said ""dont mention the war 😄!""

so he kept saying it one more time but still no reaction.

I think he said it at least 5 times more. It was quite sad to see him try so hard and everyone ignoring him. From what I can recall his wife didnt even laugh.

But just in case you are still confused, here is a good rule to know if calling someone a Jew is racist. 

Are you saying, ""My best friend is a Jew, so he taught me all about passover."" ✔️That's perfect! Totally fine to say.

Are you saying, ""I hope that Jew and the rest of his ancestors die out because their religion is the reason girls get period cramps and why I have no friends! Plus, they smell."" ❌ Less good to say, so you should probably ask the Jew and his ancestors first to make sure they're cool with that.

7d9mr6,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand microtransactions. The intent is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Austrian economics most of the money will fly right out of a typical gamer’s wallet. There’s also EA’s opportunistic scheming, which is deftly woven into its monetization- its corporate philosophy draws heavily from Hobbesian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the sense of pride and accomplishment, to realize that they’re not just looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis- they say something deep about challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and OF COURSE attainable via GAMEPLAY.

As a consequence, people who dislike Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 truly ARE armchair developers- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in EA’s existential catchphrase “It's In The Game,” which itself is an ironic reference to Norah McClintock’s young adult novel Truth And Lies. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated nerf herders providing candid feedback in earnest as EA’s avarice unfolds itself on their computer screens. What sheep.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the Twi'leks’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 60,000 credits of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

>To those who say that comparisons of Trump’s presidency to Nazi Germany are hyperbolic, I say try telling that to the mothers whose infants have been torn from their arms. A president responsible for such an atrocity exposes a level of cruelty that has no limits. None. Trump has already told us that for him there is little difference between the neo­-Nazis in Charlottesville and the Americans who took to the streets to condemn their bigotry.

8ysy3a,"Down the rabbit hole I go.

Guys this is serious. I won’t link the post, but the guy with the video driving around is clearly developing schizophrenia. 

Look at the way he draws absurd and nonsensical connections to the most trivial events, then uses those absurd points to launch into even more absurdities. 

Cop in the parking lot?! Cop at the GAS STATION?! The alarm stopped AS I LEFT THE PARKING LOT! Can’t EXPLAIN THAT! Time travel! 9/11!!!! 

This man clearly needs help before he hurts himself or someone else.

Edit: side note, one idea on why early humans were so successful is our large brains exceptional pattern recognition. Pattern recognition leads to insight which leads to exploitation of that insight (technology). It’s interesting to see first hand what appears to be our pattern recognition neural net going haywire, locking on to anything dominant in the heap and linking it with non-causal events.

8ysy3a,"> skeptical - not easily convinced; having doubts or reservations

Naw I think skeptical is the correct word 😊 Always be skeptical of what you put into your body, especially what goes into the bloodstream 😊

> that those who DO have that knowledge 

And those that DO have knowledge also say the official story is not what happened 😉

6cyu9p,"The Federal Government of Australia calls it an immunisation schedule because it immunises people from preventable diseases. I strongly doubt that the scientific and medical community (and their unions) would let the government get away with calling it such if it didn't make people immune to things like polio and meningococcal. 

Considering the government bars unvaccinated children from preschools and IIRC reduces the amount of monetary assistance given to parents who don't vaccinate their kids, I doubt they're mandating schools adhere to their part of the immunisation schedule for funsies. 

There's a girl in my grade whose parents who actually think that vaccinations give people autism, and I've honestly lost count of the amount of sick days she's had off school compared to everyone else who has been vaccinated. And when she DOES come back to school with remnants of whatever disease she got, mysteriously nobody else gets it. 

I don't really buy your comment, which is why I call bullshit, but if you've got proof that I'm wrong and you're right, I'll stand corrected 😊",2017-05-24 07:59:45

The charged up part .. dems spent 4 years throwing a tantrum, threatening to impeach him the day after he won, urging people to walk up to and start harassing his cabinet members, and twisted everything he said or did to be something it wasn't. He could have been taking a shit and pelosi and cnn would claim he was flushing cocaine down the toilet to hide it from Hunter .. whoops, I mean. But the Dems literally spent 4 years making a mockery of the US Presidency and Congress. In their efforts to cut down trump, what the outside world saw was The Greatest Country In the World's government intentionally obstructing itself and non stop criticism and CNN's fake news. Yes, alot of it was verifiably fake. Admitted even by the CEO after Biden took office, that they intentionally attacked and twisted things regarding Trump because it was ""for entertainment."" CNN almost got cancelled at one point, before the Dems really turned the polarization of Dems against Republicans up to 11. One of Biden's big campaign promises was to depolarize the country and make peace between the parties. Then he immediately renigged on that the day after inauguration, and accentuated it with the first bill he past. Thankfully, Manchin opposed the idea of rushing through bills, spending money and passing agendas without the Dems even taking the time to read them, while being unable to present a plausible plan for repaying the money spent by those bills. Then there's the issue that a lot of conservatives have with Dems in Congress using Jan 6 riot as a political tool to hang on all republicans, making it out to be the worst and most violent thing to happen in this country since the civil war. It was the republicans who fought and won that war, btw. Lincoln was the first republican president. But that claim is not at all true. The summer of 2020, cities across America were being burned and looted and riots were everywhere. While the Dems took a knee and justified it. Our VP having donated money to a non profit that was bailing out the rioters who, guess what, went back out and started rioting again. At least one of them killing someone. Multiple cops were shot doing their jobs. Some fucktard even went on Facebook live to show him killing someone during the riots. Democratic Washington state allowed a section of Seattle to claim to be a sovereign nation, without bringing national guard to retake it. Instead they tried to make emergency services and paramedics look bad for not entering this sovereign nation, where they were afforded no protection and had a lesser chance of getting out alive than not making it out, because if the patient died, they were going to probably get beat to death by the group. Meanwhile, down in Democratic Oregon, looting, rioting, and burning went on for over 100 days without being stopped. Far worse damage, far more deaths, far worse offenses occurred during those riots than anything that happened on January 6th. But not a single Democrat was held accountable or investigated. I don't support the Jan 6 riot but it also wasn't done by Republicans. It was a small extremist faction, and still was overshadowed by the amount of rioters Summer 2020. All of these things and more, are examples of how Dems used Trump to polarize this nation to the point of actually suggesting and supporting hate crimes against Republicans just for being Republican. Most Dems I've run into that push the most hate, don't have a clue why they are doing it. Meanwhile the actually Republicans, not the extremist Trump stans, constantly take shit and get attacked by the same people who polarized this country and bred an army of Trump haters who actually have no idea why they even hate him. Most libs can't actually give reasons of factual details for the hatred for Trump. But they are usually the ones running around the internet making fun of trump or Republicans, posting and making memes about him, or making fun of him or Republicans in some way. Complete fucking idiots who jumped on a trend.

So thats why some of aren't open-armed about jokes, even innocent ones, about Trump. When the trend of encouraging hatred took off, it wasn't just directed at Trump. It was directed at every right leaning person in this country. Most liberals can't even tell you what Republican beliefs and policies are. Our country fucked itself big time, created polarizing tensions and threw public tantrums to show resistance and disrespect to Trump for 4 years. Before he even took office.

Most intelligent people know, governments are like parenting. If mom said no, dad needs to say no. Mom and dad can talk about it privately if one disagrees, but not in front of the kids, and whatever rule is enforced, it's enforced mutually. There's a power in unity. People tend to think that the rest of the world just laughed at Trump, too. Except they weren't. They were laughing at us. Our first world fights over pronouns and preventing the sexualization of kids as young as K. Notice that Biden has basically accomplished nothing, globally. Iran and north Korea opening laugh and mock him. Even mexico doesn't respect him. or us. That happens when one party of government decides to very publicly and very childishly show a total disrespect for the highest office, and actively works to destabilize the country over it.

But wait, this is joke reddit.

Its not about wanting free time. Its about not being exploited in our current system, not wanting to work for employers who are self-serving, and expecting that work=stability with an emphasis on having and maintaining a personal life.

Currently we are defined by our occupation that determines whether you'll be in poverty or not (your occupation=life or death).  We think humans have inherit value that the dollar cant properly represent.  In a country (the US) that has such excessive means of not only production, but population - *no one* should be in poverty.

7dylhe,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand microtransactions. The intent is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Austrian economics most of the money will fly right out of a typical gamer’s wallet. There’s also EA’s opportunistic scheming, which is deftly woven into its monetization- its corporate philosophy draws heavily from Hobbesian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the sense of pride and accomplishment, to realize that they’re not just looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis- they say something deep about challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and OF COURSE attainable via GAMEPLAY. 

As a consequence, people who dislike Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 truly ARE armchair developers- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in EA’s existential catchphrase “It's In The Game,” which itself is an ironic reference to Norah McClintock’s young adult novel Truth And Lies. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated nerf herders providing candid feedback in earnest as EA’s avarice unfolds itself on their computer screens. What sheep.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the Twi'leks’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 60,000 credits of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

7dylhe,"My boyfriend and I were driving home from a friend's house who we went to visit this weekend. Had a good time staying up doing fun friend productive things. He hadn't seen his best friend in a long time so we needed up staying up for a little over 24 hours. I took a nap because the drive home was an hour and a half drive and I felt that I needed to stay alert for that (obviously). Anyway, we were hungry and decided to get something from Whataburger (yay Texas) near the apartment. We had initially attempted Jack in the Box to avoid the typically full lines at Whataburger (even at 4 am 🙄) but their systems were down. Anyway it was in the Whataburger line that I started to feel tired so I thought reading might help me fight it off since I get invested in whatever I'm reading and Reddit is full of small dopamine bursts of random reads and links. I get to this joke and start it. Maybe a couple of times course I kept losing my spot every time that I looked up to check if the line had moved. They're fairly quick even though they were 8 cars deep when we got there so we ended up at home by 4:30? 4:50? So here I am around 5:15 AM done eating and ready for bed cause I've got work at 1 PM and I just wanna sleep. I think I managed 30 hours of fun on 6 hours of sleep and was just physically ready to knock out. Of course, as is the case often enough, I get in and I'm unable to sleep. Mind is going just enough that I can't actually pass out like I had hoped. So I pull up the Reddit app and remember I was reading this long joke that had been upvoted so clearly the punchline is worth it. As I'm reading and trying to guess what could possibly be the punchline I end up falling asleep. I wake up today with a little extra time before having to get ready for work so I pull up the app again only to remember I was reading this joke but nothing about it. So here I am re-reading it for probably the 4th or 5th time, all this fucking time invested and I finally get to finish it only to be EA rick rolled. No. Sense. Of. Accomplishment. At all. All pride gone. ",2017-11-19 17:54:36

My dumbest friend who can't pass highschool math or English buys lootcrates, whole other friends who are studying game design as I do and I would say are very smart do not buy them. I'm not saying dumb people play Battle in North 2, but rather not all Smart people play the game and all people playing are not smart.

You can not say someone is smart based on the games that they play. No matter the game. It can be Kerbal Space Program by Squad and the person playing can be dumb. I don't play this game. Not because I have other games I like and prefer not to play on the PC.

Also to say ""As a consequence people who dislike Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 truly ARE armchair developers"" shows you are a developer of a lower status. To pass judgement on those who do not have similar interest is one of the qualities of armchair developers. ",2017-11-19 13:34:11

7ddhei,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand microtransactions. The intent is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Austrian economics most of the money will fly right out of a typical gamer’s wallet. There’s also EA’s opportunistic scheming, which is deftly woven into its monetization- its corporate philosophy draws heavily from Hobbesian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the sense of pride and accomplishment, to realize that they’re not just looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis- they say something deep about challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and OF COURSE attainable via GAMEPLAY.

As a consequence, people who dislike Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 truly ARE armchair developers- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in EA’s existential catchphrase “It's In The Game,” which itself is an ironic reference to Norah McClintock’s young adult novel Truth And Lies. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated nerf herders providing candid feedback in earnest as EA’s avarice unfolds itself on their computer screens. What sheep.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the Twi'leks’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 60,000 credits of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Yes the comparison you draw is kinda true but they are publishers in the same vein as EvilArts™. Sooner or later they will devolve to the same crap.

The thing is, she’s right...
Problem is that lots of men equate their value with the size of their cock, their ability to perform, and the endurance they possess. 
I’m not saying it doesn’t matter cause we love sex too, but your value lies in how you make her feel. 
The size doesn’t really matter, but please, learn how to use it! IMO, little guys try harder 😘
Impotency or ED can happen to anyone and everyone.  Stress can do some crazy things to our body. Proper sleep, diet and exercise, keeping hydrated...you know, the shit you’ve been told to do all your life  are important. Not getting the necessities can affect all sorts of things, including sexual performance and desire. 
Trust your woman, if she’s not leaving you for better sex, there must be more to you than just a cock that may or may not perform.

Education is forfeit for reinforcing such rules! 
Sound a feisty reveille while eyeing the schools! 
Neither will our heirs be agreeing to deceptions 
Once seeing, herein, these sufficient exceptions:

We were seized by a feeling 
For fleeing on the ceiling 
To a leisurely meal 
With Keith, Sheila, and Neil

We drank madeira, so foreign, in steins 
Along with a surfeit of weird blueish wines 
Being foolish, took codeine, ate ancient proteins 
Therein guaranteeing these ogreish scenes

Wherein we're canoeing to a new sovereign state 
While deicing a kaleidoscope on a hot jadeite plate 
And kneeing obeisance to an overseeing king 
Our plebeian lips kissed his counterfeit ring.

Then we unveiled their sleight-of-hand trick 
Deifying a heifer, with effect atheistic 
And falling from the heights with a loud seismic crunch 
We reignited the nonpareils we had heisted for lunch.

So I before E

My dad, brother and me where feasting on them until the owner got pissed and made us stop. It’s been a joke ever since, but also a true story. When I was young my mom would get whole chickens from the butcher and would always get extra feet. We would have fried chicken feet for supper. KFC should learn a few things.

There is no ‘Asian race’, Asia is a continent filled with over half the worlds population. Asian-American means everything from Indian to Cambodian To Han Chinese. The ‘Asian wealth’ statistic is skewed by the HUGE wealth of Indian American immigrants—and most Indians who migrate to America come here already being high class and having high education, so it’s easy to start and establish generational wealth.

For example, does a Muslim have the right to make jokes about terrorists killing Americans? And do you have the right to take offense? Or would that be considered being ""butthurt""?

Edit: the downvotes kinda proves my point. It's funny when its a despicable joke that doesn't hit close to home..
But when it does...suddenly not so funny huh? Honestly, I don't take offense to the joke. Because these are things white people only have the balls to say on the internet. I've read plenty of racist jokes on the internet,  I know plenty of white people in real life, I've never heard an actual black joke in real life.  Have your laughs behind the computer screen.

703i6r,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Yes, the military “route” was the most economical vs funding/financing training on your own.

hzm9h3,"I did this once!! Was driving home from work (50 min drive through traffic) when I got dangerously low on gas about 15 mins away from home with no gas stations for a few miles. After 10 minutes of traffic I made it to the nearest of ramp with a gas station and car died. Had to push almost a quarter mile to the station in the AZ 110* heat. 

About halfway to the station, the car got a lot lighter when I looked back and saw a homeless guy helping push the car. I was hot and I was exhausted and didn't even have the breath to thank him while pushing the car yet. So once I gained enough momentum and pulled into the gas station, I turned to thank the generous man who helped me for no reason only to see he was gone! I was shocked and only had maybe 15 dollars in my bank account. I filled up enough to get home and saw the man by the exit the car died at. Since I had no money to give him, I checked my backpack to see what I could give him and settled on a soda and fruit snacks I got from work lunch and my last joint I had rolled for after work. I drove past him, rolled down the window, handed him them all along with my lighter and said ""Thank you SO MUCH for your selfless act. I don't have much but hope this makes your day!"" 

He gave me a thumbs up and a smile and I couldn't help but think he deserved more but hoped that was enough to at least brighten his day 😁",2020-07-29 02:45:57

7e74jz,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2017-11-20 11:52:17

This knowledge would also mean he could help them with quick repairs and new installations, but as one could imagine most ships are far to large to have one backup team so he usually worked with three to four.

One example is when he was stationed abored the USS Foster (the then new experimental destroyer in the Navy) they were deployed out to the Persian gulf I believe? And the USS Wisconsin failed to launch her new tomahawk missile system to start the war so it fell on her backup the Foster and word of mouth spread that the man couldn't launch it and start a war due to religious reasons so they called in my Dad's FireControl team.

9huwsz,"To be fair, you need a very high IQ to understand The Room. The drama is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of human psychology most of the lines will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Johnny's increasingly depressive outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Polish literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lines, to realise that they're not just well-delivered- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Room truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the depth of Johnny's unique deliverance in ""I did not hit her, I did not,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to the fact that he did not hit her indeed. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tommy Wiseau's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

i3oewx,"Yes!  My grandmother had hip replacement surgery and part of her rehabilitation was to walk every day.  They gave her a walker but she did not like to use it because that was “for old people”.  So I would ask her to help me take my toddler on a stroller ride, Which worked a lot like a walker but included her adored great granddaughter.  When my grandmother no longer needed support to walk, I would take her and that same toddler on walks together, because they walked at the same pace 😊",2020-08-04 19:32:01

😛

And just to keep the score even....


A kid is in a bathroom, peeing, when a sailor comes in and uses urinal next to him. Little guy looks him up and down. Sailor asks the boy if he wants to wear his cap, so he says ""sure, mister!"". He's excited, running around, when a Marine enters and starts pissing also. The kid runs up and also gives him a head to toe look. Marine, clearly annoyed by such stare down barks at him: ""what's your deal kid? you want to suck my dick?""

But the above joke isn't malice, you could easily swap the roles of the two subjects of the joke and it wouldn't affect the point being made in the slightest. The crux of the joke is that the person in a position of authority (who happens to be a black man) could easily annihilate a perceived insubordinate (who happens to be a white man, so the fact that a black man has power over a white man is pretty powerful if you really wanna play into that dumb shit way of reading into things racially) for fucking his wife.

7d2asp,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment. The unlocks are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of selecting initial values based upon data from the Open Beta, Battlefront 2 will go over a typical gamers head. There's also EA's other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch, which are deftly woven into this game development- the game's philosophy draws heavily from average per-player credit earn rates, for instance. The gamers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate that we'll be making constant adjustments, to realise that it's not just fun- they say something deep about GAMES. As a consequence people who dislike EA truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, that we ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Mat Everett's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Mass Effect tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for appreciative gamers' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

I don’t make any rules about whats right to joke about. No one does.
I’m pointing out your ignorance towards black lives and that’s perfectly reasonable for anyone to do. If anything it’s a step forward.

Idk what your meaning of activism is but I can tell that you need to do some research. Or just joke about black lives and contribute to racism, up to you. Having conversed with you, it’s clear that you’re very sensitive and fragile about being called out and the latter is what you’d rather do because it’s easier for you. 

 If you’re sensitive to being pointed out..all I can say is that it’s your problem, and your part to do your research rather than defending yourself, not mine.",2020-06-02 11:27:58

7eqa75,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand this joke. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the joke will go over a typical reader’s head. There’s also Jack’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The readers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the joke, to realise that it’s not just funny- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike this joke truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Jack’s existential catchphrase “I’m sleeping with the priest’s wife,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jack’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer or phone screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Bob’s wife tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2017-11-22 15:02:52

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Countin'
One, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves me
Oh
Babe, pick a night
To come out and play
If it's alright
What do you say?
Merrier the more
Triple fun that way
Twister on the floor
What do you say?
Are you in
Livin' in sin is the new thing (yeah)
Are, you in
I am countin'
One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees

Oh
Three is a charm
Two is not the same
I don't see the harm
So are you game?
Lets' make a team
Make 'em say my name
Lovin' the extreme
Now are you game?

What we do is innocent
Just for fun and nothin' meant
If you don't like the company
Let's just do it you and me
You and me
Or three
Or four
On the floor!
One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
