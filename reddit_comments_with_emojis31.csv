Recipe here originally: [Easy Orange-Thyme Beef Stew](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/2020/10/30/easy-orange-thyme-beef-stew/)

This easy orange-thyme beef stew is loaded with rich, warming flavors and just a hint of sweetness thanks to a fresh blood orange.

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Inactive time: 3 hours 30 minutes

Total Time: 3 hours 50 minutes 

Servings: 6 

Calories: 483kcal

### Equipment

* Wide ovenproof pot with lid

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil for frying
* 3 pounds chuck or rump roast cut into bite-sized cubes
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 yellow onions peeled and cut into thin wedges
* 5-6 cups low-sodium beef stock
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme or 4 sprigs fresh thyme
* 1 head of garlic halved crosswise, do not remove the garlic skin; the head should remain intact
* 1 red Fresno pepper halved lengthwise, seeds removed, if desired
* 1 large blood orange or navel orange halved
* 1 pound young carrots tops removed and peeled; halved if the carrots are large
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Crushed red pepper to taste

#### For Serving:

* Mashed potatoes crusty bread, noodles, rice, or roasted potatoes
* Parsley for garnish

### Instructions

#### Brown the Beef:

* Preheat oven to 300ºF. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Pat the beef dry and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook in batches in an even layer until very well-browned, about 4-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

#### Cook the Aromatics:

* Melt the butter into the pot and add the onions. Cook, stirring regularly, for 4-5 minutes until softened. Add 1 cup of the beef stock and scrape up all the browned bits stuck to bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and stir occasionally for 4-5 minutes until reduced slightly.
* Return the beef back to the pot and reduce heat to low. Add the remaining beef stock. 
* Add the thyme, garlic halves (cut-side up) and the red Fresno pepper. Squeeze the juice from both orange halves over the beef and add the orange halves to the pot. Taste and season lightly with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Turn the heat off and cover the pot. Transfer to the oven for 2-3 hours until the beef is very tender.📷

#### Cook the Carrots:

* Return the pot to the stove over medium heat. Remove and discard the orange and chili pepper. Remove the garlic from the pot. Once cool enough to handle, pop the cloves from the paper and mash them into a paste. Work the garlic paste back into the broth. Taste and season the broth to your preferences. Add the carrots and cook, covered, for 15-30 minutes on low heat until tender. Remove the cover and cook for 5-10 minutes over medium heat to allow the sauce in the pan to thicken.
* If needed, add a splash or two of water. If a thicker gravy is desired, add a flour slurry to the pan and whisk it in and allow it took for an additional 5-10 minutes to thicken.

#### To Serve:

* Ladle the beef stew over mashed potatoes or your accompaniment of choice. Garnish with parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

l08scx,"I’m doing the opposite- eating so much crap that I wouldn’t normally eat to desperately hope to taste something. I’ve found very fatty, spicy things give me some kind of flavour- maybe 10%. I also find myself eating more as I’m never satisfied. I’m scared I’m going to be huge by the time it comes back 🤣",2021-01-19 09:49:29

l08scx,"Not yet, I'm probably about 45%, and then a lot of things just aren't right. Like almost all fruit has the same flavor, a very sickly planty flavor that's very repulsive. Tried eating an apple the other day and had to spit it out. My kid's toothpaste smells wack too. Basically I went from anosmia, to partial anosmia with a lot of parosmia. 😮‍💨",2021-05-13 10:42:45

l08scx,I can still taste but I can’t smell anything besides that horrible smell. It smells like I’m smelling my lungs or my brain fluid or something. It’s disgusting and I can’t even describe it because I’ve never smelled this smell before. It’s not Ammonia or cat piss.. it’s like.. sterile death.  Been three days.

rufyy8,"The best thing from the recipe was the boiling stage, it asks you to boil them until they are pretty much falling apart! 
Do not toss in a colander after because they will fall apart into mashed potato. Just let them cool on a wire rack a little before they go in the oven. The cooling will firm them up enough so you can toss in the heated fat of choice 👌🏻",2022-01-02 22:27:39

px6f4f,"The brisket here is unmatched, yes! But alas, it’s like the locals have never even heard of pastrami. They don’t carry it here at the meat lockers, in delis, or even in those crappy 5- serving plastic containers you find  at Target. The only time I can get it in this state is when Subway brings it back every year or so (🤮)",2021-09-28 21:29:05
px6f4f,"Lies!  Katz is still pretty stellar. Well I still enjoy it. It doesn't dry out of you don't eat the whole thing and put it in the fridge. I don't mind Pastrami Queen. It's closer than Katz but given a choice Katz wins. I also enjoy the pickles and tomato's.

I remember when the sandwiches were actually BIGGER 👀


Half pastrami half brisket on marble for the win...

kuq1l1,"Sounds very delicious 😋 we have all of our bakeries open for takeaway!  There are a lot of easy recipes with blueberry on YouTube, you should try some. My recipe is quite difficult but worth trying as well;)",2021-01-11 21:28:27
kuq1l1,"Wooow! You've made an incredible job!!! Thank you for feedback and photos!!! Answering your questions - while making meringue there are few steps. You have to whip the egg whites at a low speed till they become a foam with tiny bubbles of the same size, let's say like beer foam! Only after you should add first part of your sugar. Whip a bit, add more, whip a bit longer, still at low speed and add the last portion of sugar. Whip until soft peak! 

Your biscuit looks great. You can lower just a bit your temperature next time so it won't burn but it's not a big deal in your case!

As for the white chocolate, I wouldn't recommend to substitute it for another one. I was adding rubby chocolate instead of white one and that was an awesome idea. But I doubt it would taste good with other ones. I would add more powdered sugar so the cream will be sweet enough. And whip it properly in cream consistency! 

But GANACHE cream can be made of any chocolate you like! My best one is from dark chocolate! Absolutely delicious! You will love the contract between the very cake and the ganache itself! Of course you can use milk one or ruby as well! I would recommend you to watch some YouTube tutorials about ganache if you've never been making it. Cause it can be tricky. The cream starts solidify as soon as it touches cold cake. But it's not a problem if you have a proper instruments for coverage.

If have any questions left - I'm happy to help! Good luck with your final stage ❤️❤️❤️",2021-01-22 08:00:24

nc83ow,"Hi First it’s  the traditional mint tea , on the far right it’s Msemen a traditional North African pastry , next to it it’s «  tartelette » it’s a family recipe it’s made with nuts and white chocolate or almond and black chocolate, then the sables cookies some are filled with apricot or strawberry jam others with Nutella , the little balls around the table are «  Richbond » and in the middle it’s baghrir with honey and melted butter in the middle of the plate. 
I have a tiktok and an Instagram: smahan.Brc where I share my recipes . 🤎",2021-05-14 23:38:43

11j4qg4,"> Asian and Mexican fusion food is always great

Idk I've eaten some pretty terrible attempts at Japanese-Mexican fusion (like soft tacos with teriyaki sauce and pico de gallo...🤢). But I've also had really good fusions like sushi burritos where they actually use nori instead of tortillas. 

I think fusion is better when it leans more towards one cuisine or the other, because if it tries to too hard to be both, then it can sometimes backfire",2023-03-05 19:53:14

o5uv2m,"This week’s sushi boat!! I was MIA last week since I was busy moving, so I’m excited to get back into my sushi flow this week. Two new rolls this week and one of them is a new favorite! 

Boat breakdown: On the left is my new Umami Tsunami Roll featuring Japanese BBQ sauce! Inside the Umamai Tsunami is shrimp tempura and avocado, on top is a generous layer of tuna topped with Japanese BBQ sauce (I used Bachan’s brand) and green onion. This roll is a tidal wave of flavor 🌊 and definitely a new favorite!! 

In the middle is a simple soy/sake/mirin marinated salmon roll, with avocado and green onion.

On the right is my new Fire & Ice Roll, spicy tuna and cream cheese on the inside, topped with avocado, spicy mayo, and spicy garlic crunch!  This roll was FILLING but so delicious.

Lastly, the front of the boat holds two tuna nigiri that have been lightly brushed with sesame oil, and the back has six salmon nigiri brushed with my favorite lemon olive oil. This was one of my favorite boats so far!!

o5uv2m,"Thank you for these great questions! I’m obsessed with cooking and have gotten pretty adventurous with it, I really enjoy trying out new things and learning new techniques. Sushi is my favorite food but I avoided ever making it at home. I was afraid it would be too difficult or I would make myself sick or something. 

About 6 months ago I realized I was being silly and since it’s my favorite food I should at least give it a try. Well my first batch went WAY better than I anticipated. I was completely blown away by the quality of fish my local Japanese grocery store sold (better than most mid-tier sushi restaurants I would frequent), and while the process is time consuming, it’s not as difficult as people make it out to be. 

I was basically hooked after the first batch and started recreating my favorite rolls from local sushi places and learning more techniques like how to do all the toppings (just through Google and YouTube). I had originally been worried it would be hard to work in much variety in such a small batch but I quickly found that wasn’t the case and started coming up with lots of new roll ideas to try out. Now I have a super long idea list that is constantly growing and I’m trying out new ideas almost every week! 

I noticed that a lot of other people were either scared or too intimidated to try making sushi at home so that’s why I started trying to share some recipes and video guides to show that it’s possible! Quite a few people have told me they tried it for the first time because of my posts and that’s such a cool feeling! 😊 I’m hoping to be able to lean into it a little more and maybe start a website and YouTube when I have a little more time. 

The thing that has evolved the most is definitely my creativity for coming up with new ideas. My techniques have all gotten better as well but honestly that doesn’t make the sushi taste that different, just look better.",2021-06-22 23:47:33
o5uv2m,"Yes yes!! There is sooooo much variety out there, there is tons of stuff you would enjoy :) look up some menus for local sushi places and read the descriptions. There should be lots of rolls that fit your taste plus stuff like the nigiri ☺️",2021-06-22 19:40:34

c8owjh,"So legit, up until a few years ago I thought a cheesecake was 'a cake made of cheese' because the English language is retarded and what a word *is* is essentially never what it *describes*. So for the longest time I wondered why people ate a big slice of cheese with frosting or whatever on top, and why the fuck it's so much money.

I eventually tried a piece and, though I wouldn't place any bets either way, I'm leaning towards 'not actually cheese' and 'another lie designed by language-inventing asses'. But for all I know it's some conspiracy or something and really everything we've ever consumed is cheese.

🧀 there's a slice of cheese that looks like cake. Or a slice of cake that looks like cheese. Will we ever know the truth?

That's sweet thank you and good that it made you smile 😄

Good idea! You got this.",2020-03-25 15:21:09
foo23w,I would recommend between low and medium. You don't want the sides to burn and a raw pancake. Just pay attention if it goes to fast or that it has the time to 'cook'. But every pan/stove is different. You will notice when it's the right heat setting. Better too low then to high 😉,2020-03-25 14:57:49
foo23w,"No harm done! Sounds good, it's nice to see so many positive reactions and that people also want to make pancakes. Have fun 🥞",2020-03-25 15:13:44

I have an actual smasher at work but you can use another pan. Make sure to hit the bottom of your smashing pan with spray so the patty doesn't stick to it. Just smash down as hard as you can til they're nice and thin and cook until you have a nice brown color. When you flip, add your cheese and then a little water to the pan to help melt the cheese and you're good to go 👍",2023-02-08 21:12:53

I see your point, I just think it's completely pathetic. Who cares if someone's post gets more likes or upvotes because they included their age (or a photo of themselves)? Only sad and pathetic people do. Personally I don't even care if people feel proud of their age or of the way they look, and want to be open about it online. Or if they want to gain more karma or likes by doing it, still, I don't care because it doesn't harm anyone in any way.

mq8pa5,"If you are not a man, then you should definitely google the term ""internalized misogyny"", because this is what you suffer from. That's why you feel the need to insult random women online for posting photos of themselves, when in fact that comment was completely irrelevant and off topic, I repeat. Why do you care if other women post photos of themselves in order to get likes in the first place? Oh and it's not cliche to call out misogyny or sexism. I'm sorry if the world feels like an ""insufferable fucking place"" to you because of that 🤷‍♀️ Maybe start educating yourself for a change? Then you'll understand why so many people nowadays talk about that cliche stuff.

But really, what's your problem if people (no matter what age or gender they are) look for attention or for upvotes online? Just let them be. No one will steal anyone's likes or upvotes, I assure you. Everyone gets their piece! No need to feel threatened by strangers online when they get attention. This makes you look like a bitter and immature person, I repeat. 

It's funny how you accuse me of making assumptions because I am stupid and I have no original way of thinking.. unlike you, the person who likes using incel cliches in their comments. What an original way of thinking for yourself! Btw I don't think it's weird of me to assume that you are bitter and sad, when you find stupid reasons to attack people online and you make a big deal out of it. Because they mentioned their age on their post title, wow, what a crime! We definitely need to start a petition for that! 😂

I think it's a little weird to accuse me of treating people as ""walking cliches"", when in fact YOU are the person who wrote these comments:

*""Petition to cancel all posts that start with “I’m only \_\_\_ age!” to garner sympathy upvotes."" "" having to open with “I’m \_\_\_ age” is such an overused and pathetic way to try to draw attention to yourself. ""*  
Assuming that someone mentioned their age because they are pathetic and they want to draw attention to themselves 🤔 Okay this sounds a little bit cliche.

*""It’s not my fault you’re such a simpleton that you’re unable to see through people.*   
Assuming I am a simpleton, only because I asked you one question in my first comment. Only because I disagreed with you. Okay this assumption might be a little hasty, don't you think? 🤔

*""Again, if you had one bit of critical thinking and truly understood how actual human beings function and don’t just see them as walking cliches, maybe you’d understand. Yet clearly you don’t and would prefer to defend some twat that felt they had to bolster attention by letting the world know “I’m arbitrary age guys.”*   
Wow, you seem like a really intelligent and insightful person. What a deep understanding of the human psyche that you have! Because when you are 14 years old and you mention your age online, you want attention. And you are a twat for doing that! And when people disagree with your opinion, they are stupid because they don't see the world the way they should, the way YOU see the world. 

Well... based on all that, you seem like a narcissistic and self-centered person. But maybe I say that only because I am a walking cliche myself 🤷‍♀️",2021-04-14 12:45:56
mq8pa5,Great idea 😂 I really don't get why people are being so immature and bitter here. Offended because a 14-year-old's post got more upvotes than yours? Just get over it 🤷‍♀️,2021-04-14 09:55:28

I’m absolutely ecstatic to add this to my list of serving dishes. I can’t post videos here but you can find some videos of it in operation on my Instagram ([@CraftyCookbook](https://instagram.com/craftycookbook?igshid=et7z4gbq8uva)).

Breakdown: On the train is a mix of the following nigiri: salmon with lemon olive oil, salmon with chili oil and spicy garlic, salmon with sesame oil, tuna with yakiniku sauce, tuna with sesame oil, and tuna with chili oil and spicy garlic. With a stocked pantry you can get a lot of variety, it really feels like you’re at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant stocked with only your favorites!!

In addition to the train there are two of my favorite rolls, the Super Salmon Crunch roll - shrimp tempura and avocado on the inside topped with salmon, spicy mayo, tempura crunch, and spicy garlic crunch, and the Umami Tsunami roll - shrimp tempura and avocado on the inside topped with tuna, brushed with yakiniku sauce (Japanese bbq sauce) and topped with green onion. Also miso soup and sake on the side!

ldb69u,southerner here and i honestly prefer brown gravy. i prefer the beefy savory flavor over cream gravy. though when i make it i do a brown gravy with cream added for the best of both worlds 😋,2021-02-05 21:43:46

ldb69u,That looks absolutely phenomenal. Are those mushrooms in the gravy? Brilliant! and the crust on the steak looks absolutely perfect. 👍 I'm making some fried chicken later today and if they look half as good as your steak does I'll be very happy. :D,2021-02-07 11:15:53
ldb69u,I completely agree! Keep the coating for chicken and let the steak speak for itself. 👍,2021-02-05 20:03:17
ldb69u,"There's a lot of interesting commentary about what sort of gravy should go with this. It seems to vary geographically throughout the US. 

As this was made in the UK... brown gravy it is. 👍",2021-02-05 21:30:27

ldb69u,Phew... 🥴,2021-02-05 21:57:37
ldb69u,"All correct and I agree, however rump/sirloin is typically the cheapest steak (as in pre-cut single portions) available here so that's what I went with.

We'd call 'round steak' silverside or topside, I believe, which in supermarkets would be sold in a large single lump for roasting. Not worth it when just cooking for one or two people. Could've gone to a butcher I suppose but that's not worth the bother. 

👍",2021-02-05 23:20:26
ldb69u,"It's an American concoction. A beef steak hammered flat then covered in what one would usually coat fried chicken in. 

Hence ""chicken fried"" steak. 👍",2021-02-06 11:07:34

Yes, always reserve the oils after cooking, lard is what the original calls for but other oil can be used! Oil + cayenne = artery clogging goodness.

I did just return from a multi-day camping trip, and the old Dutch oven could really use a bit of soap inside and out. 😬

It’s all fine. The more you use cast iron, the easier it is to clean. Just about the only rule I follow with cast iron is not throwing really cold stuff into it while it’s really hot.",2020-06-29 22:15:32

l5u526,"Butter. So. Much. Butter. 

And don't butter the pan, the batter is supposed to be self non-stick, that's how you get that really smooth color effect.

3 eggs, 2ish cups (500ml) of buttermilk (some version of sour milk in other countries), a stick or 150g of butter, melted

Some people even use plain yogurt.

1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder

1/2 tsp salt

1-2 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla flavoring/vanilla sugar

3 tbs of sugar (you can substitute some for brown sugar too)

Lots of flour 

Mix eggs and sugar for all eternity or until you get bored (or it gets fluffier)

Add buttermilk/sour milk and vanilla

Mix dry ingredients together with a bit of flour to ensure no baking soda or powder is sticking

Add to batter

Add flour until it gets thick enough, some like their 🥞 thinner (smooth batter, mix longer), some like 🥞 thick (lumpy batter, add more flour and don't mix so much), but thickness should be at least enough that some rounded peaks form in the batter and don't disappear right away.

Add melted butter fold in.

That's about it!

Hot pan or griddle, a bit more than halfway on the heat between min and max.

Add a ladleful of batter, or if you need to make them for a crowd in a pan, three smaller ladles on the edges of the pan (football 🏈 shaped pancakes are still good). Flip when bubbles pop and stay open.",2021-01-27 10:46:03

p6bgx8,"No worries friend, I’ve got a copy-paste reply for this one 😉 I don’t have it overnight, if there’s any left over I usually just eat it or toss it. 

Here’s my rice recipe! There’s a video walkthrough on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/craftycookbook?igshid=et7z4gbq8uva) story archives for the rice if you’re interested! Pictured on the boat is ~1 batch of rice.

# Ingredients 

* 1 ½ cups uncooked short grain sushi rice
* ¼ cup + 2 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar
* 2 tbsp white sugar
* ½ tbsp salt 

# Prep

1. Rinse rice in a large pot until the water drains clear, then drain and add 1 ¾ cup water. 
2. Cover and bring to a boil for 4 minutes, then reduce heat and simmer on low for 15 minutes. 
3. After simmering kill the heat and let the pot stand (covered) for 15 more minutes.
4. Transfer the rice into a large bowl to cool. Add the vinegar, sugar, and salt and mix well. (it may seem wet at this point, you want to mix so all the grains are coated in vinegar.
5. Allow the rice to cool uncovered or loosely covered, and mix it occasionally, until it reaches room temp ~1 hour, then use for rolls or nigiri.",2021-08-18 04:27:24

p6bgx8,"Interesting I hear you have to keeping it frozen for salmon and tuna at least 7 days to kill all the worms and bacteria. and even transportation needs to be frozen hence you need to bring a cooler when you buy it for sushi. You need make sure your manufacturer did this. This is what my local sushi place does. 

Or get smoked salmon. 🤷🏻‍♀️ It's easier but tastes not as good for sushi in my opinion. And for other fish like escolar/whitefish octopus scallops etc, it is much more different with their own preparations. I'm sure crab sticks and shrimp would be easy though- but shellfish have different prep.",2021-08-18 07:10:34

p6bgx8,Gotta support a fellow Kirby 💜,2021-08-17 23:11:42
p6bgx8,"That’s awesome, so glad you all enjoyed the experience! On the rolling - you want the side of the nori that will become the center of the roll to have rice all the way to the edge, on the other side (that will be on the outside) you can either leave a small strip of nori clear or cover it all in rice, it should stick either way. 

When rolling you want to go slowly, and feel free to unroll if it doesnt seem tight in the beginning (it will look messy in the moment but will be totally hidden once you re-roll). Focus on getting the beginning of the roll tight since that is the hardest part, use your fingers to press it in and not just the rolling mat. Make sure your fillings are uniform across the length so you don’t have an issue where it is tight on one part and loose on another. 

It will probably take a few times to get the hang of it but it sounds like you’re on the right track! 😊",2021-09-07 17:20:59

114cz6k,"Curries are hard to make pretty, and this shop really tried, it definitely a pretty presentation. What makes the curries food porn is reminding me how orgasmic those spices taste and smell, and the mouth feel of those sauces. Really working on a lot of senses 🤤 

Then, if it's like the curry shop I go to, a proud grandma is watching you enjoy your curry. She's got homemade mango or strawberry gelato and some baklavas waiting for you for dessert. This woman can cook and you know these recipes have been passed down for generations. And you're checking out her gorgeous grandson with these piercing eyes, and that smile when he brings you your food and...

Aw another day, another meal, still didn't get his number, but the food was delicious. Who needs men when you've got food like this. 😍",2023-02-17 13:27:56

114cz6k,"Haha well americans salivate over plastic made to look like food, so shits weird all over 😅. A couple of people throughout the post mentioned they didn't like how much of the different curries were touching. It might be a similar situation for them.",2023-02-17 19:48:59

xo3x9s,"In politics and power, quantity matters most. 

> Ends justify the means. Never really put stock into people who really believe that. If that's the point you guys are starting from then you've really messed up on making cities more like the places you idealize.

You're not that intelligent. The laws that made the cities so horrible in North America are 50 to 100 years old. This movement is new and consists of mostly gen z, of course changes haven't magically happened everywhere 😂

> In the company of fools, by example right here. ""The jokes are funny so people come around"", will it be too late when you've discovered that the people who like idiot humor are also idiots and they now outnumber you?

So far the only fragile idiot is you, who get so insanely triggered by this political movement its actually hilarious. Grow up. Elon musk makes so many lies and shit posts about public transport being bad for example, it's important to have memes that counter it.

You're like an old church monk complaining about newspapers and that ideas can't possibly spread through that, only books carry the weight.",2022-09-27 06:32:54
xo3x9s,"You're making a lot of assumptions here. Elon Musk 😂 Really? I've made statements on ""power"" and if this is how you carry yourself, I wouldn't want anyone you're representative of to wield it.

I'd love more walkable and bikeable cities but I'd also like fewer screeching morons. I think the idea is more popular than you think and you just want to feel good about ""being a part of it"". So much hubris for someone misdirecting their efforts.

 I guess we're both just equally effective eh? Since you're so young just remember the only thing Reddit has really accomplished in real life is getting the wrong person arrested and accidentally meme'ing the worst president in history into office while simultaneously creating a network of fascists.

They take a bit of time but they're well worth it! Takes me about 2-3 hours as you need to let the dough rise and cook the pork slowly, but I've seen other recipes that take much longer to make the char siu.",2020-06-14 18:45:21

hyf3pq,"I made a batch of rasberry that is delicious.  Now I feel incomplete.  I've been wanting to make some BlackBerry jam too ...I guess it's time to get out there and start picking.  🍇

Edit: Forgot to mention, raspberries were ones my 8-yr old and I picked from the yard and stored in the freezer for this batch we did.  Even the lemon came from our yard.  I wish sugarcane adapted to Northern California so it could all be yard supplies for the jam.  Jam from your yard is oh so sweet (well, with sugar/honey from somewhere else).  Blackberrues are onsite and about 100 yards away too",2020-07-26 22:59:51
hyf3pq,Simply gorgeous. I've recently reintroduced myself to jam and jelly now that I've remembered there's more than just strawberry 😆,2020-07-27 00:42:49
hyf3pq,"Very creative display of beautifully jarred jams.  👍🏼
 
   They also look lip smacking  good . Would love a dollop of jam like that on a very thin slice of blue cheese on a rice cracker. Yum 😋",2020-07-27 00:52:53

10r8zwb,Melted ghee. 😂 It’s clarified butter.,2023-02-02 03:33:51
10r8zwb,I did… told myself the orange stuff must be the potatoes referenced (sweet potatoes?) because I’ve never seen potatoes prepared like that. Maybe that’s part of the lobster? Idk I’m not fancy enough to know. I do wish they were scallops bc 🤤.,2023-02-02 02:21:15
10r8zwb,Yeah 😂,2023-02-02 15:57:54

10r8zwb,Well not drill probably 😂,2023-02-02 18:00:53
10r8zwb,When I got to one with “American waygu beef jerky” I rolled my eyes and stopped scrolling 😂,2023-02-02 13:27:45
10r8zwb,"This happens a lot. I work at a grocery store and we got way too many chicken breasts. 2-6 pound packs were 1-3 dollars, it was glorious😂",2023-02-02 01:54:12
10r8zwb,So the receipt clearly shows this was not a $20 meal 👍,2023-02-02 09:20:30

10r8zwb,"Wow, that’s a big compliment! And twice over because I came with proof lol. Thank you guys 😄
  
I think I broke down the price pretty spot on for the meal pictured. My partner got the other steak, the remaining broccoli, and a twice baked potato out of it for not much more. He just doesn’t like seafood.",2023-02-02 01:33:11

10r8zwb,Thanks for sharing! That’s so cool. I hit up my local one all the time for lunch and have tried to recreate several of their dishes including their ranch dressing. Been pretty successful with it. Thank you 😊,2023-02-02 03:10:51
10r8zwb,"Well this is scallops, chicken, and cauliflower. 🤷‍♂️",2023-02-02 13:37:41
10r8zwb,How did you know I love that 😅,2023-02-02 15:29:42
10r8zwb,"The ranch is equal parts buttermilk and mayo with hidden valley seasoning that's been rebranded specifically for them. The HV restaurant packet you can buy at the store is almost identical. 

And if you're into the Parm crusted chicken, the Parm spread is made with equal parts ranch dressing & grated parm, top that with provolone cheese (at home I do a mix of Provo & mozz), and topped with garlic butter bread crumbs mixed with shaved Parm. That one is a family favorite in our house. 

If you want to know anything else I'm happy to pass along my knowledge, but it looks like you're already doing it better 😁",2023-02-02 03:41:59
10r8zwb,"You know, I might have been thinking of roadhouse 😅. It's been so long since I've been to either. I'll try to find a few copy cat recipes. Thanks for the tips 😁",2023-02-02 13:34:00

And text: 

For the dough: 

6 yolks, 

120 grams of sugar, 

200 ml of milk, 

100 ml of vegetable oil, 

120 grams of flour, 

10 grams of baking powder, 

1 tablespoon of vanilla sugar,

 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder. 


For the filling : 

6 egg whites, 

120 g of sugar

 //30 ml of water, 100 grams of sugar


Glaze: 160 grams of chocolate + 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil 

Preparation of Munchmallow cakes:

Whisk the sugar and egg yolks, then add the milk, vanilla sugar, and oil and mix everything well with a mixer. Add baking powder to the flour and mix it. Add flour and cocoa to the egg mixture. Pour the biscuit mixture on baking paper, then bake in an oven preheated to 200 C - about twenty minutes.

While the biscuit is baking, whisk the egg whites until you get solid snow. Add 10 tablespoons of sugar and vanilla sugar, then stir a little more. 

Put 10 spoons of sugar and 4 spoons of water in the pot, and then mix this by hand, without a mixer. Gradually add the melted sugar to the egg whites, stirring constantly.

 Spread the mixture on the crust and return for another 10 minutes in the oven, which you have reduced to 120 C.

 Make the glaze from chocolate, oil and water. Pour over the Munchmallow, when cooled down.

 Put to the fridge for two hours. Enjoy.",2022-04-30 17:11:51

I recently tried his tsukemen recipe (also ~18 hours), and started it before going to bed, but all the water evaporated in just a few hours. 😢 If I try it again this way, I might try it the way you described. Though, I think I might just get a pressure cooker and cut that 18 hours down to a more manageable 3. 😊",2021-03-11 10:56:00

hrpg39,"I've made them a few times over lockdown, having not done them for years.

Your first batch will go wrong, it's almost inevitable! Don't worry and be prepared to try again.

I much prefer going for the French meringue over Italian meringue method. You can find macaron recipes with both. Italian is much more fiddly, so more power to you if you can manage it, but just a heads up that you'll be totally fine using French style!

If you add colouring, your mix might look bright, but be prepared to lose colour as they bake. I've just bought some really high quality gel food colouring and it makes the world of difference. You don't want to risk messing the mix up by adding lots of liquid colouring so this was a great move I found. 

Good luck, they're so much fun to make and taste great! I've recently tried lime and orange ones by mixing zest in. And then some blackcurrant ones - which were actually just coloured purple and plain flavoured, but with a layer of blackcurrant jam in with the buttercream in the middle! All good options 😃",2020-07-15 21:09:41

12wf1nn,Hey many thanks for those tips! I use canned tomatoes and usually crush the tomatoes by hand without the tomato juice but this time I only had one can of tomatoes and 5 pizzas to make so I used the whole can to make sure I have enough sauce 😂 I will definitely try that evaporation trick next time!

12wf1nn,A slice or two… or the whole pizza?😂,2023-04-24 10:00:54
12wf1nn,I know right? still you would need an open flame and a stone to make a pizza like this... now that would be cool 😂,2023-04-23 20:58:15
12wf1nn,haha for sure! And guess who just has to measure every ingredient to the gram 😂,2023-04-23 20:34:38
12wf1nn,"the sauce I used here is very simple: finely crush canned tomatoes (without the juice) by hand, add salt, some olive oil and basil. San Marzano tomatoes are ofc preferred. It doesn't need anything else 👌🏻",2023-04-23 20:53:30
12wf1nn,Well hello there (distant) neighbor! We do that too here in Finland so no it's fresh yeast 😊,2023-04-23 20:00:08

12wf1nn,"I have koda 12 which is nice and compact, excellent build quality! In retrospect I think I would have been happier with the koda 16 as there is ofc more space inside the oven to move the pizza around as it cooks and you can cook larger pizzas (like NY style) in it, but for my needs koda 12 was a good choice and works well for me too. I might upgrade to karu 16 when I move to larger home as it has all those benefits and gives multiple fuel choices: gas for convenience and wood when feeling extra fancy 😂 but in all honesty, learning to make pizza dough, handle that dough and bake it are hard enough by themself even in a gas oven so I'm happy I got a koda for my first oven",2023-04-25 10:27:57
12wf1nn,"Of course! oh and btw ""extremely high"" refers to the baking temperature a little typo there 😂",2023-04-23 19:22:37

12wf1nn,"Hey no prob! You can't go wrong with the koda 12 & 16 and btw you can use koda 16 as an outdoor oven as well to cook other things too. I thought I should mention that in case it helps you kitchen-less situation! I've been making my own dough for a long time (like 14 years?) even before I got the ooni so it didn't take me a long time to learn how to make a decent dough (actually good dough is a whole other story 😂). I tried store bought once and it wasn't good at all so I would avoid that. If you need a more convenient option try fermenting the dough at room temp using a direct method or make a poolish if you want to save some fridge space. I imagine it is a precious commodity in a camper 😂 Vito Iacopelli has great poolish recipes on his YouTube channel if you want to check that out! and btw making the dough is relatively easy, handling and baking it is the hard part that needs practice!",2023-04-25 11:41:37

ex9rmq,Was the first place we went to after landing in Chicago from New Zealand. After a 15 hour flight we wanted something quick and easy and there was a Shake shack within stumbling distance. Nice burgers and fries and the guy filling my GFs wine glass forgot to stop the machine so it was a completely full tumbler of whatever their “house”  wine was 😄😄😄,2020-02-02 00:01:19

ex9rmq,"It’s legendary in NZ(along with the looooong queues)but the friends I know who tried them, were a bit let down. Not bad but not the “be all and end all”.  

I live in Wellington and each year there’s a food festival in winter to liven things up. They have a “Burger Wellington” competition running and pretty much EVERY cafe/restaurant/food truck gets involved....or gets left in the dust. For two weeks it’s absolute mayhem and invariably you eat far too many ridiculous burgers. 

To be honest, a simple and tasty cheese burger hits the spot for me 😀",2020-02-02 06:00:21

I also cook for a few mins in the oven before moving it up and finishing off on the grill, game changer for me personally. Good luck on your cooking adventures ❤",2022-10-28 10:32:19
oad989,"# Boat breakdown:
On the left is my new Hot Date roll: shrimp tempura and cucumber on the inside, topped with spicy crab stick, jalapeño slice, and a dot of sriracha. The jalapeño I had was a HOT one so this roll was super spicy 🥵.

The middle roll is salmon marinated for \~1 hour in lemon olive oil, plus cucumber and avocado.

On the right is my new Filthy Rich roll - crab salad California roll on the inside, on top is alternating salmon and avocado, topped with eel sauce and garlic chips.

Two ebi (shrimp) nigiri in the front, and 4 salmon nigiri in the back. Miso soup on the side.

oad989,"Haha yeah I bought the boat after my first batch because I was hooked and it seemed like a ridiculous item to own 😂 (I love serving my home cooking in restaurant style dishes) 

I purchase sushi/sashimi grade fish from a Japanese grocery store! You can typically find fish safe for sushi/sashimi at any Asian grocery store, but Japanese is the best bet if you can find one near you. It’s safe to eat raw and also significantly higher quality than what you’d find at a typical American grocery store (at least in my experience).",2021-06-29 20:05:33
oad989,"Also about ~7 months (started right after Christmas), but I’m an avid home cook so a lot of the skills transferred. I’m also kinda a crazy perfectionist so that helps too 😅",2021-06-29 21:35:32

oad989,Agreed! I’ve been trying to think of other similar ingredients I could work in as well 🤔 I’m going to try habaneros at some point,2021-06-30 02:07:02
oad989,"So for my basic spicy mayo I just do ratio of 1 tbsp Japanese mayo & 1 tsp sriracha. For the spicy crab I do a ratio of 1 tbsp Japanese mayo, 1 tsp Sriracha. 1/2 tsp sesame oil, 1/2 tsp lemon juice, 1 crab stick. The spicy crab sauce is wayyy tastier but it’s too runny to be my stand alone spicy mayo so I might work on thickening it up sometime soon 🤔",2021-06-30 03:03:41

9a6b60,"Firstly, if you’re making ravs that look like these, make sure you don’t over stretch the top piece of pasta.   You can see these are stretched probably a bit too far. 

Secondly, make sure that when you press  the two sheets together, you squish them together to flatten them out to the thickness of one sheet, so it all cooks at  the same rate. 

Thirdly, don’t make your filling too wet. It rehydrates the pasta sheet on top and makes it prone to break. 

Fourthly, try and avoid air bubbles. 

- I’m the chef in at Italian restaurant. We’re pretty serious about pasta. Hope it helps. 

- also, great work OP👍",2018-08-25 14:07:26

9a6b60,"Yes! I could check all the boxes on that answer! On a personal note as a ravioli fan that learned a shitload the hard way: I started out with a metal ravioli board, using too little flour and leaving me to dig out the single pouches one. By. One... after I started using flour as a non-stick agent, life got easier. (And if that was wrong, please enlighten me 😋)",2018-08-25 19:37:28

joaewt,"They are surprisingly simple (especially if you buy pre-made dough)! The “hardest” part was how long it took to roll each piece of dough and stuff. A note if you do make them, cook a little filling before stuffing them so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly. I made them about a year ago and they were amazing. Make a huge batch of them to freeze and you reheat them just like the store bought ones. You can also get creative with the stuffing and get some unique flavors (like extra lean ground beef and cheddar, or bbq chicken). 

(I like to put oil in the pan, add the frozen 🥟 , add about 1/4 cup water, bring to boil then cover and simmer 8-12 minutes depending on size, then remove lid and let water evaporate and cook until crispy, careful it can splatter and get messy)",2020-11-05 08:10:26

7z0ot4,"Yeah You lucky duckies seem to have the better of the burger joints by most accounts. Around here if you want a burger better than Five Guys, you're drifting out of fast-food territory. I'll go to Five Guys and get a bacon cheeseburger with extra bacon & cheese with any toppings and more fries than I'll eat for ~$10 - Where I live the cheapest meal you can get outside of a grocery store is taco bell with it's $5 meals, or any number of similar mega chain Value™ meals, but that stuff is really only acceptable after bars start closing. 

*Most* fresh, quality controlled [take-out / counter service only / drive thru / delivery] meals will cost anywhere from $6+ for mediocre, or ""special offer"" fast food, up to $15-20 for nice quality carryout or delivery (not counting tips or delivery fees). Further price brackets of meals are omitted as the responsible adults who don't have to devote this much time to analyzing the cost of their individual junk food meals.

Five Guys is right in that $10-15 range where you know you're getting a nice meal that will fill you up, and even if you could get better food or cheaper food, you're happy to be out of the taco bell bracket (no h8) but you're ballin' on a budget and you ain't gonna pay some kid to bring you refills when you got a fridge full of 2 liters you got on sale, and the markup on soda is so gal durn ridiculous in the first place! It's a touch of syrup and some soda water that comes out of a hose. I know goddamn well that only a fool would pay for a can of soda or a to go cup when that money could get you like 10x the amount of soda if your lazy ass is willing to go to the grocery store once in a while.

b77nq6,Waiting for the recipe 😋🤤,2019-03-30 08:23:57
b77nq6,"Receipe:

  


Use -ish for the quantities.. i don't follow an exact guide.

  


🐔 breasts (cubes) - (500gms-ish)

🍅 - 6-7 large-ish (diced)

🍋 - (can skip, np)

Heavy cream - 1cups -ish

Yogurt - 1-1.5 cups

2 large red onions (thin slices)

4 cloves of garlic - make a paste of 2 and thinly slice 2

Ginger paste - about 2 tbsp

Cilantro - about a handful - finely chopped

Butter

Salt (how much ever salt you want/need)

Spices: *toast and grind (for optimum tasteness):* dried corriander seeds about 2tbsp), cinnamon (2 sticks) black cloves (1) star anise (1), cumin (2 tbsp), mustard seeds (2 tbsp), red chilli- (adjust as needed)

Oil - enough to coat the meat (i prefer mustard oil over vegetable oil)

Mix yogurt, the spices, oil (and lemon), ginger & garlic .. drop chicken cubes in & marinate over night (for optimum tastiness)

Next day grill the chicken in an oven at 450 for about 10-15 mins, use skewers for optimum efficiency.

Next: sautee onions & garlic in melted butter. Once the onions are brown-ish, dump in the diced 🍅, use some more of that goody spices (go wild.. don't. Use about 2-3 tbsp), then soften them and break them apart (use a blender for optimum efficiency - use *pulse* 4-5 times) pour them back in a pot, add cream, stir and let boil on low-ish heat for about 10 mins (where the center makes bubbles) - stir occasionally..

Add in the chicken cubes , stir and let them cook in for another 10-15 mins. Taste for salt one final time, if all good, add in the chopped cilantro and give one last round of stir. Serve with rice.

6u58hp,"Thanks! The best I can do is teach him to like a good rare steak and oh I guess be good to humans, animals, and the earth. 😅 ",2017-08-17 06:03:15
6u58hp,aah but u see a big problem here and in our world is how we treat animals. i hate to kill the mood but in reality most of these steaks (basically majority of meat in the US) comes from animals living in i think pretty poor conditions. i drive past some of these big cow operations and it really is sad especially if i imagine sending my dog there. we are so disconnected from the killing of the animal. i think thats the main problem. im ok with eating meat as long as i know the animal had a nice happy life and went out stress free. respect for the animal. ✌🏼,2017-08-17 06:13:42
6u58hp,"Thank you for saying that! Ah okay, so that initial inspiration to go veggie just kind of faded then? I understand it, it's hard to keep it up, you kind of forgot why you were doing it perhaps? It's also easy to fall into this trap of thinking that you've 'done your bit' for the animals so you can go back to eating meat (I'm not saying that these are the reasons that you went back to it but they're some of the most common from my experience and might be at least a little relevant).
But it's important not to give up on what made you stop eating meat in the first place - these animals, they have the capacity to think, feel, and suffer just as we do, and their lives are simply wasted every year on the multi-billion scale.
It is not my intention to make you feel guilty, or force you to do anything you do not want to do; I am simply aiming to speak out for those who cannot. I hope you reconsider a vegetarian or vegan diet, but either way, thank you for having this conversation with me, I wish you a happy life and plenty of delicious Reddit karma. Peace, friend! ☮️

EDIT: if you're a bit of a foodie then feel free to check out my instagram (instagram.com/willspurgeon11), I occasionally post the vegan meals I cook and they're pretty damn delicious if I do say so myself. It's a myth that you can't have awesome plant-based food, you totally can, and it's honestly easier to cook than meat ever was. Haha sorry I'll shut up now! 💚 ",2017-08-17 19:15:03

ps0ug4,Dummy thicc naan 🥵🥵,2021-09-21 00:10:29
ps0ug4,"1. Yes my Naan is thick as fuck 😅 It was my first time making and I should’ve made them thinner but you live and learn. Still tasted amazing and would recommend!

2. Naan recipe, Adapted from this recipe (http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/16225/fluffy-naan-bread.aspx), I also added some chopped garlic and parsley (ran out of coriander) just before cooking on the pan, then hit it with melted butter at the end.

3. Okay the people have spoken, here is my Curry Recipe:

INGREDIENTS
Chicken Marinade
- 1 cup, Plain Yogurt
- Juice of ½ Lemon
- 3 cloves of Garlic, finely grated
- 1 tbsp, Ginger, finely grated
- 2 tsp Each, Paprika/Cumin/Turmeric/Curry Powder
- ½ tsp, Salt
- 2 tsp, Sriracha
- 6, Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs, cut into bite size pieces
In a bowl, combine all ingredients and marinate for atleast 1 hour, even better for 2-3 hours or even overnight if you want super succulent chicken!

For the Sauce
- 2 tbsp, Vegetable/Canola Oil
- 2 tbsp, Butter
- 2 medium Onions finely diced
- 3 cloves of Garlic, finely grated
- 1 tbsp Ginger, finely grated
- 2 tsp Each, Paprika/Cumin/Turmeric/Curry Powder
- 1 tsp, Ground Red Chili Powder
- 2 tsp, tomato purée
- 1 Can Good Quality crushed tomatoes
- 1 Can Coconut Milk
- Salt to Taste
- Fresh Coriander to garnish

METHOD
In a large pot, heat oil on Medium-High. When hot, add chicken pieces, ensuring not to crowd the pan. (This is important!)

Cook for 2-3 minutes a side, until browned. Make sure you have some nice brown bits at the bottom of your pan! Set aside chicken in bowl.
*The Chicken doesn't have to be cooked through at this stage

In the same pan, add butter and Onions, and cook until soft, translucent and brown. Add Ginger and Garlic, and sautee for 30-45 seconds. (No Longer)

Then add all the spices Fry until fragrant (15-20 seconds, until fragrant).

Add Tomato Sauce, Purée, Ground Red Chili and Sriracha. Simmer for 15-20 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally until Tomato Sauce thickens, and takes on a deep reddish brown colour. (Make sure you get this sauce thick like my naan people!)

Add Chicken and Cocunut Cream, and cook for an additional until mixture is bubbling, glossy, and thick. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Garnish with fresh Coriander (or Parsley) and serve with hot Basmati Rice✌🏻",2021-09-21 07:21:46

ps0ug4,"brah I’m not your dietician 😂 if you’re gna act like an internet gangster at least keep it real. I don’t think tikka masala can really be improved appearance wise, homie did a good job imo. The English muffin naan is a lil wack tho. 

Also I’d never just slap it on the rice like that, but hey I ain’t the chef G

Also how are the impossible burgers? Do they cook well? I like their breakfast patties, and have had the burgers in restaurants, but find myself going for Praegers at the store",2021-09-20 23:26:21

ps0ug4,"Not a man, but you’re welcome 😊

Sure, WaPo can certainly be disappointing at times due to its editorial bias, but the important thing is to apply critical thinking when evaluating any resource and to review multiple sources. (I’m sure you already know this though, as you studied in a field which required research papers). Kundan Lal Gujral—the original restaurant founder—not his grandson) is [widely](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/the-history-of-tandoori-chicken-infographics/articleshow/75203860.cms) recognized as the [modern inventor](https://edtimes.in/how-did-partition-of-india-lead-to-the-development-of-new-food-culture/) of tandoori chicken † and the dish murgh makhani as a way to use up the leftover tandoori chicken, which had a tendency to dry out, in a saucy dish.

† I say modern inventor loosely as there is archaeological evidence of chicken being grilled in tandoor style ovens dating back to the Indus Civilization. The most likely reason he’s credited as the inventor is because Nehru was a fan of the restaurant so foreign dignitaries and other public figures ended up eating there, so his restaurant had the most popular version of the dish.

“Is the dish Pakistani or Indian?” is a question worth considering (don’t think you’re being too pedantic) but as murgh makhani was purportedly invented in and spread from Delhi rather than in Pakistan, I’d say it’s reasonable to consider it an Indian dish rather than Pakistani.

I’m curious, though, that you refer to Gujral as a cook from Pakistan. Considering that the entire region was British India and the Partition of India occurred during the period in which this dish was created (Kundan Lal Gujral fled to Delhi when his province became part of Pakistan), are the migrants who fled newly formed Pakistan still considered Pakistani? And are Punjabi Hindus not considered Indian? I only ask because I’m pinay and there’s a lot of regional differences in Filipino cuisine and languages (as well as regional identity erasure, but that is a whole nother topic).

>	 Just not necessarily a traditional thing done in many

Oh, definitely not, but then again the dish is not that old to begin with. The closest comparison I can think of is maybe Chicago Deep Dish pizza? It was created around the same time as Butter Chicken, requires a specific kind of setup to cook, and isn’t commonly cooked at home but is based on a much older pizza tradition.

g149iw,Doesn’t look amateur to me. Looks professional. Hope you saved a serving for me 😋,2020-04-14 13:18:25
g149iw,"How I make the Alfredo sauce...

Put a teaspoon of olive oil in your skillet. Once it’s heated properly put your minced garlic, 4 cloves, in the OO to bloom your garlic... 15 to 20 seconds, don’t burn it.

Pour a cup and a half of heavy whipping cream in the pan and stir the garlic into the cream. Allow the heavy whipping cream to come to a boil... then add your precooked fettuccine noodles. That will stop your cream from boiling initially. Stir your fettuccine noddles while the cream begins to boil again... once the noodles are reheated turn the stove off and mix in a handful of Parmesan cheese. Stir the cheese into the heavy whipping cream with your pasta fork. If your sauce is too creamy... add more cheese to thicken it up. If your sauce become too thick... add more heavy whipping cream to make it creamier.

Once your Alfredo sauce is the perfect consistency... you have the option of adding additional ingredients like a couple of tablespoons of pesto, maybe some precooked asparagus, or broccoli, and or some chicken bits.👅

No need for butter or any other things some people include.",2020-04-14 17:31:50

g149iw,"This is close to my recipe. I sauté garlic in butter and EVOO until fragrant - low low heat as to not burn. Add heavy cream and bring to a low boil, constantly stirring and add handfuls of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and stir until smooth, not too much at a time to avoid clumping. Continue to stir until thickened and then lower the heat. I season with salt and pepper and fresh basil to taste and add the pasta directly from the water into the sauces. I love doing shrimp and scallops, chicken and mushroom or chicken and asparagus in the sauce too. 

I might have to make some pasta this weekend 🤔😂 this is making me hungry.",2020-04-14 17:39:29

g2nncg,"Well obviously people do use it in a serious tone especially amoungst racists.

&#x200B;

The difference between the two is that one is self demeaning silly joke and the other can be an attack or a joke aimed at someone else.

&#x200B;

If i replied to a post of yours with a line suffixed with the word 'Prick' would you automatically assume it was humour? Probably not ...even if i tried to hide behind the 'oh its just humour' line.

Hopefully, that explains why mine was clearly a silly joke whereas yours could be construed as a joke or it could be a sly little dig/attack.

For those that don't care for my sarcasm or silliness just move along. No need to downvote. Jeez. 🥺

6127gr,So I'm new to making bread stuff. When I got to the second stage of rising (when they were in balls) they rose so much they squished together. Since I have no idea what I'm doing I tried to separate them by cutting cutting around the edges and they super deflated 😱. Any idea what I could have done wrong to make them rise so much? Or what would you have done to then get them out of the pan for the boiling?,2017-03-26 20:19:29

p71cw0,"Wow! Thank you for all the nice comments and awards! 

Little info on this bad boy: 

Sauce - COLES Supermarket rip-off “special” sauce, not 100% the same but close enough i tell ya. 

Bun in the middle - Tip top Burger Thin, toasted lightly in the pan with the patties. Helps cut down the calories a bit and because I couldn’t get a middle bun 🤣

Cheese is a Coles cheddar slice, next time I’ll melt the slice a bit more. Learn as you go!",2021-08-19 02:12:30

When I'm in Berlin, London, Vienna and snag street food at 2am I'm gonna slap my mates on the back for the good call.  But when I take visitors from these places to a taco truck in L.A. dude?

They fucking cry.  They absolutely can't fathom that shit.  I'm sorry but as good as kebabs are, we're talking some SUBSTANTIAL differences there-  doesn't matter where your taste buds grew up.  😆",2020-08-19 17:35:25
ic1ko0,"I’ll be honest a lot of the tex mex places in the states are truly awful, plate after plate of yellow bland food. But get your arse in a semi-authentic place and its the nuts. Best one I ever had was in a gas station in California 🤷‍♂️",2020-08-18 19:06:10
ic1ko0,Hell yes. I don’t have a lot of LA recs (I lived an hour away so not close) bc I moved to SF 5 years ago. But I had really good tacos at El Paladar Oaxaqueno Taco Truck if you’re in West LA! And check out San Diego for burritos 🤤,2020-08-19 03:26:13
ic1ko0,Same. I really need the stuff from a truck or straight up Mexican pizza from Taco Bell. Miss me with that Tex mex or “Mexican” joint that tries way too hard to americanize it or make it super trendy. 🤢,2020-08-19 02:50:16

mn5v09,"Did you like it? I found this to be some kind of pinnacle for me. So I ordered all the stuff (from Whole Foods bc that’s where I can get the best stuff even at a price) and painstakingly executed it to perfection. Then I hated it. I don’t think I did anything wrong. I think the pastry was too sweet? I also felt very confused about whether to baste the filet with mustard or not (I did not bc Ramsay’s recipe on his own site didn’t call for it even though I see him and his chefs do it all the time). Sometimes I think maybe the mustard would have made the difference? I wanna try again sometimes but it’s a damned expensive meal not to love. Y’all doing the mustard? Have you tried it with and without? I’m genuinely interested in results from people that tried both. 

BTW your Wellington looks 😍👌",2021-04-09 10:41:12

wghr7r,"I don’t like Mexican food. I came to visit Mexico during 2 months in April. I had big expectations of Mexican food since I love Taco Bell (I know it’s not the real Mexican food). And I was so disappointed. I’m not gonna say I hated it all. I loved the guacamole. Some burritos and quesadillas were also awesome. But in general everything is so fat, too much meat (makes it too salty) and not enough veggies. I was always removing half of the meat of my plate, asking for more veggies.. but even. When you don’t have a kitchen and you depend on restaurants to find food, it is so hard to find healthy food. My friend that was always skinny took 8kg in 10days . First time I saw him fat. And he was not eating too much. After a time my body was calling for healthy food and when I was asking for a chicken salad, there was more mayonnaise than chicken and salad together in my plate. So after a month and exploring different states, we decided to avoid Mexican places and only go to Italians restaurants or just eating fruits as meals. I’m coming from Belgium so I guess it’s all about culture. But my friends were as dissapointed as me. So it’s funny here to see comments saying « how can you not like Mexican food » 😅",2022-08-08 10:42:18

wghr7r,"That’s a good point, I mean I guess it’s location thing, Mexican food in 95%+ white towns can be DISGUSTING or just not Mexican food at all lol every single rural breakfast diner I’ve been to has a “mexican omelet” which is literally just a fucking omelet with peppers added

One time I visited my friend who lives in rural wisconsin and he couldn’t stop talking about this new and amazing Mexican restaurant that came out over there, and oh lord. The tacos were hard shell with a fucking KRAFT SINGLE inside for cheese, the burritos were just a tube with both sides open and not closed, the chimichangas looked like someone just disemboweled Snarf, and their horchata was some damn iced cow milk with cinnamon sprinkled on top 😑 my Mexican genes were revolted, the whole time my friend and his family were like “yknow this isn’t half bad right!!! I bet it’s close to what you find at home”

The owners and cooks were all white too 😭 I just wish people in these places were more exposed to other people and cultures so they don’t think that sub-prison food was Mexican",2022-08-05 13:34:03

lrs84x,Thank you! I  will 😊 I have so many recipes and pics to share,2021-02-25 21:10:23
lrs84x,Well that’s eerily accurate 🤣😂🤣😂😂 how did you know,2021-02-25 15:09:56
lrs84x,Yes! A good scratch alfredo is really simple and people miss out! The seasonings are what really make it. For this I add the juice of the crawfish tails as I have to buy them frozen when they aren’t in season and other times I like to mix it with a little bit of a marinara sauce to make a “rose” alfredo I call it 😂 it’s like a pink sauce almost 🥴,2021-02-25 04:22:08
lrs84x,Because I told a fb admin on one of their posts that I enjoyed plants and they said do I have anymore plant inspo I’d like to share and my reply was “yes I do. I love sharing my plants on fb when I’m not in fb jail for calling out racist misogynistic trash” 🙃 next thing I know-bam 30 day bid 😂🤣😅🤣,2021-02-25 21:53:37
lrs84x,"It is totally fine to admit you’re wrong when you’re wrong. And you are. Just as I posted a link with multiple recipes, you posted ONE link that is the same as what you called mine-a shitty recipe from a random person.
You’re ignorant “dumb white people” comment shows your true level of ignorance. 
You can have your own belief. I will go by what I was taught from my German grandmother and from the culture I grew up with in Louisiana. 
There are other people on this thread that didn’t care for the recipe or look of it and I can respectfully say that’s cool. But you’re “I am God of alfredo” complex is distasteful and ugly. Enjoy the blocked side ✌🏼",2021-02-25 16:22:18

lrs84x,I’m not “wrong” 🙄 holy hell I literally said I “think”. As stated in my first comment-I call them crawfish. Cheezus 😂,2021-02-25 14:43:05
lrs84x,See I don’t do fish. I have tried oysters once just for the sake of it but yeah no-I’m really big on texture when it comes to food and that just doesn’t work for me 😂 now if you fry it maybe because that alters the texture but yeah fish is a no for me lol,2021-02-25 15:12:50

hud556,"I'm not sure what your version of scones is like, but our biscuits are pretty neutral. They're delicious eaten sweet or savory. Butter, jam, and clotted cream are all delicious toppings for them, just as gravy is. Sometimes I'll use them to make a breakfast sandwich, too. Although, it may be just that your scones are just as neutral, but y'all aren't used to actually eating them with anything savory.


I recall seeing someone from the UK talking about making US biscuits because, although similar to UK scones, there was a slight difference. I don't remember what, though, or perhaps I'm mixing it up with US scones and the UK's version 😂😂😂",2020-07-20 11:10:44

Angry American down voting because I don't like your biscuits and gravy? It's shite and always will be 😂😂😂",2020-07-20 09:21:01
hud556,"Lol. It gets so confusing. If only we could all be on the same page 😂 yeah, your biscuits we call cookies. They can be crunchy and crumbly or soft and chewy. So many kinds of cookies/biscuits. Definitely a sweet treat. I have no idea what a UK cookie would be, though?


An American biscuit is kinda doughy, definitely flaky, but it's different than a pastry. Unless your pastries are different, too 🤣 They have a somewhat crispy exterior with a soft and doughy kind of flaky interior, if that makes sense. Depending on the recipe, they can have a pretty neutral bread flavor to fairly buttery and kinda salty. Some are denser, some are fluffier. They're all very similar, though, to be honest. 


They're also similar to an American scone, but much lighter. American scones are heavier and denser and can also range from sweet to savory. This is all making me hungry 😂 I should try looking up a UK scone recipe and making it to compare. Yep. This is now on my to-do list!",2020-07-20 12:47:12

9cmulp,"Thank you so much! ❤️
 
Yep you got it right, and the process and structure behaves just like regular butter (in my limited experience haha).  When I made my swiss meringue browned butter buttercream, I used 50/50 browned and regular butter.  The browned butter I used contained all the burnt bits so it was extra flavourful!  (If your buttercream recipe calls for shortening though, I'd recommend putting in more % of browned butter)

 I would recommend browning the butter the day before, let it solidify in the fridge overnight, then bring it back to room temp the day you use it.

Happy baking! :D",2018-09-03 21:25:53

I would say though, if you're a novice chief, get a bigger pan/pot, and don't shake above an open flame...and if the oil does catch on fire, remember that grease flames need to be smothered. Water just makes it worse.

Those look amazing though ",2018-06-26 12:04:47

bqvwi3,"I usually wing it every time, but these are the general ingredients! (Consider that every time I make this, I am usually making it for a party)

2 boxes shell pasta, 
2 packs bacon, 
1 block Velveeta,
2 bags sharp cheddar cheese, 
Whole milk,
Salt/Pepper to taste,
Paprika to taste,
Dash of Tobasco,
Dash of mustard powder, 

Cook noodles, set aside. Cook all bacon (cut up) in a large pot - let the pool of grease form in the pot. Remove bacon once cooked, leaving grease in pot. Make a roux (or bechamel?) with the bacon grease by adding flour and milk and mix till smooth, then add Velveeta and cheese to complete the cheese sauce. 

Pour over the noodles, mix, and eat. 🤘

Edit: Rue to Roux because I'm illiterate

113qqaj,"And were the kids not, and I get perhaps not purposely but forgetting to care for an animal or pet, is abusive to the animal or pet, no?

This fashion of parenting, is, what is lacking from the Americas.

A parent who decided to not have a long bout of fighting with the kids to take care of something they wanted and enjoyed but often are forgetting. 🤷🏻‍♀️ tough call for some perhaps.

In my home, because my grandfather was saved from death by a dog in snow he fell asleep in. 

God help one of us kids if we had forgotten to feed or water the dogs for a bit. 

Disciplined, like spanked, all the while hearing a teaching about perhaps having to rely on a dog to feed us one day. 

Even spankings did not make us remember to feed and water the dog or let them out on time.",2023-02-17 04:39:59
113qqaj,"The way you write this, and perhaps I missed something. 

I don’t see the original comment and my take away is their parents did it to punish them purposely.

They got told it was “sold.”

To say they had abusive parents 🤷🏻‍♀️ is a bit far for me.",2023-02-17 04:47:28

c27pl5,"This reminds me of my dad. He always liked to recreate difficult recipes for my mom. It was his way, I think, of showing how much he loved her. She and I were his sous chefs, cleaning up after him, cutting all the vegetables, helping him plate, etc. Sometimes it was frustrating, as Mom and I felt like we were scrubbing endless pots and pans. My dad passed away because of shitty cancer:( I’d give anything to help him make another meal ❤️

Thanks for the award, kind stranger!",2019-06-18 23:50:07

c27pl5,"Ooooooo I like the idea of smashing them and then pan frying. That sounds really good! I have a bunch leftover and I’ll definitely give that a shot! 

For plating purposes, I really wanted this to look “fine dining” style so I tried to take it easy on the portions but really execute every part of the dish close to perfectly. The other thing too is I always read about high end plating using negative space to make dishes look pretty. And my plates aren’t very big so if I’m gonna get negative space I gotta skimp on portion size lol.

I appreciate your feedback though! 👍",2019-06-19 01:27:20

cg298s,"I baked the cake layers 2 days ahead, made the wings same night real quick. Everything else I did overnight. Fresh strawberries and blueberries tossed in sugar is the filling, swiss meringue buttercream mixed with white chocolate ganache for inside and crumb coat. 

Crumb coated the night before. 

Had hubby grab some pure white frosting from the store the morning of for the exterior, iced and painted the flamingo cookie 4 hours before the party. Hence the big indent on the flamingo head. Forgot it was still not set when I was trying to position it 😭

Usually I start a week before and work in steps. Flamingo should have been baked wednesday, iced that day or Thursday so its hard and ready to paint Thursday or friday. Cake is usually fully frosted and ready the night before, decorations are finished by the night before or sooner so all I have left to do is put it together in the morning.",2019-07-21 19:56:41

I got a plate full of miscellaneous pickled vegetables instead 😡. Like carrots and baby corn. 

Also sometimes you order pickles on a burger and get bread and butter pickles. I hate that kind.",2020-07-25 05:38:09

We’re always considered at least a possible playoff contender, even going into seasons looking less than stellar. We’re also a part of one of the greatest current rivalries in football with the Steelers.

My post was simply stating my opinion on what the definition of a grilled cheese is and how any ingredients added besides (cheese, bread & spread) creates a “melt”. To anyone who has a different opinion? That’s alright with me and many people feel the same way. I’m not out here stoking any flames of the circle jerk, maybe a few shit post and dry comments here and there. Most of the time I’m lurking per usual. For what it’s worth, I never expected any of this to happen and I never had any malicious intent.

oia7yz,"Ok, I eye balled it and haven’t made these since last year, so remember that everything is to taste! 

I know I put a whole jalapeño cut up (with seeds), strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, sugar, and a bit of lemon juice in a pot and brought to a boil essentially. Then I transferred it to a blender and strained it through a sieve. 

You can use really any berry - raspberry’s good too! Add as much or as little jalapeño as you’d like :) I think it was just a few pinches of sugar. I may have added a dash of salt too, who knows. 😂😂😅

The croquettes were straight goat cheese rolled into a ball, dipped in egg then panko - do this process twice if you want a thick crust. It’s all up to you! Put them in the freezer for like 30 min to an hour before frying. 

I wish I could say I owned a deep fryer, but I just fill a stock pot with a good amount of oil so that they can be completely submerged! Fry till golden brown. Make sure there’s enough panko and they are cold enough or else the goat cheese will yeet out of the croquettes 😂",2021-07-12 14:34:42

zkev8i,"OP, omgoodness. You gave me inspo the other day when you posted this. I just want to tell you how it went down as kind of an amateur home chef lmao.  Not knocking your instructions or anything but just my dumb ass probably not at the same skill level as you. 

Okay so, first off all I probably messed up the roast. It had a great sear, but I was confused about the temp 🤣 I did 350 for 30 min so it was still a bit tough (maybe the cut I bought?) But I realize slow and low at 250 was probably a better choice if I had the time. I'm slow and literally started prepping at 5pm and ate just before 10pm (ngl with some smoke and dance breaks in between). I don't recall ever cooking a roast in my life so taking this one as a learning experience 😅 I cooked it to temp and all but still a bit chewy, so I don't think it had time to tenderize.

THE GRAVY. Probably the best thing I ever tasted. So here I think my skill is not as good as yours and I don't think I chopped the onions small enough. I ended up blitzing them with an immersion blender which after they cooked down was perfect. I quarterd the mushrooms since everyone was mad about it lol. I used Apothic Red (I think you said you used Apothic Dark) and the wine flavor is amazing. I know there was a whole topic about people who don't want to cook with wine. I like wine but don't drink it so I gave the bottle to my roommate to drink after 2 splashes into the gravy. 

I made my roommate make the mashed potatoes since I'm on keto but I wanted a taste. Omg the gravy is amazing. I'm ruining my diet by eating the leftover potatoes with the gravy lmao. Idk how exactly he makes his mashed potatoes but I know he uses sour cream in the mix. It is heaven. It's my fault idk how to properly cook a roast lmao but dat GRAVY is everything. Thank you  again for posting. The onions seemed like overkill in the moment (I know you said you love onions and I do too) but it's amazing. The onion/garlic smell still lingers in the house and I ain't even mad.

Edited multiple times for typos cos I typed this on my phone.",2022-12-15 12:30:21

zkev8i,"Yaaaas! Thank you again. I'll make it again and do better with the roast 🙏 my roommate even suggested using a crock pot next time which I feel would at least shift the blame if it didn't come out cooked correctly 💀 I still want to get better at cooking it on my own, I feel like that's a skill I should have by my age lmao. 

Idk if my knives are trash or my chopping skill just ain't it. Or a combo of both. I really did just roughly dice them but my immersion blender got like it's second use this year so it probably felt like a hero. The texture was perfecto 👌",2022-12-16 07:06:56

Last night I was watching [David Chang's new Netflix series, Ugly Delicious](https://www.eater.com/2018/2/23/17043556/ugly-delicious-season-1-netflix-guide), and he had some very thoughtful things to say about ""authenticity"".

Quote from [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/david-chang-combats-culinary-purity-netflix-ugly-delicious) about the series:

> What makes “Ugly Delicious” compelling, ultimately, is Chang’s commitment to rejecting purity and piety within food culture. “I view authenticity like a totalitarian state,” Chang declares, in the show’s first episode, adding, “It’s not that I hate authenticity, it’s that I hate that people want this singular thing that is authentic.” In food culture, particularly American food culture, the concept of authenticity is wielded like a hammer: This pizza, made with San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella di bufala and a yeast-risen dough, blistered in an ultra-hot wood-fired oven for less than a minute, is authentic; that pizza, ordered on the Domino’s Pizza Now™ mobile app, dressed with toppings that arrive at a franchise location pre-sliced in a vacuum-sealed bag, passed through an industrial conveyor-belt oven, is not. The problem with such rigid categorizations, according to “Ugly Delicious,” is, for one thing, creative stagnation.

On the other hand... as the show also points out... before you can honestly alter something, you need to first understand where it came from.  To paraphrase and apply that to this conversation, to start out making carbonara with bacon, Parmasian, and cream without having first tried it with pecorino, guanciale, and without cream, you don't have a proper baseline to compare against.",2018-03-18 12:25:49
858123,"Why don't **you** just make it? And please make sure to post a picture of it on this subreddit.

pwhd1f,"fun fact i didnt use a cook book or video, i looked up the main ingredients - guajillo and ancho ( de arbol is above my spice tolerance) and kind of free-styled from there (added a bell pepper, fresh tomatoes and adobo peppers for my consommé etc) and did what felt right to me... once i'm done editing ill upload it on YT and perhaps you might stumbled upon my version of this dish- who knows 😄

edit: i meant chipotle peppers**",2021-09-27 21:24:18

I'm trying to eat more ecologically friendly seafood (Mussels ftw) instead of carnivorous fish but God.  I swear all the squid in the US is heavily fried and rubbery.  You can count the times in my life on one hand where I ate some that didn't either feel unhealthy or queasy.  But I know it's possible so speak up Asia!

Edit: Octopus off-limits though.  Not calling Squid stupid, but you gotta draw an intelligence line somewhere.  *proceeds to order a burger* 🙄",2021-04-09 19:27:23

kwcfz5,"I know it’s a restaurant in a breathtaking tourist place but that shouldn’t be more expensive than 10 euros per pizza. If it’s more, run away.

In normal restaurant (non-tourist) it’s about 4 euros for cheese pizza (margherita) and about 5 to 10 euros for different toppings pizzas.

An advise from an Italian friend 😉",2021-01-13 14:14:27

p5enfd,"I mean that's not even a pizza dough it's just bread and it's burnt. The pepperoni is obviously super cheap super low quility and it's burnt. The cheese well to call that a cheese is an offence to the 7000 years we have been making cheese on this planet and it's burnt. 

The grease I mean where do you even start with how much grease there is all over that thing. I wear a 42 inch waist in my trousers I'm certainty not shy about eating a high calorific dinner. But it's like they took a ladle of oil from a deep fat fryer that's not been cleaned or changed in months and just poured it in on there. My heart hurts just looking at it.

This is to pizza what a ""chocolate coffee crunch frappachino ® blended beverage"" is to coffee. Sure if this nasty ass cheap stuff is ""foodporn"" to you enjoy it (maybe see a doctor after though). But don't call it a pizza call it what it is say for example it could be called a  ""processed meat of unknown provenance with coconut and vegetable oil based cheese analogue on a flat dough served with a grease gravey""",2021-08-16 18:14:37

There was this place called Golden Caiman or something that was like a super traditional fast food type sushi place but i heard it came under new ownership and the quality dropped.  

There’s actually a pretty surprising amount of sushi in the Columbia area, another place i went and enjoyed a lot was Tsunami right in the Vista area downtown.  But i might’ve enjoyed their half off sake more than anything else, it was college after all 😅",2019-08-09 00:07:41

Seriously. That's a fantastic meal. I eat ramen all the time. You just need to fine tune your technique.",2020-10-12 22:42:05
j9rww0,Yes 🥺,2020-10-12 19:28:13
j9rww0,"Of course I know how to cook, LOL. I have entire recipe books that I’ve cooked my way through. I’ve just never been very happy with the results.

I find that most recipes don’t have enough seasoning, and I’m not a good enough cock to know what, or how much more, to add.

I’m content enough to eat toast, cereal, or gluten free Ramen; But sometimes it would be nice to feed my boyfriend a nice meal, or entertain a guest without getting catering 🤷🏾‍♀️",2020-10-14 05:35:40
j9rww0,Same. No food shaming! 😁,2020-10-12 20:18:42
j9rww0,"Thank you for this recipe. It is VERY appreciated. It also seems very easy for someone as lazy as myself. I will DEFINITELY Be using this recipe if we are ever able to attend pot lucks again. 

Unfortunately, I probably should’ve mentioned that I can’t eat gluten, or soft cheese, or pork😬

When I mentioned the ramen earlier, its actually a bastardized form using gluten free noodles, Campbell’s pho broth, and sriracha. 

I loooooooove meatballs though🤤 

I JUST discovered that I can buy premade veal, lamb, or beef meatballs and have been enjoying my own meatball subs
And middle eastern wraps all week. 

The spread in this image is droolworthy, and I would be INCREDIBLY proud to host my own spread like that one day. 

If anyone has any tried and tested lasagna recipes that I can do with my food allergies, PLEASE share.

If I ever get a chance to make the lasagna recipe that you shared, I will definitely be sharing a picture with you ☺️.",2020-10-12 20:21:54

gs1tou,"Definitely respect your personal decisions but if you’re thinking about going back to meat, bacon would be a great place to start! Very easy and very tasty. 

Smithfield thick cut in a black package with the resealable top is my favorite. No oils or anything needed. Just put it in a frying pan med/high heat, let one side cook fully then flip and voila 😃

I flip mine at ~80% done and flip back and forth so that I can keep a closer eye on it but I like my bacon less crispy than most. 

Cheers!",2020-05-28 19:11:54

tzrocu,"This no-bake Cheesecake has the best texture: It is light, smooth and so creamy. Paired with the rich cream cheese filling, the Biscoff flavor comes alive! It is such a crowd-pleaser recipe.  
I created an instructional recipe video if you're interested, or if you prefer to learn visually.

It's also a big part of the reason why any ""fast food"" type pizza place (e.g. Little Caesar's, Papa John's, Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc) is going to be noticeably worse: they all use standard electric ovens. Nothing like getting a soggy pizza with rubbery cheese and a doughy crust 🤮",2021-02-27 07:29:59

sz2qnq,"I've been working on this flatbread recipe for a couple months. I use my cast iron skillet to cook:

3/4 cup cashew, oat milk, water or any kind of milk really... I used cashew for this batch 
1/2 tbsp yeast
1/2 tsp sugar
1/4-1/2 tsp salt - I use kosher
2 1/4 bread flour (all purpose works too) 
2-3tbsp olive oil
Set aside 1/4 cup for kneading

Heat the liquid to around 100-110 degrees. I use the microwave about 1 min

Add sugar and yeast, stir and allow to proof. I wasn't paying attention and mine proofed almost 20 minutes, it quadrupled and had a lot of foam 😂

Add flour and salt; mix until incorporated enough to squish into a ball.

Add any remaining flour from the bowl and the final 1/4 cup to a counter, table or any flat surface and knead 3-5 minutes. You can add more flour if it's too sticky (humid climates), just add tbsps at a time and work into the dough until smooth and elastic. 

Cover and let rise until doubled. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Punch it down, roll into a log and cut into either 4 or 6 pieces.. depending on how big you want them. 

Heat up your skillet - medium high - you want it hot. If you don't have a cast iron, you can use a regular skillet. No oil is used, we want some dry, dark brown toasty spots to form 🤤

I roll out 1 dough ball at a time with a rolling pin. Flatten it with your hand, then roll from the center, out towards the edge. Turn, roll, flip, roll.. until you have the size you like. 

Add to the pan and watch for small bubbles to start forming. Flip the pita. It will only be lightly colored, but we want that. Cook this side until it starts to get dark brown/black spots, then flip it again. 

It may or may not puff up like a balloon.. we want it to because the steam makes it oh so chewy... but it's not the end of the world if it doesn't.

I keep my pitas stacked before serving so the heat and steam continues to keep the breads moist and warm. 

If you want to make a turkish style flat bread, only cut 2-4 dough pieces so they are nice and big. Cover both sides with butter as soon as they come off the skillet. 

You can roll crushed garlic and cilantro into the dough, then butter after cooking for a garlic naan style. 

This recipe is pretty forgiving.",2022-02-23 15:05:26

When I was in like 6th grade, the school would let you sign up for these little volunteer jobs to help people around the school (hall monitor, library helper, etc.) and I signed up to help in the cafeteria. A lot of it was stocking the big round cans in the freezer, but some of it was also helping the lunch ladies prepare a portion of lunch like the fruit cups or whatever. 

I distinctly remember one time where they were serving beef stew, and so I had to prepare that to be heated up. It came in a big can, and when it came out it was all slimy and can-shaped... looked like a wet cylinder of fruitcake that I then had to mash up to be heated and served 🤢",2020-12-10 20:26:44

The net will back up a lot of what I said but unfortunately it won't back up any of yours ya angry goose. 

 I can't imagine what it's like to sit there and tell somebody you dont know they haven't lived and worked where they lived and worked.. and mean it too. Lmao so crazy 🤣.

It was amazing how many kids filled his line and were willing to try better food options, instead of their usual pizza, burger, or cafeteria mystery meal. Sometimes kids will surprise you in a good way.  If there is enough demand for a change, it can be pushed for.  You’d have to get the parents involved and interested.

How'd you make it so big, what's the portions, what's the meat? Is that a carrot, is that jam, if so what's your favorite? did you cook the breaded part first then stuff it? Did you bake it all together at once? Lol no recipe is in the comments :P like I said it's a compliment bc it looks so good, but annoying you won't just say how it's made 😘",2022-12-12 21:41:42

igwydf,"Again? I'm a different person, nutsack. And yes. My uncle has used pellets for years and vastly prefers what I make in my reverse flow offset, he asks for it every time he comes down. But his lifestyle won't allow for one. The smoke that comes from seasoned wood splits is genuinely different in composition than processed pellets. All smoke is not the same, and woods that carry different amounts of oils will give different flavors and results. Pellets are compressed sawdust and will not retain the oils that splits do.

But sure dude, guess I'm just talking out of my ass 😂

They are correct that it is the traditional way but it's also difficult, expensive, and time consuming. Really good offsets routinely run over $1500 and eat wood like a fat kid at a cake convention. They are also very time-intensive and require fucking with the dampers for temperature control whereas most pellet grills do it through an app interface you can monitor from your couch.

They also don't have the capacity offset smokers do.",2020-08-27 02:22:13

rojk5w,"Not correct 😂😂 have you heard of personal preference? Charring, (not burnt) brings mad flavor. Just so you know there isn’t one singular way to eat a steak",2021-12-26 19:33:16
rojk5w,"Some people have never tried it and just have this weird hangup on why they don't like it lol 

But hey if someone wants to cook a steak and never truly understand how deliscious it can be, I guess its their loss 🤷‍♀️",2021-12-26 23:07:12

qnn2uj,"Thank you! Honestly I just kind of made it up as I went along as used up the ingredients in the fridge. But I’ll give you my best guesses! 
(also I made a LOT of soup, you may want to dial it back a little lol) 

5 medium carrots cut into small pieces 

4 celery stalks chopped 

1 red bell pepper chopped 

2 yellow onions chopped 

2 cloves garlic 

3 chicken breasts 

Approx 8 cups chicken broth, homemade or store bought 🤷🏼‍♀️

Like 2/3 of a bag of fusilli pasta lol 

Salt 

Pepper 

2 bay leaves 

Chili flakes 

Chives 

Thyme leaves / powdered thyme 

Smoked paprika 

Onion powder 

Fresh chives 

Some olive oil/butter 


First I chopped all my veggies. Then I heated my pan with some oil. Salt and pepper the chicken breasts then fry on med/high heat just until they get some golden colour on both sides. They don’t need to be cooked all the way through. Then set them aside leaving the oil and browned chicken bits in the bottom. Add in your chopped veggies and chili flakes, cook until they start to soften a little bit. I didn’t have much oil left in the pan so I added a bit of butter to finish cooking the veg. Then add your chicken stock and chicken breasts back in. Add the bay leaves. Bring it to a boil, then simmer about 20 mins until the veggies are soft and your chicken is cooked through. You have two options here, personally I boil the pasta in a separate pot to keep the broth from getting starchy. OR you can throw it in the soup while everything is boiling for the final 8-10 mins (or whatever the package directions say on the type of pasta you use). Take the chicken out, shred it, add it back to the pot. Then add the pasta if you boiled it separately. Then time to season, salt pepper, thyme (I used both leaves and powder), and I only used a little bit of the smoked paprika, it’s a strong flavour and best in small quantities. I topped it with a bunch of fresh chives and I think that’s it! Oh and remember to remove the bay leaves",2021-11-05 23:41:10

I’ll try anything, if I don’t like it, I don’t. Case in point, green beans. 🤷‍♂️",2023-04-04 20:29:06
