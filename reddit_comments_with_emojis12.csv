haucpf,"That is so cool about Rick astley giving a freakin platinum!! Also I imagine trying to explain it to IRL people is not all that simple. 

Oh my god so sorry about the lump. That sounds scary a hell. Fingers crossed its something super benign. 

Funny story about the time my doctor sent me straight over to the ER. It happened in 2009. 

I went in for a med check up and becuase my stomach had been bothering me. Dr sent me to the ER because she thought I might have appendicitis. Super urgent and all that. Scared and planning on surgery.  A cat scan and lab work later. It turned out I needed to poop. 🤦 😆. 

The dr said something like I had an incredible amount of stool backed up. Of course my mom then told everyone she could that I was full of shit lol",2020-06-17 19:45:18

Wow 2k upvotes and an award! I never thought my best comment would be about toilet paper 😄",2020-03-13 17:36:24

fi2zjs,I have a single role left 😅,2020-03-13 17:56:28
fi2zjs,"I braved Costco yesterday (they had been out of toilet paper for four days at this point), but not to be that asshole who buys 30 cases of bottled water (although they only had about 10 cases left when I was there). We have a 2yo with feeding issues who basically subsists on a pouch-based diet. And although she eats applesauce with at least two meals per day, I only took two boxes of applesauce pouches, because wtf is the next mom with a picky eater supposed to do if I buy all 50 cases of applesauce pouches? 

I showed up at Target when they opened this morning - just in case! - because I am running low on contact lens solution, and was lucky enough to get the last goddamn bottle of lens solution in the store. And the last box of nighttime pullups for our son (at least Target still had a few boxes of diapers - both local grocery stores had tumbleweeds running down the baby/paper goods aisles). 

I was lucky. The same Costco had a line an hour long just to get in the door today, and a Target in another part of town had a line around the corner and down the street by the time the store opened this morning. We’ve only had low single digit confirmed cases in our state so far (although obviously it will get worse). 

I’m torn, because I work in supply chain, and I know this ship will get righted once the panic subsides, but I’m also married to a doctor and know how terrifying a 3% mortality rate is. 

TLDR: People have lost their goddamn MINDS. But probably for a decently good reason. 🤷‍♀️",2020-03-14 04:56:03

fi2zjs,"Good job Costco 🤦‍♂️ how about a little rational limits on certain items.  Same for all big retail stores.  We all need to use caution, no  panicking.  Be smart use best practices, wash your hands, no face touching, hand shaking,  keep a safe distance etc.  Unlike the the Clown Prince we call ""Mr. President"" and his band of geniuses at that  Trump rally disguised as a press conference.

fi2zjs,"I walked by a lady in the grocery store a few days ago in the toilet paper aisle (the shelf only had a few packages left) who said to me, “I really am legitimately out of toilet paper!” I laughed because I didn’t think her just having TP was bad..

It seems like some of the people that just happen to be at the TP aisle at the right place at the right time are feeling judged now. It’s a crazy world. 

I hope you’re able to find some TP soon. The shower isn’t a terrible option.. I mean, it’s better than poopy pants. 🤷‍♀️",2020-03-13 18:44:55

l77fdv,"I know this corruption isn't new, but what's going on right now with GameStop and exchanges like Robinhood is absolute collusion with market manipulators and goes against fair market practices blatantly. Please spread the awareness to reddit and elsewhere. I'm not financially involved in any of this but this behavior is 100% against the law and needs to be held accountable.

Whether you have an account or not, you are aloud to participate however you'd like. Please rally together and stand up for the layman against these hedge-fund extortionists.

Robinhood Financial LLC

Menlo Park, CA 94025
United States

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them. 

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

I'm so sorry you had to go through this. I pray you will find the strength to carry on, to continue her legacy. I hope you will find the guidance you need to settle your legal and financial affairs. She was so lucky to have a man like you to love her in health and sickness.

I won't compare my loss to yours, but when I was hurting and breaking down at random, a friend once said that pain is like a ball in a box, randomly bouncing around, and from time to time, it will hit a button that triggers all the tears and hurt. I hope when it happens, you will be able to remember her with happiness. So much love to you ♥️",2020-03-04 18:39:42

i3izcv,">“Proven” right 😂😂

Yes, since data and research proves it.

>so then large gatherings of schools wouldn’t have an impact either correct?

No. Did you even read my comment or the article I linked?

The health official literally explains why cases at the protests are low.

It's outside, distance can be maintained, exposure duration between people is short and a lot of people wore masks.

None of these 4 are true for schools. People are inside, distance can't be maintained, constantly exposed to the same people and not a lot of people wear masks.

> Seriously just use you brain and tell me straightfaced millions of people gathering across the country doesn’t have an impact on cases. I actually want you to say the words

Scientific research proves that cases didn't spike because of the protests.

If protests cause spikes, then please point out the spike in daily new cases in New York: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/new-york/

They had massive protests. Where is their spike?",2020-08-04 16:15:40

t3osvy,"I am happy for you but this is not fair. Your dad is here with your family, while some 18 year old guy was to forced fight in this war. I don't care if he was somewhere else but he should have fought too. If young inexperienced men are forced to fight this war so should every other citizen too.

I am sorry I shouldn't have said ill about your father. Every person deserves to be away from bloody war and with their family. But I am disheartened for those citizens with no choice. Those young martyrs had aspirations in life too which were other than being labeled as a brave martyr. They literally were given no choice in this war. Even women had a choice to leave. But young men didn't. This is so unfair. And noone will talk about them. Those men are death trapped between some politicians power tripping and the laws of a country. And all people will do is send ♥ emoji when they give their life. This all is fucked.

This world is a fucked up place.",2022-03-01 11:33:57

I didn’t do that because I had put them in my coat, and I honestly forgot about them.”

fqwind,"Sending some prayers your way my friend. Or if you’re not religious, good thoughts and internet hugs and all that good jazz 😊

Even if his test comes back positive, odds are very good that your father will be perfectly fine. I have to keep reminding myself that higher risk doesn’t equal automatic death sentence. It’s so easy to get overwhelmed by the media and worry and stress and, well, everything. I have older parents in their 60s and 70s with health issues that put them at a higher risk, so I know the stress you’re feeling. I wish I lived closer to them, but glad they’re not near me atm since I’m in NJ and it’s getting pretty bad here, but also just wishing I was there with them and not here...

It’s all going to be fine. We all got this.

Also please enjoy some pics of my pets to take your mind off things. Their cuteness is a formidable opponent to worry, even if only for a moment.

17xjfyu,"I found a stray cat this way. I got back in my car from night class and was about to drive off when I suddenly noticed the cat on the floor in front of the passenger seat. Much of my days back then were generally full day of work, then class, then home so I didn’t even have a good idea where or when he got in there. Since he could have been from anywhere, I didn’t want to put him back out and opted to take him home until I could get him to a cat rescue as my mom was adamant about no more cats. It took me a whole year to place him. I WAS hoping that my mom would give in by then, but my uncle who was working at a pet store found a nice sucker - oops, I mean customer - who was interested in another cat. Also met us in a Jaguar to pick him up, so we felt confident that she could afford to take good care of him. She even got in contact later asking for his vet records, I had neutered him right after I found him to make both holding on to him and placing him easier. I got another update about a year later how he was now a spoiled, fat cat (easy to believe because he would literally eat anything in sight - even gave us a scare by stealing a piece of chocolate once 😬). He was a true r/oneorangebraincell. That bastard cost me hundreds of dollars and I still didn’t get to keep him 🥲.",2023-11-17 21:42:55

My old man (12 y/o tiny tabby) had unfortunately been traumatized at the vet in his harness and I couldn't turn it into a positive thing after that experience. He's been depressed ever since. We bought a stupid fancy stroller this year, where it's just like a car seat in the sense that the basket is a carrier that detaches and clicks into the stroller. He absolutely loves it, I think he still misses being out of the carrier outside, but it's increased his quality of life tremendously! Car rides don't always end at the vet anymore! I highly recommend it, plus people are always shocked when they see kitties in it! 😂",2023-11-17 18:09:56

17xjfyu,"It's absolutely my true pleasure! They're a part of the family! Their quality of life is soooo important and we can very easily do small things to always improve that! We are currently figuring out how to make an official catio, cuz the contractor wanted 30 grand to screen in our 8x10 deck...🤦 So we put up a ""ghetto catio"" which is a screened in pop up tent on the deck and taped it down so they are protected! But the tent was $100 and the tape was 10, and they spend at least an hour every day outside in the sun! They scream at us on rainy days, we let them out, but they always get mad when they get wet 😂 Working on making it permanent! 

(In case someone reads this and considers it: We had to sit with them when we first put it up with the squirt bottle and squirt them and bring them inside if they scratched the flimsy screen. Train them to not rip it up. We do sit outside with them and the time they are ever alone out there is when I'm in our kitchen and can watch them through the window while I'm working.)",2023-11-17 19:09:08

I thought finding a working VCR would be the hard part, but I was wrong... I wanted each tape to be on its own DVD, but the files the VHS to DVD program captured were huge! Gigabytes and gigabytes per tape. It took some extra compressing, and days worth of hours...

But we cannot judge by this photo that Prince Andrew was part of it. This is the photo he has been trying to get the original of to see if it has been photoshopped because he claims no memory (which is possible-we all have memory moments😂) I personally could say I have met loads of famous people in my life- but I doubt they’d remember me. But the more interesting thing is, where is the original? It does seem more plausible that epstein aligned himself with the prince to try and have some sort of protection. Who knows?

9cmazx,"So there was a local restaurant where I live owned by this famous Country singer. Like it’s literally called [Famous Country Singer’s] Bar & Grill. And because he’s a very famous singer he had a lot of pictures with other famous people on the walls. It was like a thing there. They’d get the famous friend to sign it and they’d frame it in the same wooden frame and hang it on the wall. So my brilliant and funny father got a family picture of ours and had it printed in black and white and framed in a wood frame to match and signed it “From the [Tysonvictor] family” with a weird scribbly signature like the others. He went to the restaurant (with a small electric screw driver in his pocket) with a friend with the sole intention to get it put up without any of the employees knowing. He found a good spot and had his friend lookout (oh also my dads a 50 year old grown ass man when he did this) and they actually got the picture drilled into the wall (the other pics were framed and drilled in with two screws through the frame as well). It’s stayed there for about 2 years all the way up until my dad was telling the story and someone who heard it had a daughter that worked there and he told his daughter who told her boss and they found it and took it down. It was so epic while it lasted and we learned our lesson... never tell strangers about the joke. Now we have 3-4 similar jokes put up around town and no one will ever know. I love my dad lol. 

Imgur isn’t wanting to cooperate but I’ll post the picture of the picture if I can get it to work.

kic0ea,"As an ortho assistant for 7 years, I hear this EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! 

honestly, just wear the damn thing. Also ask your Doc for a lingual bar (or permanent retainer) it helps, too. 

Tip: if you do lose your retainer or they stop fitting due to non wear, just go to any ortho office and ask them to make new ones. They're generally inexpensive (every place I've ever worked they're roughly $50 each, upper/lower and then maybe a $25 office fee) sometimes if there is minor spacing issues they can do what they refer to as 'finger-dontics' and hold the space closed with finger pressure (obvs only if the space is tiny!) And then glue the lingual bar to the back of your teeth and it works to keep the space shut with the help of the clear, plastic retainer. 

Please, wear your damn retainer. Or don't come back years later 2 months from your wedding freaking out that you need straight teeth in 6 weeks! 😂",2020-12-23 02:22:19

I know the N95 masks are to be reserved for doctors, but if your parents are over the age of 60-65 their odds of ending up seriously ill or dying are way higher. Majority of deaths in a bunch of countries are this category, up to 50% in some countries, and airplanes are petri dishes. Treat your air travel like your going to a hospital w/ covid patients, as you getting sick is just as big of a problem for them as it is for you. As long as you guys keep the virus from entering your nose/mouth you'll be fine, and N95 is the best way to do that. You'll be good man, just suit up and it should be smooth sailing. 👍",2020-06-28 18:04:06

8lfwjv,"This right here ☝️

I was a  band geek too, and wouldn't have had it any other way. My mom had me make a choice when I was a kid, and that was 'play football, or play trombone', and I chose the trombone. My instrument was an old Conn that my uncle gave me, and I played it until the finish was worn completely through. My mother couldn't afford either of those activities, so it wouldn't have mattered which one I chose, but something about music always drew me towards it. 

When my teacher (who was short on tuba players) asked me if I wanted to switch, I jumped at the chance, selfishly knowing that I would always be first chair, and would always get the better parts. I rushed home and told my mom, and she was pretty happy about the switch, but knew she couldn't ever afford to buy me a tuba to practice on her teachers salary. I had a tuba to play while I was at school, but as for home practice, I was s.o.l. I stayed after school a lot, in a practice room, making sure my technique was flawless, and that my tone was buttery smooth. Eventually, my teacher explained to my mother that I needed my own instrument, and that no matter what she said, he was going to help her get me one. She would have never asked for any assistance, and would have been too embarrassed to agree, but he insisted, and within a month, I had my own tuba. 

Band trips were always awesome, contests were a blast, and it really instilled in me the value of having a group in sync with  each  other, being led into battle with a director with the best ear I've ever seen. I played so much and practiced so hard that eventually I got to play with the city philharmonic, and was offered a scholarship to college.

I can say that band completely changed my life, and even though I rarely play anymore, it taught me music, which made learning to play guitar a lot easier, and helped me tune my ear to better recognize what was listening to. 

People like this one, I hope they receive the finest things life has to offer for as long as the live, because the things they do for other people are beyond spectacular, they're *life changing*.

8lfwjv,"Are you assuming he has a lot of learning to do on the basis of he’s young and not to make the same mistakes you did? such as choosing to buy a musical instrument and go hungry, instead of feeding your nourishment to maintain healthy livelihood so you could at least enjoy music even if you couldn’t afford to play it? Or to commit misdemeanor petty theft crimes like stealing neighbors property by stealing their fruit so you could play guitar, classical guitar, through college? 

Speaking of which you’re pretty lucky man, not only did the schools I went to have music programs, I dreamed of playing an instrument but never was given the attention I needed to be able to partake in such an extravagant hobby, once growing older I wasn’t able to be lucky enough to go to college, let alone finish high school, I had to work immediately at 16 drop out of high school to be able to pay rent, college? No, I got my ged at the age of 30 though, sounds like you lived a life of privilege compared to myself,  I feel you were lucky just as you say the original poster was also, my point of saying any of this? 

See how this works? See what I did there? You’re experience should’ve given you the ability to foresee such a response though

Nobody wants to hear struggles of someone, there’s no comparing of anyone’s perception of reality to another, you say OPs spoiled, I say you were, someone guaranteed will have it worse then us 3 combined and so on so forth... the pure fact that we have the option of even having the simple ability to communicate on social media like this means we’re well off compared to the rest of the world who wouldn’t even think or have the option of even knowing what it’s like to sit in the comfort of a warm bed being able to speak your mind over a mobile device without fear or life threatening recourse.... 

it’s as far or deep as you want to take it..... think before you pass judgement, or give an unwanted opinion on a sincere post of a son paying homage in reflection. 

You may be older but it doesn’t entitle you wiser.

-An opinion isn’t particularly noteworthy, even if you feel it’s a good opinion based on experience, especially when it’s unrequested.

But,

-Life isn’t fair, close to nothing is, unfair things happen everyday, to everyone...

p4iz36,"So sad to see someone with this much passion and hope for their job to just be tossed aside and have their dreams crushed. Sadly, most of corporate America functions like this. It doesn’t matter how much work you put in or how much of your life you give up, they will always take it for granted. I feel like this happens a lot to people who have been brought up by working class parents(like myself). The whole notion of “go above and beyond if you want to get noticed” or “If you don’t give it all you got than how will your boss notice you?” just seems like corporate propaganda to squeeze the most out every employee. Just my thought though 🤷🏽‍♂️",2021-08-15 05:50:37
p4iz36,"Here’s the truth of it. At the end of the day the only reason people get jobs is for money. If we could all survive and take care of our homes and families without a job I’m sure almost everyone would do it. I don’t mean volunteer work of course that’s a whole Different subject. But so many companies convince themselves we work hard for them because we love our jobs. And if you have a job or career that you love that’s great. But many people settle and for some it works and for others it doesn’t. But I always hate it when management asks “what are your goals here?” Or other similar questions. My goal is simple. I want to make money to live a comfortable life. I believe at the end of the day that’s everyone’s goal. But as soon as you say “money” every higher ups asshole snaps shut and they try to change to topic real quick. Or some managers try to act like you’re being greedy. Like “why do you think I’m here?” “Why do you think I kill myself at this job and try to stand out above others?” Its not because my goal is to make the owners more money. Its to make myself more money. Maybe that does make me greedy, but I’ve spent too many years doing the work of 5 people and being told “you really didn’t impress us this year. You were average” and then having to smile and accept that. While some lazy sack of shit sits on his ass and works slower than everyone and he’s paid the same as me. 
Phew. Sorry If I got a little too aggressive. This topic has been a sore spot for me because I’ve also been taken advantage of at my jobs. Even my current job. In the last year we’ve had multiple people quit or get fired and we’ve been short staffed like most places now. We’ve had many long shifts and not enough people to do the work. I’m always looking for something that pays more but it seems like unless you’re friends with someone in the company you have to get lucky. Currently my boss says they’re trying to make the pay fair.

Politics is the reason that we can never have true peace in our lives because everything we hear was passed from the filter of politics so we can never hear what's actually true and what people actually think. I just really wanted to say that no one wants war in their lives and most certainly no one deserves to live in that situation so live peacefully and love. Peace✌,2020-01-09 07:37:57

But this shit going on makes me so ashamed to be an American.

My personal condolences to the Iranians killed by my warmongering leaders. 

Our president, put a gun into your hands and called you weak until you were violent, and blamed you. 

My heart goes out to you. My soul goes out to you. It upsets me so much to see all of this conflict. 

Innocent people should not die for an agenda. 
We are all one race, Human. 
We should love and care for each other and be able to stand on even ground despite religion or country of origin.",2020-01-08 20:38:58

I was a part of it for a while, if I read something on Reddit I just took it as fact, I thought Reddit was like the ultimate reality almost. Kinda scary now I see it from an outside perspective. I think using other apps like tiktok and twitter gave me that broader perspective. 

And yeah, Reddit is 100% controlled by the government's, they'll do whatever they're told. I got a permanent lifetime ban from the league of legends sub Reddit because I made a joke about there being lies about COVID. I frequented that sub for 10+ years and they just banned me for a tiny half joking comment about COVID. Apparently that's a global rule across all subreddits.

126xo3m,"I remember my Nana doing her morning exercise. She’d put her arms in the air in a stretch, then bend down and touch the floor. 20 reps. We would walk wherever we went, in beautiful Sauganash, IL.  She lived to 98 and one day. She raised me where my mother could not.  Nana soothed and comforted me🌺
I wish I had seen more of her after I went away to University. I got caught up in myself. That’s my sole regret. I have three GDs of my own, and we are together a lot.  Young people don’t seem as selfish these days. Hanging with your old Nana is a learning experience.",2023-03-31 07:53:11

I have never met another black person that sunburns. The first time I got sunburn we were actually SHOCKED because we didn’t even know that could happen! Didn’t even know how to treat it.

No one cares in the Corporate world about mistakes like this, no one cares if you mess up the grammar on your tinder page. But feel free to basque in your smugness on Reddit because you are the grammar police.

abx582,"It's up to you, of course, but the anxiety about it you have now + the panic attack then is probably less awful than dragging out the anxiety you have now for 10 more years 
...and then having a major illness over half of your body. 

I was panicking all morning, but now I can finally relax that it is over (no more ""should I do it"" anxiety). Denied three calls from my mother, who probably thinks I'm pregnant since I wouldn't tell her why I was going to the doctor. It was a stressful morning. 

I believe in you! 💜",2019-01-02 20:28:34
abx582,"I’m interested to know how you can go ahead and get them done?
 It might only be at the birth, but when my son was born they offered vitamin K and I had a section so my husband had him in the other room at the end. They refused to give him the injection until mum (me) said it was okay! Even though they knew he was the dad. 
Seemed very odd to me! Just wondering have you been asked for mother’s consent? I don’t think that should be a thing by the way! Just curious. 
Also good on you for getting it done, I hope his immune system recovers well 💪",2019-01-02 23:20:04

Then you’re human garbage. The unjust taking of any life, especially by the state, is unacceptable. There is no threshold.

“Some genocides are more important than others.” Yep, you’re human garbage confirmed.

>I absolutely despise all cases of colonial genocide, but this post isn't about colonial genocide. 

You’re lying, and this thread that you specifically responded to absolutely is about colonial genocide. In addition, what the fuck do you think the mainlaind Han Chinese incursion on Uyghur land is? Ffs I swear geography curriculum is failing people. Do you know anything about the situation other than “China commies bad 😤”? 

>You read like a China sympathizer considering your general attitude and name, so your opinions don't count for much. 

I’m a fucking Anarchist you smoothbrained dimwit, I sit in opposition to all forms of authoritarianism including the CCP’s faux-Left state. You are not bright.

>Anyone even considering defending such an abhorrent state isn't worth talking with. 

Yet here you are talking to those who do it, but it damn sure ain’t me Billy Bob.

>The same goes for people who defend any other state that has committed atrocities (such as Canada) in recent memory and hasn't taken proper action to undo their wrongs. 

Yet here you are doing it, Jim Crow. 

>By attempting to destract from a current and abhorrent genocide, you are defending China.

I just help out where I can. I know times are rough and we all need a little boost now and then. In times of hardship, you will always remember those who helped you make it through, and I encourage everyone who sees this to be that person who someone remembers.

You may not have much to give, but remember not every gift has to be monetary. You can spend your time with those who may feel lonely, or lend your voice to those who need someone to speak on their behalf.

Much love to you u/emanu21 and I wish you and your family the best 🖤.

a9fi2j,"I agree with you 100% on that but how would we even start to do that? Nobody besides Bernie (who got screwed by the DNC) talks about fixing that.

It’s a complicated issue and not one I can trust the current government to bring about with more tax dollars. 

For this and other reasons, I voted Republican. ☹️",2018-12-25 18:51:19

dgib1y,"So for all those wondering why we should care about HK and Western companies on bended knees overlooking our laws, your civil and consumer rights and the constitution ..then check out what the **Chinese govement** has been up to lately and why they might not be not the most compatible partner for the West.

There is concern that mobile execution units have made organ harvesting much easier and more profitable, as lethal injection does not damage the body.*""


Please remember this isn't xenophobia or racism or a direct issue with the Chinese people.... but an issue with their autocratic leader and his government which they are brainwashed to ignore and accept.  We take equal issue with the Western companies who support this and their attacks on their own customers I.e. ***us.***

After decades of opening up Western market to China while turning a blind eye to rampant Chinese IP thefts, forced tech transfers, & protectionism, we are looking at widespread control of Western firms by China. Firms that are not under outright Chinese control still kowtow to China out of fear of China's retaliation.

This is a very incomplete list of what we're seeing publicly. Imagine how bad it is behind closed doors.

**Western companies with Backbones**

* Matt Stone & Trey Parker: South Park ""Band in China""

* Red Bull: released video supporting protests for freedom & liberty (fan edit).

* Ubisoft: listened to fans, said no to China after initially saying they would tone down game content to be China-compliant.

* Prague: cancel partnership with Beijing over 1-China principle

* Immutable: offer to repay banned gamer's winnings that was confiscated by Blizzard, got cyber attacked as a result""

**Update:**

* The Red bull ad is old and a fan edit. They have not supported HK at this time but have ties to China.

* Disney supported the cast of Mulan in their anti HK rhetoric.

***Please add your own examples***...if you've fact checked it and fact check these too.  Facts still matter!  

Please Google China's involvement in ethnic cleansing, execution vans, concentration camps, child prostitution, organ harvesting, western IP theft, citizen brain washing and much more. 

We reiterate that this is an issue with the Chinese government and not the wonderful people and history of China and it's contribution to the world.  This isn't xenophobia.  This is about it's autocrat dictator god emperor for life Ji Xingping and his evil corrupt rule which as with Russia has spread to the West.

ihaqsl,"I believe it's actually just much easier to see them because of the dramatic contrast and shadows near the middle. The further up or down you go the angles change and make it harder to see. Also keep in mind the moon is not flat 😂🎑

It's a 3d ball so asteroids or rocks coming in can hit it on any surface depending on where they're coming from. Now whether their trajectories are more likely to be from a certain direction or not, and whether the rotation of the moon around the earth and around its axis will expose those sides more or not is something beyond me. Also the fact that we mostly only see one face of the moon from our earthly perspective, so we have a limited view so to speak.

I'm also highly unknowledgeable in this particular field of science, having studied Biochemistry, Immunology and physiology instead of planetary bodies so I'm definitely not 100% in the 'knows what he's talking about' camp.",2020-08-27 03:03:04

Sometimes we would just fart on each other’s desks or do wall farts while we were talking in the hallway. Awe I miss that guy 😊 I think I got off topic here.. FTR I’m a mom and yes very gross I know.

If you're stuck inside, from quarantine or a storm, and you order food, remember: TIP YOUR DELIVERY DRIVERS!!!

Even during all the recent nonsense and inconvenient truths, there are still those amazingly dense people that think that the ones who go the extra mile so they don't have to don't deserve *gratitude* in the form of *gratuity* for their efforts. Screw those people.

For the majority of those showing appreciation: we delivery people thank you for it. It's nice being the one to get to bring a little joy and sustainance to you during hard times... but even nicer when the people show you they appreciate you. ❤️


ps - please also shovel your walkways.

The guy had lost his 3 middle fingers and only had the pinky and thumb left. When he would wave you would just see that. Kids would wave back in the “Shaka” way (probably waving in an insulting way lore seems to say) but the hand wave took of on the islands and people just started to wave at each other with the 🤙 Shaka.",2021-05-19 22:38:46

Second time it happened at that mother fuckers house too. After the first time I was like alright, please make sure to give me a blanket next time. He agrees, we stay up partying again the next time, I forget to remind him and he forgets as well. Same thing as last time lol.

dgua6k,"You know what's better than this image?

Video documentaries of the ten thousand Chinese citizens being killed by their government over the four days of bloodshed that occurred all over Beijing before this picture was taken. History forgets how graphic and cruel this event was. And this picture often being the only visual representation of the 1989 Tienanman Square Massacre used in textbooks and the news is a big part of its erasure.

Look up a video documentary, and make sure you see the graphic details to get a real sense. Seriously. History is important and ought to be experienced viscerally. This picture, as famous as it is, does not do enough.

I am not going to link a video bc every time I do it gets taken down, bc YouTube/Google is beholden to China just like every other capitalistic institution 🤦‍♂️",2019-10-12 17:38:04
dgua6k,"***What brave souldiers*** rhey must have been.  To drive their tanks all that way to run over some little kids with boards and banners.

They probably knew some of them or they were related or maybe dating. Such brave loyal men... only following orders.  All promoted, all rewarded for their loyalty to the Chinese state.  Such patriots. Such pride.

**But** on that day the Chinese military and government and all those who came after who choose to aid in the cover up....***betrayed*** China and betrayed themselves.

All Cowards.  An then a generations of cowards raised on convenient lies.  But a nation of cowards can only hide for so long in the dark.  The West for all its flaws is the light of truth. And Hong Kong has been touched by enlightenment... that there is another way other than lies.  And they fight as you read this , for the freedom to live a life of ***truth and democracy.***

Because if China looses this fragile light...it will sink back under the cover of darkness and wrap itself in the comfort of lies.  Every Western company they now influence and control will pull us all down with them.  We already see this in our own governments and mega evil corps.  

Choose to reject cowards , fake news and lies and support facts and the truly brave men ,women and children of HK.  So when the tanks again roll in..and they will in some form...they will know we have their back.

Tell your friends and family. Your schools. Your politicians. Your representation. Make a donation. Make a choice. Make the right one.  

***And Remember*** democracy is fragile and every one around our world makes the other stronger.  Every death of democracy weakens us all.

A friend visited China earlier this year and when she went to visit the Square she was warned: (1) it's one of the most heavily surveiled areas in China (which is very heavily surveiled); (2) Its super illegal to talk about the massacre, so don't mention why you're there; (3) Younger Chinese have no idea that there ever was a massacre, and they've instead been taught it's some other kind of tourist attraction 😞",2019-10-12 15:56:35

orzo9q,"Yehey! Congrats! 

Goosebumps.

I was in high school when we almost won our first Olympic gold, amateur boxing.

1996 Atlanta.

Everybody woke up at around 3 in the morning to watch the final match live.

The fight was close, but our man came up short on the scorecards.

Disappointing.

This Gold medal feels so sweet.

And this lady was doing exceptionally well in international competitions the last few years, it was inevitable that she'll have a chance to officially get us a gold medal.

The back of my mind was not really hoping that much, though. We always seem to come up short.

Welcome surprise today 🥇🇵🇭",2021-07-26 19:04:12

orzo9q,"Hey man, just some friendly advice. Take it or leave it. I think u were genuinely interested in what being tagged really meant, apart from the obvious connotation. When u talk to people on the internet, it’s common to get yelled at for asking a question that you could’ve googled. I’m sure you already knew u could’ve googled it, but some people take pride in being a “leader” and calling people out. However, this is a forum meant for p2p comms so idk why everyone is so sensitive and bitchy sometimes when people talk to each other and ask questions instead of googling everything. We aren’t at work. You were asking an honest question. However, you allowed yourself to get caught up in an internet argument which is where u went wrong. You could’ve been arguing with a 9 year-old for all you know. 

Anyways, cheers and good vibes to all ☮️",2021-07-26 19:29:46

My 5 year-old is non-verbal autistic, and late summer he had a really bad seizure out of nowhere and needed to be airlifted to ICU. He was unconscious and intubated for nearly 24 hours. By far the scariest day of my life. As a parent, there’s nothing scarier than the possibility of losing your child, but also there’s no better feeling than when they get better and back to themselves. So so happy for you.",2020-11-22 01:51:33

116uvs4,Question why not just ask your mom why post it? Anyways that’s a awesome find! So here’s my guesss…..Could of just been a book that was purchased and someone in your family held onto it. It’s good to learn about special needs children. As a former daycare worker when you have a young child come into a classroom setting it’s good to be informed by parents just in case of any emergencies of any kind of health issues. For example like some young children have seizures or need medication during the day and must attend the nursing station. Or autism or many other forms of special needs. Read the book tell us what you learn? Do a book report for fun 🤷🏻‍♀️Good book to study and look at how much technology and studies have advanced from back in the day.,2023-02-20 07:23:07

The girls, who she was so relentlessly mean to and critical of. The girls, who she told every day how difficult it was to raise girls compared to boys. How she preferred raising boys. 🙄

116uvs4,"On the flip side, my cousin used to boast about his genius middle daughter (didn’t say the same about his two older daughters from a previous marriage…). She was just an average young child. Most children are able to memorize things and repeat them back when asked. However, the fact she could do this was AMAZING to my cousin and the rest of the family. To the point they had her on the local radio channel reciting the starting line up for a MLB team because my cousin got her to memorize it. My dad had me memorize all the different species of water foul found in the Midwest when I was 3-4 y/o but he didn’t put me on the radio 🤷🏼‍♀️

All this attention she received trained her to become attention seeking. She would act out in group events (pre-k programs, school events, etc.) and basically take any attention away from the well behaved kids. My cousin still thought she was a genius and gave her more praise for being “talented” when she was clearly not following directions.

When she started elementary school, her teacher approached my cousin about getting her tested at the university hospital’s child life specialty clinic. He was bragging about her being tested to confirm she was a genius. After a while, my cousin didn’t bring up her intelligence as much. Turns out, the test wasn’t to see if she was a genius, it was to test her for behavior disorders and learning disabilities. I don’t know if she was ever diagnosed with anything but she isn’t a genius, just average.

TL;DR: my cousin was the opposite of your mother. He thought his kid was a genius, got her tested and found out she is of average intelligence.",2023-02-20 05:35:01

As soon as I jumped, this sweet happy-go-lucky puppy had almost doubled in size (hair all poofed out) and was flying through the air at this guys face snarling like some hellbeast.  Fortunately, I was quick enough that I caught her mid-jump and the contractor was quick enough he was 1/2 way across the yard.

Seriously. I worked in beer for like 5 years, and my entry into the industry wasn't at a low-point in my consumption 

I would wake up and puke. Every day. For years. Even if I ""took a break"" and didn't drink for like a week, I'd still be fighting nausea in the mornings. 

2019 has been the least drinky year of my adult life (although the last 3 weeks have been a shit spiral of depression and alcohol). I've lost 25 lbs, don't feel nauseous/vomit all the time, and sort of feel like I'm moving towards better things in life rather than feeling like I'm circling the drain.",2019-08-13 19:23:35

Not as nauseous as Donald Trump makes me, but my son once met Trump and said he was nice. He just makes my stomach turn as if I have a burning and gassy sensation in my chest. Can we open the window I feel a bit warm after having that soup, I know you said wait to eat but I thought it might help my headache after the kids were running around her.

I woke up one morning and my body just wouldn't do anything... it was like paralysis but I knew I wasn't paralysed. Wasn't hungry. Couldn't move except to reach for the remote... luckily for me it seemed to pass pretty quickly.

gvsbx3,"I’m from a small town in central Florida. I was definitely told multiple times growing up “It’s fine to be friends with a black boy but don’t date one.” I was born in the 80’s and my Moms older friends would also tell me “You don’t want no high yeller children- their lives are hard.” 🤦‍♀️There were plenty of mixed couples when I was in high school, most of the people my own age were fine with it. There were a few though you’d here say on she’s a “n*** lover” or some other derogatory phrase. The older population was definitely NOT cool with it. My husband is military and we were in Okinawa almost 4 years, I also heard some stories from black friends married to Japanese women that there is racism in that community as well. One in particular had been on a 2nd tour in Oki and his children were older- they were bilingual and heard some older Japanese complaining “why do they have to mix with blacks?” The kids went up and confronted them! Told them something like your true colors are showing you’ve got to be careful in Okinawa you never know who knows Japanese!",2020-06-03 14:03:46

Was at fort Polk in the neighboring parish for some training and we cane to Alexandria for some fun and food. It seemed really inhospitable to me at least all my black soldiers were getting side eyes and stared at and I was blown away by pictures of slaves picking cotton fields just chillin on the walls in restaurants.

The sign is fine and all, personally I think this should revolve around re-educating police and not on race, but wearing any piece of a uniform to garner support isn’t looked highly on. If I went to a protest in mine and was identified, I would receive reduction in rank or a discharge, some kind of punishment. The military is supposed to be non partisan, a force for all Americans regardless of race or creed. You’re allowed to be a member and have an opinion, but you aren’t allowed to go around wearing the uniform and indirectly/directly associating that branch or group with a cause no matter how noble like this.

Edit: listen my dudes I was just trying to extend kindness to someone carrying a level of guilt that I could not fathom. Yeah the Nazis used that excuse, but guess what the Nazis weren’t sorry. At all. 

Yeah technically you’re “allowed” to disobey an illegal order, but the reality of taking that action in a war zone is a lot more difficult than any of us will ever know or understand. I think that the only people who can really understand the pressure of those situations are people who lived in war.

alcf59,"I’ve seen this happen before! It’s so enraging. What do they think foreign means?!

Someone was telling a story, I think it was on Twitter, about an American older woman who wanted to pay in Canada with American dollars. The clerk was like “we don’t take foreign money” and the woman was like “WHAT DO YOU MEAN FOREIGN?!” 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

Also the balls to try to make someone in another country speak *your* language. As if they took the trouble to learn other languages when they travel abroad, but yet they expect every foreign tourist to speak English when they visit America. 

Wtf, people. Get real. I saw a TSA officer ask a couple of tourists if they spoke English and then shook their heads at them when they said no. If that TSA woman ever left her country and visited France, would she like it if the people at the airport asked her why she doesn’t speak French? But I bet she would expect every French person to speak to her in English. That makes no sense. 

Please don’t be like this, people. It makes no sense to have such a limited view of the world. The world doesn’t revolve around what you think you know. It’s one of the most embarrassing things about Americans, I swear. Everyone must speak English but don’t expect me to learn a few words in other languages. If your name sounds difficult I won’t even try and I’ll call you what I want. ",2019-01-30 18:12:35

alcf59,"I came to France at the age of 28 and didn’t speak a word of French so learnt it from scratch. I’m now completely fluent (albeit with an accent that apparently people find quite charming so that’s a plus!) but it took a lot of work to get there (and French girlfriend help 😊)

In all the time I’ve been here, the only people who have ever criticized my French are French people who don’t speak a word of English. Every French person whose English is anywhere from ""able to hold a simple conversation"" to ""completely bilingual"" heap praise on my French speaking level. I put a HUGE amount of work in to learn French and it’s really nice to be complimented on it. At all times, even after being here for only a couple of months, non-English speaking French people would straight out belittle my French level and couldn’t understand why I wasn’t fluent, whilst at the same time French people who’d made the effort to learn a certain level of English couldn’t heap enough praise and repeat how impressed they were with my French.

So I think English speaking tourists who’ve never tried to learn another language just don’t get it. I’m not Dutch but I know that they’re English is amazing and I bet not one Dutch tourist (noting probably 99% of the Dutch population under 50 now speaks fluent English) has ever criticised a non-English native speaker for their ""poor"" English.",2019-01-30 15:56:59

alcf59,"This was a number of years ago and was literally deep deep country Belgium the name of which unfortunately I do not know. Our plan was to visit Flanders fields as my father is a history nut. However, the person who instructed my sister on where to go got it completely wrong and we went to the wrong end if that makes sense? I think it might have been the last train stop! It actually turned out to be an amazing trip!! The cemetery we visited was small but the American retired soldier who looked after it was only delighted to show us around. It was he that told is they don't normally get visitors unless it was a direct relative. Afterwards we ventured into the town. The people were so so friendly. There was a market in the square and when we asked about somewhere to eat (in French!) the man actually closed his stall and brought us to a pub/ restaurant. When we walked in everyone stopped and looked. They all had the most welcoming faces and started talking to us all at once. They stood up and made room for us to sit. 
 Unfortunately my French is very limited and my parents have none so it was up to my sister to translate everything for us. They sat us down and ordered food and beer for us. I was in my element, as were my parents. My word Belgian beer and Belgian fries are amazing!! I also had some sort of meatballs of memory serves. This was without doubt one of my favourite holidays. We got to see locals in their own setting off the beaten track. I've been to lots of places but I hate the touristy thing. I prefer to actually visit the country I'm in in a natural setting iykwim.


So, do you speak Flemish also? How many languages have you, if you don't mind me asking? 
My sister was obviously under the mistaken idea that Belgians and people from Luxembourg had approx 5 languages but English wasn't one of them. It had always fascinated me how people can be so good at learning languages and I am so useless. 😭

Shall Issue permits have only ever resulted in people being left defenseless against those from whom they’re seeking protection. Those who seek to carry for ill intent don’t give a fuck what permits are available. No thanks. As for the amount of lead one can pump, again, you are talking about literally ANY semi-auto weapon. 

You just justify why ANY round amount needs additional scrutiny over another round amount. You have yet to do so, nor has anyone else. 

Insurance? You mean the thing that only pays out for accidents, but not negligence or intentional illegal acts? Looks like that’s going to be a big waste of time, then, because neither criminal acts like muggings or mass shootings nor negligence like shooting someone while you’re finger fucking a loaded gun at a party will be covered. The criminals who already possess their guns illegally certainly won’t be getting that policy, and a policy that I carry sure as shit won’t be responsible for someone else’s actions.

dhp5x5,"Mate you’re really calling out the false equivalencies for a person who started this with a baseless opinion. We aren’t obligated to change your mind until YOU back up YOUR primary position that started this. 

You made a claim. You are obligated to back that claim before anyone is obligated to provide you evidence in order to change your mind. Obviously we’re talking about an issue that you can’t prove any more than someone can prove you wrong. “2a would keep this from happening in the US” is your baseless opinion that’s impossible to back up with fact. If the original claim is baseless and impossible to prove, how on earth can someone use proof to disprove it?

But of course you knew that when you wrote your first comment, and were excited to watch someone try so you could pull out the false equivalency line, paired with the “you’re wrong, try again”🙄

Take it from someone who agrees with you- I believe 2a makes it far morw difficult for this to go down in the US the way it is in HK- you don’t get to belittle someone’s baseless argument when yours started that way. These are all opinions and nothing more.

Let’s try this, for example, if you don’t get what I mean.

“I have shoes, therefore if I needed to run a mile, I would run it quicker than someone without shoes”.

Probably, it makes sense. But how tf would I ever prove that? How could I prove that every time I run the mile I’m quicker than whoever the barefoot runner is? As you mentioned, it’s a false equivalency. The fact that I have shoes and that shoes will largely help someone run faster does not mean that if I beat someone running barefoot it was because of the shoes.

You can’t prove me wrong, and I can’t prove myself right. Just the same as “2a makes this impossible in the US.” Yeah? Prove it.",2019-10-14 17:26:44

hr98n9,"Bruh, have you gone through the system? They stack the fuck outta your charges. Pulled over for broken tail light? You end up with 8 charges on some bullshit. 

They know that we know the history of the judicial system and a “jury of your peers” is typically 10 white, suburban jurors aged 40-65 years old, which never ever bodes well for us, as they can’t relate. 

I don’t have time to go into detail, but I had to take a plea and had to beg (literally beg) to do a deferred prosecution program and pay $350 a month, EVERY MONTH, for 17 months. I was 15. I couldn’t work and we were poor as fuck. Our mortgage was $500 a month, which i only know after my mom passed in ‘03, yes, I was still a kid. I’ll make time and explain below: 

I’ll spare the details but my parents had to get second jobs and I, predictably, had to keep selling dope. You see the trap? If I get caught with dope, guess what? Probation violation. Prison. If I can’t pay $350 a month at 15 years old, guess what? Probation violation. Prison. What do you do? 

As a result of overwork, being underpaid and living less than check to check, because of me, my mom had a complete mental break down at work, attempted suicide and had to be committed for a few weeks. She was never the same after that. 

Want to know what I did? 😬 “Trespassing”. 

As a part of late 90s integration, they bussed black kids from the hood, to suburban schools. I had to catch my bus at 5:40am to be there at 7 for school lol. 

Anyway, I missed my activity bus after school (I ran track), so realizing how far i am, and uncomfortable in the suburbs, I decided to cut through a middle school that had long been dismissed, as it was around 6:30pm. A cop was sitting in the parking lot, as they do, saw me running, mind you, all I’m trying to do is catch the city bus or I’m fucked. I’m still 15; I’m a kid. All I have is my book bag, my jacket over my shoulder and my clean Fresh Prince hair cut lol. (Mind you, parents are walking the track with baby strollers and toy dogs in tow.)

Anyway, I’m arrested and taken down town and have to call my parents and explain i didn’t do anything (Tell me if you’ve heard that one before) as they’re worried why i wasn’t home from school at 9:30pm on a school night. I was terrified. 

By time I saw the magistrate, I had the Trespassing (2 diff charges), criminal menacing, evading arrest (because i was running to a bus stop lol), resisting (idk) and failure to show id. Mind you, I’m fucking 15, who has ID? This was the late 90s. So no social media, no cell phones, no Uber, none of that shit. 

But this isn’t about me and I’m sorry to hijack this thread, but I just wanted to show you how some people, like me, had to plea. You have no other option. 

We were poor. Like, we used to stand at the food bank on Saturdays for cheese and peanut butter, poor. We had no money for legal fees, nor to fight ANY case. I take the plea, I get trespassing and they drop the other charges. What do you do? See, talk is cheap until you have no options. My back was against the wall from jump. Plan B for me is go against an officer in court. I’m a broke black kid, bussed into a suburban neighborhood. They not hearing that shit, I’m a menace simply by existing in that space. 

“Don’t plea, fight!” It’s not that simple, fam. I’m tried as an adult at 15 with no money? C’mon, son. I’m doing 5 years from jump and my life is ruined as I’m deemed “unhireable” after all i did was run to catch a bus for the hour long ride home. That’s what chaps my ass about the “police don’t pull you over for no reason” folks. I have a physics and astronomy degree, work on campus and have traveled the world. 

Now, do you see how fighting could have taken all of that? With a record, I’m the dude still selling drugs, being judged and the reason some lady clutches her purse and pearls as I walk by. That’s never who I was, but my future could have been altered simply based off of perception. Mind you, I’m a nobody! Lol. I’m just lucky enough to have Reddit as my medium to vent to. How many stories like mine go the other way? Imagine how many people decided to “fight the system” and lost. People, far smarter and infinitely more talented than me; gone. We have to fold in the name of self preservation. It not that simple, not everybody has the means to fight. 

Again, I came out ok, but many of us don’t. I had to do A LOT of explaining to my school, The University of South Carolina, even though i was on an athletic scholarship. Lots of letters, lots of character witnesses, all of it. Because, you know, “thug athletes”, shut up and dribble culture and all that. 

The game is rigged, but fight if you must. Just recognize that the house always wins. 

If you’ve made it this far, I sincerely thank you for reading and know that I love you for it. Talking about some of those shit is always cathartic. 


Edit: Sorry for hijacking, this isn’t about me in no way. I just wanted to illustrate how easily is for a black male to become trapped and put through the ringer in the name of justice.

hr98n9,"Thank you, friend. Your words are appreciated.  My story isn’t unique, i promise you. I wish people would step outside their comfort zone and just talk/listen to somebody that wouldn’t normally speak to. 

That young dude in the store buying smokes that your parents told you is “bad”, dap him up, talk to him and just listen as he smokes. Many of us have a weird PTSD type of trauma and takes fight or flight up a whoooole different notch. If there is one thing I’d do in the world is set up people different backgrounds to just listen and to gain perspective, which is why i appreciate the Reddit boards so much! 

Sadly, that wasn’t the first time i was taken downtown and finger printed for “no id”. The first time happened during the summer prior to this particular arrest lol. Again, we were all 14 and 15, they took all of us downtown, finger printed us and made us catch the city bus back home. 

I have lots of stories about me growing up in Charlotte in my history, once you get past all the Tales and Dark Souls posts lol. I could talk for days, as I’ve had a lot of bad experiences that made me appreciate my journey and come up. We could literally talk for hours. Again, I’m just a normal black dude. Def nobody special, nor noteworthy. 

As far as the grudge, I still haven’t, i won’t lie. It’s hard but I try to maintain and avoid them if I can. When I see people run, trust me, I understand the thought process and reaction. 

I won’t take up your time, but I’ll leave you with this: That event took place in 10th grade at my new high school. The fist time me and my friends were stopped/detained by an officer, I was 11 years old. It’s why the Tamir Rice case hurts me so. That can easily have been one of us. Anyway, I have a July birthday so even though I say 11, i was a few weeks away from turning 12 years old. But, we were walking to buy some Marvel Masterpiece cards and to play some Killer Instinct at the arcade. Yup, detained for about 45 mins for being “suspicious”. 

All we had on us were quarters. It’s the summer, and being kids, think dirty ass T-shirt’s, nut  cutting shirts, big fucking teeth and big feet, as most prepubescent kids have lol. Two of us are walking, one on his Mongoose dirt bike with another friend on the rear pegs. I remember almost EVERYTHING about this day (down to the dove cooing as I’m on this cars hot ass hood)

But anyway, we hear a loud ass engine roaring and  coming up from behind us. This mf cut us off, flips his lights and gets out with his hand on his service pistol yelling. I was on confused he sounded like Charlie Browns teacher, i didn’t hear a single word. I remember being confused and thinking should i run? Wondering if i was about to die, etc. Long story short, he tried cuffing myself and my friend, but I was a 90lb bean pole and the cuffs wouldn’t fit lol. He ended up letting us go about about a half hour to 45 mins later, with zero explanation. The whole rest of that day was weird. We hardly talked, we didn’t laugh, we stopped joking and I remember feeling like we cheated death. We played Killer Instinct in absolute silence. Looking back, i think we were trying to see who would cry first and if doing so was “ok”. I felt sick and nauseous for days after that. 

By 13, I’d learned to just run away and hide, as I’d been stopped/detained no less than 5 times by the end of that summer. It’s always the same cops, even the cool black ones knew, but just told us to “comply” if they pulled up on us. They put cops who are from my community and only know about me, from what they learned growing up and from what they hear in the newspaper about “evil rap music and ghettos”. Until you’ve seen a grown man with a a weapon, an alibi and authority shake and be nervous as fuck, you don’t know fear. Lawd, let me get off of my soap box lol. 

Thanks again for listening, my friend. Seriously, I appreciate you and anybody else reading. I have other posts that I’ll link to here tomorrow, chocked full of receipts and funny stories. I’m no angel, but did what i had to do to get out, which i did. Thanks again for your time and your ear! 

Pardon any typos, I’m sleepy. But I feel better now. 🙏🏽",2020-07-15 05:21:51

It's so sad!! I understand that a woman's reproductive rights and the ability to have abortions has essentially been deemed non-existent, but no one should force their man to get a vasectomy as punishment for our rights being taken away, or use it as an easy out.

Whatever happened to people just being adults and practicing safe sex? Sure, protection doesn't work 💯, but it's better than taking the chance of getting a vasectomy and it doesn't work (then you're out the $ AND you'll have a kid) or it messes up the guys' health....

I'd rather risk it with protection and keep our sexual health - they say everything happens for a reason, so if you're using protection and it doesn't work, maybe that child was meant to be and it's time to grow up and be responsible 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

Not everyone can be/wants to be a parent and I understand that, but we're also taught at a young age that ""You can't always get what you want"". Forcing someone to get a vasectomy b/c you don't want to get pregnant but also don't want to use protection, is selfish and sad. 

Getting an abortion or having a vasectomy should not be the answer to not wanting kids - unless you're getting it for actual health reasons, choosing an abortion or vasectomy is just a selfish, easy way out.

*The only exception I feel that justifies the need of an abortion is rape/incest/or health of the mother is jeopardized - otherwise I don't think abortions are the wisest choice either*",2022-09-28 18:11:19

xqc7os,"That's what birth control is for 🤦🏼‍♀️ there are many different birth control options out there - while there may be hormonal changes  that's why you can try a few different ones to see which has the least amount of side effects. I even heard they're coming out with a bc pill for men! So either one of you can take it... Or both as an extra precaution. Doesn't mean you need to permanently kill your man-hood. You might still get hard, still ejaculate, but there's nothing exciting about sperm that doesn't work, it's just a sticky pointless mess. It may as well just be a milky booger or something, cuz it's not a creampie anymore 😅 no guy likes condoms, no guy likes to pull out, and not every guy is ready for/wants a kid... and while I understand that,  you should understand that you don't need a vasectomy to get around those things - just sounds like lame excuses. But whatever floats your boat ⛵🤷🏼‍♀️",2022-09-28 21:24:23

xqc7os,"You don't have to ask a woman to do that... If she doesn't want kids she'll be a responsible adult and do it on her own, willingly and without having to be asked!! There are women out there who aren't even having sex, yet take birth control to even out their time of month... They know what works for their bodies and don't need to be asked to do it. If she can't take bc for health reasons and you don't like condoms, I'm sorry but too bad! It's better than making a baby you're not ready for or not having sex at all ... Small price to pay vs a vasectomy which is a huge price to pay - esp if it doesn't ""take"" or you get PVPS or some other side effect.

We're all adults and by now should know how babies are made. If we want sex with no baby making, there are ways to go about that without doing something permanent. They claim it's reversible but it'll never be the same. Just keep that in mind 👍🏼",2022-09-28 21:44:22

xqc7os,"Kids are expensive, but that's not a good enough reason to get a vasectomy... If the vasectomy doesn't ""take"" and you still have a kid, that logic makes no sense. You do realize vasectomies don't always work and are not something to ""fix"" the risk of having a kid? There are things you can do to prevent pregnancy other than having a vasectomy... I think people need to do more research before they jump on the vasectomy bandwagon. It's not a cure-all to prevent pregnancy!!!! Even the vasectomy procedure itself is an optional surgery, which means you don't NEED to do it for health reasons, and there are risks for every kind of surgery!! On top of that, some guys get PVPS (I just learned about this) which is a painful side effect of vasectomies that doesn't show up/happen right away - you might feel it a few months later tho.... but good luck to y'all!!! Hopefully the money not spent on a kid you didn't want is worth it, and maybe the world is better off without your spermies becoming kids who'll dumb down the population - they say kids follow in their parents footsteps 🤷🏼‍♀️ lolol",2022-09-28 22:10:18

122ruhv,"Got into an internet argument with someone on a local news message board a few weeks ago (stupid, i know). Our local area (which oddly has a large irish ex-pat community) was having an lgbtq inclusive st patricks day parade, basically in defiance of the many parades that have decline requests of lgtbq groups to be allowed to march in parades. Theyve done this parade for several years running now, trying to emphasize that the holiday and celebration of irish culture is for everyone, and its been a big success.

This person was basically pulling the “queer groups are groomers who are trying to expose children to sexuality” argument and that “st patricks day should be run by the catholic church as it always has and to keep our kids safe”. 

Think about that. Arguing to KEEP KIDS SAFE FROM GROOMING. By trusting THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.

I of course immediately pointed out that the church has been responsible for systematically covering up the sexual abuse of children by many of its clergy for literal centuries, and funny enough, the person i was arguing with stopped responding🤔",2023-03-26 17:53:03

j2db23,"Of course this post is (mostly) a joke, but we Canadians need to always consider the inescapable effect that American domestic politics has on Canadian society. We don’t really live across the street so much as share a duplex - and what happens if one family in a duplex burns their house down? The reality is that some of the positions espoused in that debate that we, or at least many Canadians, find offensive are increasingly held by Canadians. You need only go through the comment section of even CBC articles on American political events to see some of the frightening polarization happening in political rhetoric on the north side of the border. More worrisome than people’s politics is the unwillingness to even debate with any modicum of decorum. Everything devolves into a flame war. What is sad when watching the debate is not really what is said, but the knowledge that politics is so hostile there that 95% of people probably vote by party alone, could vote before a candidate were even chosen. They don’t need to hear anything because the other party is already the enemy, on par with a foreign military one, not even at the level of fellow citizens. I’d love in Canada to have three more major parties if they were all forced to work together to pass bills, rather than devolving into simplistic “dirty commies” vs “dirty fascists” mudslinging all the time.

After decades of opening up Western market to China while turning a blind eye to rampant Chinese IP thefts, forced tech transfers, & protectionism, we are looking at widespread control of Western firms by China. Firms that are not under outright Chinese control still kowtow to China out of fear of China's retaliation.

This is a very incomplete list of what we're seeing publicly. Imagine how bad it is behind closed doors.

**Western companies with Backbones**

* Matt Stone & Trey Parker: South Park ""Band in China""

* Red Bull: released video supporting protests for freedom & liberty (fan edit).

* Prague: cancel partnership with Beijing over 1-China principle

* Immutable: offer to repay banned gamer's winnings that was confiscated by Blizzard, got cyber attacked as a result""

**Update:**

* The Red bull ad is old and a fan edit. They have not supported HK at this time but have ties to China.

* Disney supported the cast of Mulan in their anti HK rhetoric.

***Please add your own examples***...if you've fact checked it and fact check these too.  Facts still matter!  

Please Google China's involvement in ethnic cleansing, execution vans, concentration camps, child prostitution, organ harvesting, western IP theft, citizen brain washing and much more. 

We reiterate that this is an issue with the Chinese government and not the wonderful people and history of China and it's contribution to the world.  This isn't xenophobia.  This is about it's autocrat dictator god emperor for life Ji Xingping and his evil corrupt rule which as with Russia has spread to the West.

dfyw13,"This should be voted much much MUCH higher. Especially for right now. 

I know in the grand scheme of things relative to Reddit, this post isn’t THAT cool. But right now..... with Hong Kong and China on the verge of something insane... like war.... idk. 

An image like this just continues to educate those who may not know the true evil of China, or even why some people don’t like China... it’s cause of things like this... China has done things like this to it’s own people for centuries, but they are somehow so good at covering it up or have been incredibly lucky that the world’s attention has been focused elsewhere.

Now we’re tapping into the strength of business relationships in the context of global economic democracy and American capitalism and our democratic republic... what is the limit American brands are willing to go to keep their relationships with mainland China in the face of these protests? Which side will they choose?

onggtd,good luck to them! as a former dog groomer im glad to see things like this happening! having different breeds is fine but in my opinion when it can make the dog I'll from breathing problems or joint problems I think we've taken it too far😓😓,2021-07-19 15:43:00

onggtd,"There’s many dog breeds that need this treatment. All the inbreeding/selective breeding has gone *waaaay* too far. This is now common knowledge here on Reddit, but many of the unique looking dog breeds that were strong and healthy companions a hundred years ago have become sickly, grotesquely deformed victims. 

It’s crazy to me how many people who think of themselves as “animal lovers” get dogs like this or the pug and don’t think about it any more than “awwwwe so cute haha 😍”. If they were humans, these deformed dog breeds would be disabled/special needs. *That’s* what we’ve turned them into. Not that there’s anything wrong with people who are disabled or have special needs, but you wouldn’t selectively breed them to have those problems for the sake of their appearance, would you? You wouldn’t bring a life in this world with a guarantee of health problems and suffering?

If you truly love animals, then never buy deformed breeds. Instead support efforts like the one mentioned above, and if you know someone who fetishizes such breeds, please respectfully educate them on the problems associated with them. Show them pictures of what they looked like before they became what they are now.",2021-07-19 22:39:15
onggtd,"A lot of health issues come from breeding for aesthetics. It happens with hunting dogs to the point you have “show bred” and “field bred” dogs. 🤔 I remember reading how they bred out the Irish setter.

You’re already getting murdered. What had started out as a pretty good day: having consensual sex and all, took a turn for the worst, not only being killed but getting hacked and slashed off your mortal coil while naked. Great, dead and naked, all messed up looking, sure, flaccid penis shriveled by fear, the smallest it’s ever been(for the guy ), all on display. Along with all the very noticeable, deep odd stretch marks, and any acne as well.

My point, if I can find it. Don’t murder people. And every human body looks weird. It’s a part of being human, murdering people, not so much

hs7k7e,"I know this is over a day old, but I just wanted to say how jealous I am.

I used to live in Korea and I went to China at the same time my friend went back to Korea.  He got this treatment and immediately started sending me photos of his goodies while I got. . . 30 rolls of toilet paper. . .

Plus getting to stay in your apartment while you quarantine is such a nice plus.  You can be comfortable in your own environment, but I was stuck in a hotel room where they delivered meals.

TBH the quarantine will go both quicker and slower than you think at times.  The first few days are okay, but I hit a pretty big wall around day 7.  Just make sure you're staying active and try to get out of your own head whenever you can.  I ended up reading a lot and sleeping way too much, but don't be too hard on yourself if you're not as productive or engaged as you'd like to be.

Its hard to just be stuck in one place like that all the time.  Keep strong and best of luck! 😷✊ 화이팅!",2020-07-18 07:15:25

a96dzy,"My dad (only 60 years old at the time) walked himself into the ER on Christmas Eve last year and ended up in the ICU with two fully collapsed lower lobes of his lungs thanks to a horrible acute case of pneumonia. My boyfriend and I drove three hours when we heard and got there around midnight to find him on a respirator and in a medically induced coma. It went from “dad’s cough sure is sticking around a while” to “oh, well, my dad’s going to die on Christmas” in a matter of hours, but what I’ll never forget how kind everyone working in the ICU was. They worked so hard through Christmas Eve and all through the week, and were so gracious to the whole family. They pushed all sorts of furniture together so we could sleep there, brought coffee, breakfast, everything for us. Not to mention that they saved my dad’s life, who went from fully septic, vitals tanked, collapsed lungs, etc. on Christmas last year to him bitching about the weather this year. Thanks so much for what you do, we always remember it 😊",2018-12-25 01:17:29

a96dzy,"Have spent several Christmases in the hospital. As a patient I’m sending huge e-hugs & love (if wanted😃) and to THANK YOU!! For all that you do as a nurse but specifically for this. 
My nurse one year had the pin-up style and she was all decked out like you for Xmas.
She literally lit 🔥 up the room every time she came in and it made a big difference in my mood despite being terminally ill. (Only treatment no cure)

I learned, after stomach cancer, Goodpastures Syndrome & End Stage Renal Disease (spent years in the hospital) that it is not doctors or specialists who *heal* you.

It is these beautiful angels we call nurses. They put in the hard work of caring and healing you. And they really do care for you. I’m still in contact with some of them to this day because the bond we built was so strong.

I found so much respect & gratitude for these unsung hero’s I owe my life to. I’ve even had nurses CATCH doctors *mistakes* and prevented me from coding. 

Merry Christmas OP and again thank you.💓💓😂

They def could have lasted a year or two more on their own but had someone interested in buying their house so they made the decision to just go now. They lived in the middle of nowhere and grew their own vegetables and always had a stocked freezer cuz the store was far away. They literally went from a very good place to ride this out to a large apArtment of elderly ppl. Only silver lining is their apartment is on the first floor so they don’t have to go through the building. Oh wait nvm the dining halls and one regular sized fridge/freezer is their main source of food.

7ga0n5,"(Forgive formatting, on mobile)
This picture hits way too close to home. My granny loved to knit and crochet. She made such beautiful clothing for me as a baby. 



But about 2012, the signs of alzheimers started showing. 
She still loved to knit/crochet, would often ask my aunt or mum to take her to a local place to buy more yarn. Even though she had a literally cupboard full (but her brain couldn't process that) 
Mum or my aunt would ""start her off"" on a knee piece each time they'd visit. By the next visit, she'd have dropped too many stitches or lost tension so she'd be unraveling it.. 



When it progressed, she'd wait out the front, sometimes at night.
Crying that she wanted to go home (she came to Australia from England in 1966), saying she wanted to see her mother (who passed decades ago) 
Not long after these incidents, she was hospitalised due to a really bad fall and she had a weak heart. 



Grandad could no longer take care for her and as much as it broke his heart, she was transferred to an aged care facility. He visited her every morning, 8 on the dot so he could be with her during breakfast. He'd stay a few hours then go home to take care of their dog. He brought Lizzy in at least once a week to see her. And the other residents and carers adored Lizzy. 



She was admitted late September 2013 and around mid February 2014, she started to slow down. As if her body (or brain) didn't want to fight anymore. I believe she was unwell for a few weeks and it worsened. The family was made aware. My aunt travelled from Queensland to Adelaide for 3 weeks. She was still verbal up until  a week and a bit before her passing. I visited her and I cherish the fact that she knew who I was. She called me by my pet name. 



She stopped speaking, refused medication/food, then eventually became unresponsive as if she was in a deep sleep. (Well no food means the body needs to conserve energy and slows down) 




When it was close to the end, my mum and aunts decided to all take  turns staying with her overnight, incase it happened and so family could be alerted. It was my mums and interstate aunts turn. They had a ""sleep over"" and it sounded like they had good quality time together. 



At about 3:30 that morning, I had an odd feeling and started thinking about granny and if anything had happened. I hadn't slept at all bc I was worried. She passed away exactly an hour later. Mum called me half an hour after and I went straight away. I wished she had called me when she called my grandad and other aunt. 




My cousins were already there when I arrived. We each got some time alone with her, to say our goodbyes. She passed away 4:33AM. We all sat in her room until the doctor arrived to sign the death certificate, which didn't happen until 8:30AM. It wasn't very pleasant, as rigor mortis set in. She started releasing gas and bodily fluids. If we sat too close, we could smell it. She slowly got cold and when her hands changed colour, the nurses covered them with blankets so we wouldn't notice (but we did) 



Grandad went home to check on Lizzy and brought her in so she could say goodbye. I tell no word of a lie, she knew. We lifted her so she could sniff grannys face and we all burst into tears when Lizzy started licking at her face. She knew. She knew. 



Anyway. She passed on the 26th of February. Her funeral was held on the 28th of February. (As my aunt needed to return home) 
The most heartbreaking part? 
My birthday is on the 27th of February. I didn't feel like celebrating that year. And now my mum is always too depressed to celebrate my birthday. 



I still think about her often. I play the ukulele and attend a weekly group where we have sheets of music for everyone (80+ people) 
When her favourite song is in the set list, I get up and sing it for her.

Message from the Polish Border Guard:

>	Refugees fleeing war-stricken Ukraine are entering Poland regardless of their nationality. Although the dominant group in need of refuge in 🇵🇱 are 🇺🇦 citizens, the Border Guard also cleared nationals of countries such as the US, Nigeria, India, Georgia and others.

Honestly, I don’t know what’s going on. Both articles posted today. 

I’m guessing that they couldn’t get in before because guards only let in Ukrainian citizens, but arrangements have been made since?

@edit1

The first article actually mentions it (I missed it in the sea of all caps):

>	WE ARE ENGAGING VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS IN UKRAINE, POLAND AND RUSSIA TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF OUR NATIONALS OUT OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF UKRAINE.

>	THE GOVERNMENT IS AWARE OF THE ANXIETIES, CONCERNS, AND INDEED FRUSTRATIONS BEING FACED BY PARENTS AND GUARDIANS OF OUR CHILDREN, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAD ALREADY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE POLISH BORDER AND SADLY HAD TO SPEND THE NIGHT ALONG THE WAY.

Given how he will use his cult celebrity position to sick his rabid Nationalist Conservative (Nat-Cs for short) Stochastic Terrorists on the jurors it's doubtful he'll have a fair trial.

Maybe they'll have a military tribunal instead and dissappear him to some undisclosed base for the rest of his pitiful life. 🤞",2023-08-25 03:30:23
160j0z0,"Lifelong Dem. Voted for Trump '16. Would NEVER make that mistake again. Hate the job Dems and old man Joe are doing. He belongs in a retirement home IMO. I Live in CA and think Newsome is the Devil, he's a complete douchebag!

But don't make blanket statements like Democrats are done and say goodbye to our legacy. That's like saying Trump f'd off Reagan's greatness and legacy. Isn't true. 

It also sounds like some ominous threat. Adios? Hablo Español guey, y tú? Also, Republicans aren't the only gun totin' hillbillies you know. All this talk of Civil War from Republicans is stupid and nonsense. I wish you guys could see the truth about what Trump has done to us and our psyche. It's sad. 

God bless America, both parties, and all the great people, with all of our cultural differences, who make it up.  If you love America, I love YOU.

I am more than willing to admit the significant deficiencies of the current Democratic Party. Too bad more republicans can't do the same regarding Trump😔",2023-08-25 15:30:07

160j0z0,"You have a lot of feelings pent up. Sorry to hear. Trump really got you worked up. Oh well.

Like I said, I don't like the current state of the Democratic Party either. But all it takes is one great person and it can all be put back together. Too bad you don't see it that way.

And I don't mean one great Democrat, I just mean one great American leader.  That's all we need, and then you guys can calm down a bit. 

Let's be honest, there is so much more on the line here than politics. Fentanyl is destroying our youth, drugs and disobedience are rampant,  The traditional American values (upheld by both parties) are being shunned, families are no longer the functional norms,  we are trying to cancel each other left and right....  I feel similar to you, but I am just optimistic it can be changed. I know it can. We just need to take care of eachother and put our differences aside.

And FYI, I am not a little Redditor whatever you call to me.  I'm a 25 year plumber that recently got his license and started his own company and found out I can help dozens of people a day on this app. It fascinates me to see plumbing around the world and I love the feedback when I help people. That's it, plain and simple.

And for the record, my great uncle was Alfred Alquist,  a very prominent Democratic California politician.  That's why I say I'm a lifelong democrat, it's in my family. But that doesn't mean I die by the party and I certainly do not agree with the majority of what is happening in the party these days. I like to think my uncle would roll over in his grave if he saw the current state of the Democratic Party🙈🙉🙊 Notice I used monkeys, that's what I think of most of them. 

But ""Orange Man"",  As you yourself referred to him, is a divisive prick and deserves everything he gets for what he tried to do to our country.  I can admit my party's faults, why can't you admit yours, and we meet somewhere in the middle so we ALL can be proud Americans again.  And, oh yeah, fuck everyone else around the world and what they think of us. We can punch them in the mouth literally! That my friend is the American way. God Bless you and the U.S.A.!",2023-08-25 16:44:27
160j0z0,"IMHO, Donald is facing problems he created for himself. We will just have to disagree on him.

1axg3oe,"What a beautiful thing to open Reddit and see. 

I lived in Birmingham, Alabama for a few years, and there is a major children’s hospital there. I don’t know if it’s every year, but bikers do a Teddy Bear Rally ( I believe it’s St. Jude ) I was lucky enough to witness 1000’s of bikers driving to the hospital with 1000’s of Teddy Bears in every size, some bigger than the bikers themselves. As I write this it makes me tear up. So damn touching, such a precious memory for me. I wish you all happiness ❤️",2024-02-22 20:19:46

She measured it with a yardstick, it look like a horse dick

His dick is a chopstick, she call it a toothpick

My dick is a broomstick, his dick is a fish stick

This bitch is stupid thick, her pussy stupid slick

When I shined a bright light say 1,000 lumens in the pitch black to see this animal it looked at me with big red eyes up about 5-7ft off the ground. I yelled big & deep because my dog was there barking at it & the animal whatever it was...jumped off the limb tree & made big limbs break as it was (thankfully) running away.

In the past years we've heard extreme cat noises at night like a women screaming..
Also my Grandfather has told me here recently he has seen a big black cat near his shed that is bigger than a house cat. I asked him well could it be a bobcat? ""No, a bobcat has a visible pattern on it & its tan, this one was black with a big ole tail!"" He said.

What could it be?
What has big red shiny eyes with a wide eye bridge?

nestx2,"In war there are going to be casualties. But, the death of innocents is too much to bear. Unfortunately, Hamas and other radical jihadists hide behind human shields because they are cowards. While I don't agree with my fellow Hebrews in the stealing of lands from others, I do defend their need to defend themselves against people who fire a shot at them over the fact that they got offended because, they don't know how to think about anyone but themselves (especially the people they need to govern over). Even though I am part Hebrew, I feel for this Palestinian man and his dead daughter for Palestinians are our ethnic brothers and sisters. But, when you have been targeted for mass exterminations over the last 3 thousand years, you will deal with every threat with lethal force. I also feel for all the other Palestinian people who keep on getting caught up in these religious nutjobs' Jihad or religious wars. My prayers go to these people. 💯🙏",2021-05-18 15:38:40

I do not really keep myself informed on global politics to provide a country with exemplary regulation to provide as a pedagogue but honestly as an american permanent resident I am more and more less worried about getting my citizenship. I just know we can do better. But the people on top just maintain the legacy of prioritizing capital instead of social welfare. So now the top .1% of the WORLDS wealth holders are mor concerned about leaving the earth and setting up humanity's future in the cosmos rather than fixing up the mess they can surely provide for with their enormous wealth 🤷‍♂️ 

What to do here,  idk. But surely the preservation of capitalism won't sustain the human legacy for as long as we might expect.

My native country, thee,
Land of the noble free,

Thy woods and templed hills;
My heart with rapture thrills,

And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song;
Let mortal tongues awake;
Let all that breathe partake;
Let rocks their silence break,
The sound prolong.

Flag waving isn’t a thing anywhere near as much as in the states and we don’t have the ‘respect the flag’ thing, but chances are high whenever you see loads of flags being waved or outside someone’s house it’s got a nationalistic, right wing, BNP/EDL, gammon etc flavour to it. Particularly with England flags.

It’s a shame because i love seeing a Union Jack flying above buildings etc, but as you put it so well, it’s means something perverse.",2021-01-07 16:28:40

No probs, bro. I just really wanted to do the switcheroo. 😁

>But as you are a selfproclaimed gun fanatic maybe you can tell me what kind of weapon it was?

Honestly, I didn't see it and it would be impossible to say for certain without a close examination if it's an AR platform rifle. An assault rifle has at least 2 modes of fire, semi auto, bust fire, and/or full auto. Most civilian rifles can only do semi auto. However it is possible and very easy modify a civilian rifle to do full auto. Most people don't because the only way to do so legally is to buy parts that'll costs tens of thousands dollars.

However these guys were willing to break into the capital building, if they brought AR-15s then they may had illegally modified them as well. 

If it were the cops carrying the rifles, then they were almost certainly assault rifles.",2021-01-07 18:35:11

Like we were when we killed off the Native Americans with smallpox infected blankets the army handed out to them after kicking them out of their homes into the cold and forced them to walk westward. In comparison we were plague infected rats and German Nazis were plague free mice. So you are looking to the wrong country for help as we have elected Nazis that only care about white people. Rich white people that is. They are throwing me under the bus too. I'm white disabled and poor so they consider me a burden and a shame to our race. Wake up America.

kvvqvw,"Evil has had a lot of practice placing blame on others, conjuring up a scapegoat in any form. Everybody is still distracted from our real enemies, GOVERNMENT, RELIGION, CORPORATIONS: i.e. the powers that seek to control the world and upset the natural order. This is the true evil we face.

They've implemented propaganda tactics throughout every mainstream facet that most of us have access to, constantly aiming to confuse, overwhelm, anger, and scare. They hold your emotions hostage, making you think and behave how they want, to control you. They have all the power in all the media, its time for us to pull the plug and face reality. 

Dont let yourselves be deluded, let yourselves be disillusioned, let yourself be free. You just have to make a choice, one decision, one action, and you can change everything, but it all comes down to you. Your choice. You can set yourself free if you truly wish to, for where their is a will... there will ALWAYS be a way.

Ive learned all life is in a struggle for control, but that game requires a balance to function properly, a certain degree of fairness between its competitors. The rules have been tampered with and there is a growing imbalance that cannot be sustained. This massive imbalance is TEARING US APART, destroying our world, shattering our dreams of peace, love and freedom.

Shatter your beliefs in God. The truth is... There is no singular god, we are ALL gods. We all have the power to manifest anything from our imagination, to create our own rules, worlds, our own universes. Reality is a matter of perception, you must believe it to make it so. Your faith in yourself is your most powerful asset, share that faith in your comrades and we will become stronger than ever before. The people in power keep that 'secret' from you, they dont want you to know how powerful you are. That would risk them losing the control they so desperately covet, and so they steal it from the rest of us in the process. 

No matter what they say, no matter what they do, we can take it back. And I BELIEVE THAT WITH EVERY OUNCE OF MY BEING. Now... It's your turn. To take back control over your own life. Take back what was stolen from you. Reclaim your freedom. 

 I've been trying to figure out how to say this for years, I sincerely hope this gets to the right people.

So these BLM/ANTIFA PUNKS who joined in for lack of a better term with real TRUMP PATRIOTS, of which I'm one, & proceeded to damage a ""FEDERAL BUILDING"" & assault Police officers:
Excuse me but is not what they did a FEDERAL CRIME:

1.Breaking & Entering a Federal Building WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION.
2.Destruction of Federal Property
3.And From what I read & saw these P'sOS, & I mean the BLM/ANTIFA PUNKS also assaulted Capitol Police officers & at least one of those officers has died.

Are these not singly or altogether criminal acts?

I'll answer that,...Of coarse they are, and those that don't think they were criminal acts or any other violation of the law need to pull their heads outa their asses before it's too late!

All I'm saying is there are too many red flags for me to simply believe a green or blue check mark from an anonymous source who ""reports"" to a major news media company. Who are these fact checkers? Yes, some present their names, but the majority of them don't. Now, you and me both know it's bullshit to challenge me to show you every piece of evidence I've ever found to support whatever I'm supporting. Some of us have busy lives or higher priorities than to please a random internet stranger. I'm simply stating an observation of mine in hopes that others will also start to see it as well. You know, just like how 95% of reddit users (just guesstimating off observations) also state their ""observations"" in support of Joey or in hatred of Donald. Y'all can blow me into oblivion with down votes. It just reveals how biased reddit is. Again, just another observation.
However, his tattoos are a variation of a hammer (the 🪓) and a variation of a sickle (other hand), both Antifa symbols.

jhxybe,So the business owner that wanted to refuse to make a cake for the gay couple was right 🤔 or are we just going to pick and choose where this way of thinking applies.,2020-10-26 02:56:43

jhxybe,"Well it’s not your job as a private citizen to levy ‘CoNSeqUenCEs’ against people in your community for exercising their rights🤷‍♂️  It’s sufficient to say that “You don’t have any more rights than me, and I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone not wearing a mask.” 

I wear my mask when required by law or when requested to do so, never anytime else. I don’t believe it makes a difference. Fauci echoed that sentiment emphatically when this all started back in March. I do not understand the moral superiority complex people develop about this issue. COVID has a mortality of less than one percent for most of us. Countries like Sweden (that never locked down or mandated masks) experienced even lower mortality rates than that and avoided altogether the economic and social implications the rest of the world has faced. I understand that 200,000 Americans with medical complications *might* have been saved by masks, but I also understand that the lockdowns and economic turmoil are driving droves of predominantly healthy and predominantly young people like me  into depression and *suicide*. It’s my right to view the (over)reaction to this pandemic as the biggest most overblown snow job in the history of the world. 

I’ll wear a mask in your store because you asked me to, not because I’m okay with advertising my compliance through appeals to authority.",2020-10-26 00:09:36

jhxybe,">I'm definitely a person who hates being told what to do by another individual person.

Lol I'm the same way but only when the consequences are limited to me. Like, you don't get to tell me how to live my life as long as my choices don't interfere with your rights in any significant way. This is obviously different, anyone with a brain can see that not wearing a mask can have very serious consequences on many more people than just the one not wearing a mask.

The most vocal anti-masker I know irl is a lady who occasionally works for my mother. People who wear a mask in the street and at the wheel particularly tick her off. She goes on these endless tirades and keeps calling them sheep. The funny thing is she works in advertisement so she's constantly trying to tell said ""sheep"" what to buy, what lifestyle to have, how to look etc. and herd mentality is good and fine as long as it works to her advantage and makes her job easier. 

She also looks like some kind of middle aged barbie/paris hilton caricature who time travelled from 2005, purse dog included. Like, sure Susan, I can see you're totally your own person and not the result of clever marketing and peer pressure from 15 years ago. Thank God we got a true Freethinker™ here",2020-10-26 03:17:40

As soon as I see a whisper of it though the tinted moisturizer is coming out and my workouts are going from half assed to full throttle. EVERY guy I've seen that looks hot bald is jacked and tanned. Doesn't hurt to have facial hair (i dont... cant :-|  ). The best thing is that these things are fully in our control, except for stopid hairless face..   so ya, dont fear the bald, just get jacked and get tan in a bottle, sorted 👍",2020-07-11 11:21:27

Back when Star Trek the next generation the media was surprised by Roddenberry’s choice of Captain. The problem was... he was bald. A reporter stood up at the press conference and asked, “wouldn’t man have discovered a cure for male pattern baldness by then?”

Roddenberry simply replied, “no, by then they don’t care.” Implying it was the reporter being petty, and in the future your worth is based on merit and no looks. 

But you’re looking good ma man. 🤜🤛

Once again, you look good. Welcome to the club.

Where does it end, does another developer look at this development 30 years from now, and be like ""shit we could build X more houses here if we knock down these"" and remove their already paltry gardens and reduce it something like the size of a patio slab.

They had gallows, people who quite clearly had a plan to at least take hostages of officials, set up pipe bombs and clearly there was some 5th column/monkey wrenching duckers going on with some of the cops.

If they had gotten a little luckier than they did here and there it could have been way, way more deadly and dangerous. Could be a big state funeral going on.

Like, I’m not losing any sleep over it. I don’t care about National symbolism or any of that stuff, and if some congresspeople get merc’d it’s no greater tragedy to me than anyone else dying. 100k people die of starvation every day 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

They were never going to take over the country or get Trump named god emperor — it would have just resolved as a bloody failed coup rather than an absurd one, but it is what it is. A coup attempt, even with whatever modifiers.

This is all just an appetizer for what things are going to be like on the regular once the worst effects of climate change set in.

Yes, Net Neutrality is hugely important but right now the Republicans in the Senate are getting ready to ram through a tax bill that will increase the deficit by $1.5 Trillion, and the middle class will pay for it through increases in graduate student tax rates, cuts to Social Security/Medicare, and in general increasing our tax rates so the highest earners can get stupidly high deductions. It is urgent that we all call our Senators, especially those in red states (yes, mainly those who have taken money from telecom interests, you know who they are). Call you senators NOW and tell them to vote no on the #GOPTaxPlan. It takes 5 minutes!

** SENATE SWITCHBOARD: 202-224-3121 **

Request to be connected to your Senators. The script is easy: 

>Hello, I’m your constituent and I’m calling to urge you to vote **NO** on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Yes, many of them tried to take Trump to court. Aftet Trump used his wealth, power, and influence to harass them, they all had to stop pursuing the case. Kind of a pattern in Traitor Trump's life if you ask me.

fb5lk5,Personally I see myself as being born in February so I celebrate on the 28th. But it’s really personal preference. Now that I’m older I don’t really celebrate unless it’s an actual leap year🍻. Might get a special dinner but I’d rather make it special ever 4 years then pretend every year.,2020-02-29 08:35:20
fb5lk5,"My daughter just got all her hair chopped off a couple weeks ago (she's 8). We were walking past the place she gets her hair cut when she's with me and she refused to leave until we went in to say hi. So we go in, and she decides she NEEDS another haircut, and we're not going anywhere nicely until she gets it. She has zero patience for anything ever. It's just a quick walk-in place, but there were like 4 other people waiting. She plopped her butt down in a chair and looked at all the hair dressing books and waited patiently for like 25 minutes so she could get 1/8th of an inch trimmed off her goddamn bangs 😂

Today she was very concerned about what her old CEA was doing at school, and kept asking me where she was and what she was doing. After I dropped her off, she went and found her CEA, snuggled for a few minutes, and then ran off.

When she's angry, she's ANGRY. But when she's happy, she's just so full of love and silliness.",2020-02-29 06:11:58

mlrjt3,"You got this. Although i did not have cancer, i had a condition during pregnancy (hypermesis) that made me have the same side effects of chemo during 6½ months. I was taking all the pills to control the puking i could and nothing worked. By the end of the pregnancy, at 8 months i was puking every half an hour, about 12-15 Times a day.. it was rough but try to live One day at a time, think that if you can go through that you can deal with anything, and maybe try to find some humor in between.. i know its hard sometimes but maybe you could think to yourself in the Middle of the puking ""well the lunch was not good anyways so.."" or ""well this is a great way to eat shit and not get fat!"" 
Im jking but it was what saved me. When i started puking my housemates would mimic the sound and that made me smile even in the Middle of the chaos. It was hard, but it doesnt need to be ONLY hard. 

And i cant stress this enough - if you cant eat, if you cant stop puking like i did, SMOKE A JOINT! Even microdosing. Im very serious. It was the only thing that made the pain easier, that made my stomach chill the fuck out for some hours, made me hungry and when i ate, it would not come out. 
During pregnancy you.re supposed to gain around 16-20kg, i Lost 3kg. And if i did not smoke, i dont know if my baby would have nutrients getting to him, cause i couldnt even drink a sip of water without puking. Btw i was being meddically followed and they knew i was smoking. And they understood. I WISH YOU ALL FIGHTERS A LOT OF RESILIENCE. YOU GOT THIS. KEEP YOUR FAITH. TAKE ONE DAY AT A TIME. FIND HUMOR. DO THINGS YOU LOVE 🖤❤️🌈🌻☀️🌞💪",2021-04-07 09:12:39

a5i6ui,"I see this house is in Norway. I'm Norwegian and study climate change management and I'm wondering... Have you taken into account sea level rise? That seems awfully low in comparison with even conservative estimations of sea level rise for the next 50 years.

Like... The massive flood doors protecting Rotterdam will need substantial upgrades to not be ineffective post the 2070s.

Edit: I can easily see that plateau down there being under water during a 20 yr flood in 2050.

How high is your porch? Have you secured your foundation on stilts or anything? Floating foundation? (expensive, but very innovative).

Edit2: I'm no expert on this stuff, but these are my initial thoughts just after seeing the image.

Edit 3: Too OP. You can check your area's susceptibility for storm flooding by following the link in this news article here https://www.nrk.no/hordaland/na-kan-du-sjekke-om-huset-ditt-blir-rammet-av-stormflo-1.14297763

Thing is, I work in an emergency room, I see first hand what the professionals are doing and saying, it’s not hysteria, this is real. Because of where I work I need to isolate myself as much as possible to avoid possibly infecting others if I catch it.

▶️Talks into RING doorbell camera◀️

Delivery Guy- “So, Ma’am... You’re ok with me signing/initialing here for you as receipt that you received your groceries?”

Old Lady- “Why, of course. Thank you! Just leave them there by the step.”

▶️The End◀️


I think we’re making too much of this now. It’s a non issue, unless delivery drivers are refusing to drop off to people in need who refuse to sign. In that case, something needs to be done.

My mother is in a wheelchair following a severe stroke she suffered a few years back. I take care of her when I’m home, but am often gone for work for 2-3 days at a time and occasionally need to have food delivered for her when caregivers don’t show up as planned. She doesn’t have use of her right arm, and can’t write with her left... She literally CANNOT sign, and never has a single deliver driver made an issue of it.

6v6dqp,🌝🌖🌗🌘🌚🌒🌓🌔🌝,2017-08-21 22:38:54
6v6dqp,"☀️Poem Alert🌘

Through today's eclipse, God brought a pretty amazing thought to my mind...

The sun is always there. Always. Day in and day out without fail. It's so bright and powerful we can't really see eye to eye with it. In fact, to attempt to see it with the naked eye would be blinding. So, more often than not, we don't think about its presence. It's just there.

Cue the moon. The moon is relatively smaller than our sun. It doesn't shine unless the sun's light reflects off of its surface. It's not living and active like the sun. Yet, although smaller, less powerful, and without its own source of light, at the right distance, given its size, the moon can block all light from the sun if it comes between us. 

It's not until the moon moves back out of the way that we can relish in the heat and beauty of our bright star. If it were to remain in its place between us, the moon would deprive the earth of its greatest and most important source of energy for life. We would grow cold. We would freeze. We would die. 

Thankfully, the moon continued to move along today and our marriage with the sun, as displayed by the biggest and most beautiful of rings, was restored.

Too often I find myself focusing on the moon. Keeping it at a close distance. Forgetting that it is lifeless. Failing to remember that's it's nothing compared to our sun. 

Too often I fail to soak in the sun's rays. To feel its heat. To understand and acknowledge its presence. 

I allow the little things to get between me and the bigger picture. I focus on what's right in front of me. I forgot what and Who is behind it all. 

If this thought was all that today's magnificent display left me with, I'd be content! Because I know that, in Him, there's so much more. Much more splendor. Much more greatness. 

So look towards the Son. Remember the feeling. Feel the warmth of His embrace. And stay in awe!

PS.: I do not recommend looking at the sun, son.",2017-08-22 03:37:24

6suwhn,"So when I was a teen was part of a Southern Baptist church youth group. Every year we did a ""home mission"" trip, a bunch of youth and adults would go to another state and spread the word to those not fortunate enough to hear it everyday from their local churches. One year we decided to make the trip to the very den of Satan, New Orleans. So every night for a week we would stand in the center of Bourbon Street with one adult holding a massive wooden cross shouting about the love of Jesus while the rest of us would mingle with the crowds passing out religious tracks and harassing party goers about the Lord. It was about as effective as you could imagine.

Towards the end of the week we were all pretty burned out from being so persecuted by the heathens we were ready to call it quits. We then got word that a Slayer concert had just let out and we better start praying because this was obviously the reason God had sent us there. I knew who the band was and knew of their Satan worshipping fans so I braced myself. Then down the street they came, head bangers, metal heads, hell on earth. I gathered up my courage and began my ministering. Most brushed us off politely, some laughed in our face (this was a pretty typical response from everyone that week) and others said that they had already accepted the Lord as their saviour, which was just odd to teenage me. 

Sometime later I was standing by the sidewalk and I hear a girls voice from above call to me. Above on the balcony of one of the bars were a small group of nice dressed, white, obviously Christian college girls. They asked sweetly what I was doing and I told them I was spreading the Good Message. They asked me to come up and talk to them about it and I had to decline because it was a bar. So come closer they said so they could hear better. I thought, ""ok that makes sense"" and I stepped further up the sidewalk directly under them on the balcony. As I looked up I was greeted by face full rank beer and the laughs of those good Christian girls. I was stunned. Then seemingly out of nowhere big arms grab my shoulders and a loud voice shouts, ""That's enough! He's just a fucking kid!"" I turn around and see this huge dude with long hair and beard,  wearing a Slayer shirt and covered in tattoos. ""Let's get you out of here little dude"" he says, and takes me back to my youth minister with the wooden cross. I'm off to the side as this big metal head is laying into my pastor about his lack of responsibility letting kids just run around Bourbon Street in the middle of the night. Youth minister had nothing to say and the dude gives me a nod and goes away.

Dude will never know it but something clicked that night when this supposed Satanist (I know he probably wasn't a Satanist) treated me like more of a human than people who I thought were ""my kind."" 

P.S. I'm better now. Hail Satan. 😈",2017-08-10 20:53:59

When was the last time you saw a female lion being the alpha while a bunch of males ran around hunting and taking care of the cubs?

kt7zzg,"I don’t disagree, but I think even more important to trump than skin color is loyalty and adoration.  He has Narcissistic Personality Disorder, no doubt in my mind.

You’re skeptical you say? Check off which symptoms fit Trump:


✅Have an exaggerated sense of self-importance

✅ Have a sense of entitlement and require constant, excessive admiration 

✅ Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant it

✅ Exaggerate achievements and talents

✅ Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate

✅ Believe they are superior and can only associate with equally special people

✅ Monopolize conversations and belittle or look down on people they perceive as inferior

✅ Expect special favors and unquestioning compliance with their expectations

✅ Take advantage of others to get what they want

✅ Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others

✅ Be envious of others and believe others envy them

✅ Behave in an arrogant or haughty manner, coming across as conceited, boastful and pretentious

✅ Insist on having the best of everything — for instance, the best car or office

✅ Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special treatment

✅ Have significant interpersonal problems and easily feel slighted

✅ React with rage or contempt and try to belittle the other person to make themselves appear superior

✅ Have difficulty regulating emotions and behavior",2021-01-09 05:56:32

mja4wy,"/u/GovSchwarzenegger  [signed this](https://i.redd.it/qpos7710aaf61.jpg).  OP posted that to Instagram (pavelsokov).  Per there:

> @schwarzenegger with his painting that I made for him! Thank you for the awesome photo! My dad and I used to watch Arnold movies together when I was a little kid in Russia. It had questionable Russian dubbing but we had a great time 😂. He was my favorite actor. Later in my life he became an inspiration (people that knew me back then, do you remember this?) for following and accomplishing multiple dreams that many around him deemed unlikely. A long time ago, before I became a professional artist, I was my own nay-sayer, thinking that it’s unrealistic to become a successful painter because almost no one does. I was listening to an epic speech of Arnold’s back when I was still working in business and was struck by his complete disinterest in the high likelihood of failure of his goals, massive as they were. He said to fear nothing, to believe in yourself and in your vision, and go out there and get it done regardless. Message was received. Thank you. I quit my business job at the time and moved to California to pursue my goals. Real life only started when I went to pursue exactly what I want, in many ways. I barely even remember life prior, because it was the life of a different person. The mission was accomplished almost immediately, so nowadays I just keep moving the goal post higher and higher. The idea of being afraid to follow your seemingly unlikely dreams seems laughable and I understand completely that the only thing to fear is fear itself. Every mountain will be climbed in due time, you just gotta make sure to not run out of mountains to climb

hg8f79,Someone in his chosen neighborhood (seriously-I could barely afford to Look at the area!) finally became curious enough they took him in to be scanned. Then they called everyone in the phonebook in that city with my last name. They reached my grandma who told them they were on the wrong side of the river for it to be my cat. Then the second she hung up she realized why would they know my name? So (in 1995 when people still read the newspaper) I managed to get an article in something everyone read on Saturdays. The people who had him scanned saw it and called me. I’m so grateful to them! He made it home-was spoiled rotten! (and for the record when I got him back he was sleekly beautifully muscled with a gorgeous coat. Obviously people have been feeding him in their backyards & made sure he had safe areas). 🙂,2020-06-26 19:10:55

ghq1n2,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand armed Black Panther protesters. The history is extremely nuanced, and without a solid grasp of class and race warfare history most of the nuance will go over a typical person's head. There's also their revolutionary outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation- their personal philosophy draws heavily from Marxist literature, for instance. The redditors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these nuances, to realise that they're not just nuanced- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike armed protesters truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the BPP's catchphrase ""Show Them What Community Looks Like"", which itself is a cryptic reference to Ferguson's epic 2014 protests. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Louis Farrakhan's genius wit unfolds itself on their public streets. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Black Panthers tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the commies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2020-05-11 18:48:52

fiby6i,"These people make me sick. If I saw this here, in Utah, I would definitely say something along the lines of: 

- ""I'm so glad you can afford the whole toilet paper section. Does it make you feel good knowing that people at risk, people with families, and people with disabilities who can't get to the store without help, are not going to have ANY toilet paper at all, because of you?""  

We should be filming this shit, someone should start a blog or website, and post pictures and videos of this behaviour. People don't like being called out, and maybe, just maybe, we can slow down the panic if we can show the world just how barbaric they are behaving. How selfish. Entitled. 

Also. The price of bidets is going up. I wish I had bought one the other day, when it was only $31 instead of $52 now. I only have $35 in my bank account, due to buying enough food and a few extra supplies to get me through self-isolation. And it wasn't much. I often don't have anything to spare, because my whole disability check goes to rent, utilities, my phone bill and a little extra food when food stamps run out. 

Thankfully, my ex-roommate and friend, is sharing her Netflix and Disney + with me so I don't go completely insane 😂",2020-03-14 07:30:01

Now in time's like this, holy crap I'm lucky to afford a package of toilet paper, tissue and other needs not wants. On top of that I'm in the high risk category, near 60 and have lung issues. Good thing I live in the middle of nowhere. I live alone with 4 dog's. Have told my family and friends, call please don't visit. Now what?? I'm not going to freak out. Look I'm not afraid to die. I don't go many places anyway and I do not like crowds. All I'm saying is hoarding anything really hurts many other people. Don't panic, so many more survive than die. These are the times we are supposed to help each other, not rob one another or make it so others cannot have the basic needs. This is when you should check on your neighboes, the elderly to see if they have what they need. See if those who live alone are ok. You don't have to make close contact, call or stop by and don't get close. Be careful, but have compassion. An to the hoarders, crooks and idiots, we will know and remember who you are. Your time will come, you reap what you see. Always remember that. Some day you will be the one in crisis. God Bless 🙏 everyone, Take Care and Good Health 😁🇺🇸",2020-03-14 15:27:57

But then my store doesn't stock it all year - we try to leave it out but after a certain point when its gone, it's gone - so...

If they DO normally carry it all year it's possible somebody just screwed up and they're that far down the wait list. Or, if the vendor sends it to a distribution center and then the DC sends it out it might have gone to the wrong store - that always seems to take FOREVER to sort out - and now they have to wait for the next load or something.

Or there's a delay on the vendor's side.

p1bohm,"The same thing is happening in Aus, my home state of Tasmania had an increase of spiny sea urchins as a result of rising ocean temperatures. The kelp forests were dilapidated and the urchins continue to breed like crazy. 

But as in your case, there are measures and incentives launched by government and businesses to tackle this problem and restore the environment. We are an island state with an economy that relies heavily on our oceans and coasts, so time and effort has been dedicated to finding [solutions](https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/sea-fishing-aquaculture/sustainable-fisheries-management/fisheries-management-strategies/long-spined-sea-urchin-strategy), which include: 

repopulating rock lobster stocks - a natural predator of the urchins that usually live amongst the kelp.

Creating diving experiences for locals and tourists to wield spears and smash urchins! 

Also providing subsidies for the purchase of urchins, mostly overseas, as they are considered a delicacy in places like China.

So yes, it’s a sad sight and representative of the rapidly changing climate. I suppose the message here is we shouldn’t feel powerless to take action! Find hope where you can and do your best to make a difference 🦞🐠🌿",2021-08-10 05:22:22

8po23h,"For those of you who think this is an Uber ad, it isn’t. Believe it or not, some people are kind to one another for no good reason. This was my response to another person who assumed my sons account was hacked by an ad agency:

It’s 100% real. I can vouch for super_slide, I’m his mom❤️.  Sometimes people can be nice to one another because it’s the right thing to do, and not because they want more ‘likes’ or ‘upvotes’ or ‘stars/ratings’.  My son was probably in shock yesterday and Beni saw that he needed someone with him, so he didn’t hesitate to stick around to ease his mind. When my son got to the hospital Beni noticed he had a Colorado DL and asked if he has family in Austin— when my son said no Beni stayed with him because he said he knew what it felt like to be alone without family (Beni’s from the Congo).  Even after a family member arrived at the hospital Beni hung out and talked, so they invited him to dinner. He even invited my son over for dinner once he’s feeling better. It’s called being civil and kind to one another. 

Yes. The current world news cycle can wear you down and make you cynical of anything that seems to good to be true (why would a complete stranger help my son?). Luckily, Beni is the real deal. 

Also shout out to the girl who saw my son wipeout, called Uber for him and safely kept his backpack and skateboard. They didn’t have time to exchange names/numbers but she found his name inside his backpack, found him on FB and returned his belongings to him— yep. TWO nice people— imagine that. Think about what would happen if EVERYONE said or did one nice thing each day, just to be nice and make someone else feel good. What a beautiful world it would be. 

The world needs more Beni’s for sure❤️❤️❤️

Anyway, I found it right next to a school bus drop off where kids were and also next to a city park. How it got there, I have no idea. There was a suspicious house nearby that I heard sold at one point.  I wasn’t going to let a kid find it so I picked it up, went home and called the cops.  Well, 👮‍♀️Officer Dickface 👮‍♀️ comes to my house to check it out and pick it up AND THEN tells me that technically, I could be charged with possession of a felony amount of narcotics. Plus I got a lecture on the dangers of fentanyl, etc.  That’s why I picked it up with a dog poop bag, shithead.  I couldn’t believe this.  He wraps it up and drives off. Um, there were kids all over the place. You’re welcome, prick.

Pro tip: if you *truly* find someone’s opinion “worthless,” you can instead choose to ignore it completely instead of wasting your precious time responding with how much you don’t care!

And before you try to pull a gotcha on me for commenting, I don’t care that you’re an insufferable cunt, but I dislike when other people are put down for no reason. Because, unlike you, I don’t immediately jump to someone being a *waste of oxygen* because I disagree with them 🤷‍♂️

But let me do you an even further favor, and also block you, so you don’t feel tempted to waste any more of your obviously very important time on something so lowly as to comment on the affairs of us mere plebeians!",2022-12-28 00:56:39

It was so cringey because Carlson and Begala, two people who have no professional interests in having even a scripted debate with Jon, basically thought they were going to have a fun time bashing a comedian who moonlights on a show about politics on “The Comedy Central ©”. Nay.

Sure, Jon had only been doing TDS for 5 years at that point, but to say he was politically under-informed or naive or even a nuance to the entertainment news industry would be shorting him plenty of credit where credit was due. And he proved that. Because he went in there while those two chucklefucks basically grinned and tried to uncomfortably laugh through the whole guest spot and Jon deconstructed the show’s entire narrative. That’s why they got canceled. Because at the end of the show, the producers were basically like...”anywhere we go from here, he’s basically gonna be right and just call it out on his show”.

Which includes the mayor, who is responsible for their city. 

However, The President, isn’t responsible for states nor cities or anything else. ]

cz75gj,"This is why we have the 2a. Its not for hunting, its not for home defense. Its to keep power in check. Period. This is why people are so after the ""assault"" weapons ban. They attack visual features like a pistol grip. Which actually makes the gun safer, also it keeps recoil down. So all the 120 pound 5'8 men and just about every woman can fire it effectively. Thats it. Nothing more nothing less. The AR series in 5.56 is also kinda a shitty bullet for killing. The projectile is about as big as a 22 cal pellet or a 22lr bullet. A 308 deer rifle is ten thousands time worse in damage, same as the rolly polly 7.62 round in most russian rifles. (mosin etc)

What do I see? I see millions of HK doing what america did to england, what they want is freedom and democracy. Its why thry are waiving our flag. 

Pretty sad state of affairs when people across the globe wish they had our freedom, our laws, more then the elected assholes we vote in. 

Im a law and order person. Im a libertarian. What i see in china, europe, mexico where guns are ""illegal"" makes me cringe. School shootings.. Today in china a man stabbed and killed the shit out of a bunch of kids in school. 🙃 last year a guy set off a bomb in a school. Gun control and freedom should go hand in hand. A lot of this violence is coming from our hands off approach to mental illness and the over prescription of drugs like SSRI's which cause violence as a side effect. 

I am watching HK, im sickened by american politics not standing more up to china. Everyone bashes trump, at least hes saying fuck you to them. Personally china is supplying america with Fentanyl, i say lets ship every man woman and child in HK and Taiwan a AR and 500 rounds of ammo. 

Offically fuck China and the genocide they are committing. 

And yes muslims, Buddhist, christians I know wheat hey have and continue to do to you. 

Yeah so whatever reddit... Down vote the fuck out of this im fine with being me.",2019-09-03 19:51:21

kczmsn,"The word ‘racist’ has a specific definition and this ain’t it chief. Racism is a belief in the superiority of one race over another. Are you really saying that choosing a black nurse as the first to be vaccinated represents a belief in the superiority of black people over others? 😭😭
How do we even know she was chosen rather than she was the first to volunteer? Would these racial considerations be part of this conversations if she was white instead, or would it be assumed she was chosen because of some other non-racial reason?
I think people like you focus too much on race.",2020-12-14 19:43:29
kczmsn,"100%. I am in SC it wasn’t bad here til summer. But I kept thinking I had IBS. Now that the dust has settled I realized I literally developed an eating disorder I was so stressed from March - august. I lost 43 pounds, I couldn’t eat things unless they were “safe” foods because I was so scared of getting sick so I was severely restricting calorie intake. I hate to say that the old adage is true, “you just get used to it.” But now casually walking down hallways where all 14 rooms you just walked by patients are proned and on a vent doesn’t bother me. I don’t like it, but I don’t think about it when I come home. And it only took 9 months for my anxiety to decrease!!!! 🙄",2020-12-14 18:26:57

kczmsn,"It's one thing to be in a terrible situation within a world class healthcare system, with a stable and relatively well-managed government. In Australia, we were able to ration ventilators and equipment, we didn't have to choose who would may survive between two previously well people, and then make that decision countless times a day. We didn't have to see hundreds of our colleagues die in front of us. We also had most of the population doing The Right Thing™ and respecting the rules. 

Now imagine that terrible situation without enough equipment, an imbecile telling everyone it's all going to be okay and stirring up the public with conspiracies and ridiculous interpretations of science, and a none-too-small portion of the population denying it even exists or it's not deadly.
Then you get to see your colleagues, friends, family, and/or parents die.
Long shifts of this, for months on end. 
And you get sick. 
You wonder if it was at home, or at work that you caught it. 
And if you survive, how do you go back to work and do it all over again?

And I haven't even touched upon the developing nations.

Based on his writing, it looks like the landlord might be a bit older. It would most likely really mean a lot to him as well if you let him know how thankful you were for the nice gesture.  I see a few comments on here saying, “hold on to the card in case something happens in the future,” essentially eluding to him possibly reneging on the partial rent, but kindness begets kindness.  

It’s easy to feel like our words don’t hold any weight or aren’t important, but they are. Let him know how thankful you are ❤️",2020-12-27 02:00:34

This is one of those things I would send in an email or something to my landlord, thanking them for their generosity and how much it means to you with what struggles you've been facing. This is a CYA move and if it really was the landlord - great! You get to send them a well deserved thank you. If it was not the landlord - also great because you get to save yourself from a headache later.

l4v09v,"I find these women to be a gift from heaven lol.  You can easily recognize them by the way they dress, the fact that they wear sandals or black army boots, that weird cat lady smell, the color of their hair (usually pink, blue, green, bright red etc) and you just know to keep away from their poison personality. 

On the other hand if a woman is dressed like a woman, you should always flash her a smile and if she smiles back approach. 
Avoid the angry marxist Antifa weirdos at all costs 😝

Edit: I don't get the angry downvotes over my comment. You don't want men to approach you and men want to stay as far the fuck away from you as possible.  That's a win win.  The only reason we do approach you sometimes is because sometimes it's hard to tell if you're an angry antisocial nutjob.",2021-01-25 21:55:39

Although I never engage unless I have a reason to.

But strangers on the bus have made endless bus rides way more enjoyable when I was back home for the holidays. I met a woman who was ship captain, another who was English teacher at uni, a couple of students and a hiker visiting while working remote.

The first one I asked for directions when the bus’s tire broke, because she was one of the few who seemed to know where to go, so I followed along and we talked on the rest of the ride. The second one we’d waited 40 min for a bus that was horribly late, and after 30min I let out a complaint, she commiserated and then we proceeded to smalltalk during the ride. It went similarly for the others (without the transportation issues lol), but it might have helped that everyone was more or less on holidays and not on their daily commute. I also never sat down next (unless invited), but on the seat across, so they get some space and a chance to ignore me, but we can still keep talking, which is usually how it goes.

Now that I say it, it was mostly women for some reason, but I guess I’m not the most macho man around and they don’t feel threatened. Dudes often just talk less.

In my way back to the airport, it was a woman with two little girls. I was minding my own business when suddenly one of them shows me her drawing and starts explaining it to me x)

Never happens here in Stockholm though — last time was when I overheard (ok maybe I was eavesdropping) a family speaking my mother tongue saying something to the effect of “That Gullmarsplan Station is really far”, so I had to inform them that we already passed it — and we chatted till the next station, it was the only polite way to act anyway, but I was happy to see some fellow countrymen.

Happened another time with non-Swedes also, when we realised we were headed to the same event :D",2021-01-26 10:08:09

Im from a small hometown with very disrespectful and ridiculous Christians. Suuuuure, they love everyone, but don't accept homosexuality or anyone of color?? Excuse me? We should be asking: What Would Jesus Do? 
Tf outta here, hypocrites. I'm enjoying my Gospel Church who accepts EVERYONE no matter black or white. Gay or Straight. I questioned to ever again step foot in a church for years until I stumbled upon this one with a friend to support him after his mother passed away. I don't regret it one bit. 
And for anyone who doesn't believe, that's ok. I'm not going to force my beliefs on you because I believe my God would never do such a thing to pure pressure someone to believe in what I believe.

I'm gearing up and ready to be attacked in the comments along with pitchforks and holy water, BRING IT ON! But I sincerely thank whoever posted this. Some people need this wake up call. Tbh, I do not believe in practiced religion to prove my worth to God. I love God and enjoy praying to him without attending Church every Sunday. I enjoy going to holiday services every year and I still do atm.

🤔

You say a lot but from your words I'm almost certain that you aren't in a relationship right now and that women wear the pants in your relationships. I warn you that you should learn better before moving even one step further because you don't seem to know much which means you will experience some bad situations with women in your future...

Edit: Damn this blew UP! Feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions or would like to know more! Happy park cleaning 😊

Edit edit: I promise I didn't pawn my job off on the public lol. I'm a **safety inspector** so trash pickup isn't one of my daily duties. Just wanted to thank the guests who did and spread the word about the most eco friendly viral hashtag campaign ever. 

Edit x100: I got my rivers/parks messed up since I go to so many. This is **Bullfrog Creek** at a small community park known in Riverview, not Alafia or Hillsborough river (though those rivers do have skinny/shallow ""creek"" parts that look just like this too!). 

Keep those PMs coming if I miss your question!

i4r2hg,"I worked in Oncology for several years.  Nothing will change your life like it.  That argument you had that morning with your husband on who needed to take the dogs out, means NOTHING.  Burger King got your order wrong and you didn't notice till you were home.  NOTHING.  Annoyed that you had to put in 2 extra hours to make sure that a patients claim is properly taken care of...NOTHING but thanks to God for being healthy enough to have helped.  It's those patients who come in and hug you for helping them, those old couples who hold hands as they walk down that hallway to the chemo room, PRAYING that their spouse doesn't die, those patients who come to your office JUBILANT because their scan came back clean.  THOSE are the things that matter.  And you do not see sex, color, religion, financial status, bad teeth, horrible hair, accents, bad grammar...you see a human.  Your brother, sister, mom or dad and it makes you realize how lucky you are and it makes you strive to do better by them.  (My apologies for the long post.  I am passionate about Cancer Research) If you really want to help, LLS (leukemia, lymphoma society) is an AMAZING charity.  They actually HELPS the patients.  Its not the higher ups banking and give a little to the sick folks.  Or go to your local cancer facility.  Most have an in house charity that helps with rent, electric, meds, etc.  Ours was 84% to the patients.  And if you are a patient, talk to the financial counselor and/or social worker.  They can find ALL SORTS of additional assistance for copay/coinsurance help as well as help with rent, car pmt, electric, food.  Don't let financial instability be part of your illness.  🖤",2020-08-06 18:35:45

The terminology that is getting used around the office and in official office emails is: “Practice social distancing, be hygienic” blah blah blah. They are blindly following the governments information; my opinion is that sending workers home means productivity dip as my industry (engineering and civil sector) requires work in hand to be followed up into proposal stage etc to keep the ball rolling - it feels like this is what the gov is doing to stave off a recession by not shutting down or severely limiting person traffic into the city.

8rrgq3,"I’m confused as to why we need to see it. I mean, none of us know you personally. So, why aren’t you posting this to Facebook? It’s nice and all, but the whole “posting my dead family member” is getting old. It seems anytime this sub pops up on the home feed, it’s always one of these posts. Judging by your post history, (and yeah, when it comes to stuff like this, *I’m that guy*) you don’t really see much of a difference between this and Facebook, and your viral post counts for most of your karma, which too is a Facebook post. 

I beginning to see a pattern here.

8rrgq3,"My uncle died earlier this year, it was the most cruel thing I ever witnessed.

8rrgq3,"Thank you for sharing your story. I’m crying reading this right now. I’m so sorry for your loss, I never knew that’s what PD was like. Years ago I was in an accident and I needed help showering and getting on the bed etc. It was so demoralizing feeling like I couldn’t even help myself do a simple thing like take a shower. Thankfully that was only temporary and I’m fully recovered, but I can only imagine what your dad went through. He was so strong and he loved you very much. Have an internet hug from a stranger 💛",2018-06-17 17:55:45
8rrgq3,You deserve it. Rock on ✌🏻,2018-06-17 17:43:08
8rrgq3,"Thank you for the internet hug and sincere empathy ❤️. PD stole my Dad before he actually died. A lot of people I have an experienced it don’t understand what that’s like. Instead of worrying about my SATs, I was feeding my father, and pushing around in a wheelchair. Instead of going on my first dates, I was in emergency rooms fearing the lethal threat of pneumonia... 

I wish more people knew the complete, long-term effects of PD, PD dementia, Alzheimer’s, Lewes Body Dementia, and other “elderly” illnesses (which can affect younger folks in an early-onset form...). 

I remember a girl my high school said, “Parkinson’s is just the natural loss of memory when you age? Right?” She was confusing Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, and she was completely incorrect about the latter. It’s not just “aging,” you lose your entire memory; which- as Westworld explores- is central to personality and relationships. With PD and Lewe’s Body, you lose your ability to control your muscles. With both (dementia and a neuromuscular illness) you lose your whole sense of self, your ability to move, your memory oof how to carry out simple tasks... 

It’s so much more insidious than some want to face. My father couldn’t even gave it; he denied he was sick to the very end. 

The fact that there still societal stigma and ignorance around these issues is really disheartening. I hope that sharing my story helped raise awareness just a little bit ❤️

",2018-06-17 19:07:14
8rrgq3,"I’m so sorry to hear this. I wish more people were aware of early-onset PD. Praying everyday for a cure and more research of one. I hope no one has to lose a loved one to this cruel, long-term illness. You have my complete sympathy ❤️",2018-06-17 19:11:19
8rrgq3,"I’m sorry you had to learn via this forum. I wish I knew more about the illness when my dad was diagnosed. If I known more, I would’ve treasured my time with him a lot more than I did... I also would’ve known more about treatment options (there is no cure; learning ways to better live with it). I would have gotten him into a Dance for PD class (where I currently work; allowing participants to escape the prison of their bodies for an hour and fifteen minutes) which he would have loved (he would have flirted with all the other women in the program; and had more peer support). 

I hope this has been helpful ❤️",2018-06-17 19:09:51
8rrgq3,"My 13th without my dad.
Big Fish is my favorite to watch when I’m thinking about him ❤️",2018-06-17 16:52:44
8rrgq3,"I hope you find peace in that moment. Know that your memories and love carry through, keep pushing 🤙🏼",2018-06-17 17:05:18
8rrgq3,"I worked in the memory care unit of a nursing home for three years right before my accident. I saw all that first hand and every day was so heartbreaking. 


I don’t believe I ever saw a resident with PD so I didn’t know it was at that same level as Alzheimer’s and dementia etc. It was so hard seeing a young residents, like people in their forties and just watching the toll that the disease takes on them. Or just hearing the residents ask for their family or try to go home but family rarely visit because I’m sure it’s difficult to watch that happen to someone you love. 


So I have so much admiration for you and really commend you for sticking it out with your dad and sacrificing your life to spend the time with him. I’m sure at times you felt like you didn’t have a choice but you made the choice that a lot of people wouldn’t have made. My heart is pouring out for you and I hope this father’s day is a little easier ❤️",2018-06-17 20:26:58
8rrgq3,My condolences 😢,2018-06-17 17:05:27
8rrgq3,"Reddit is such a funny place. Get upvotes for being cruel to others and get downvoted for trying to be compassionate because you never know what a person is struggling with. I lost my mom to suicide and my family doesn’t know what pushed her to do it. It happened one night out of nowhere; no note or anything. She and my stepdad got home from dinner and a couple hours later she was gone. I always wondered if someone said something cruel to her when they were out and it was the last straw for her because she was already struggling so badly with depression. 

So, no matter what anyone thinks, cruelty isn’t the answer. Calling someone abnormal or saying they wonder what their father would think of them now is unconscionable. So what if someone does seek attention from social media? Maybe some positive and sympathetic commentary is what they need at that moment to feel able to go on. 

Let em be ♥️",2018-06-17 19:51:49

Heaven would surely represent the pinnacle of pure, unbridled happiness and freedom. At first glance, you would think that they wouldn't grease-up the utility poles on the good boy side of the pearly gates because hey, you lived a good life and darn it you've earned the right to your celebratory riot.

However, perhaps some of the fun is merely in the *attempt* to climb the pole *despite* it being greased. Which of the two would bring more joy - an ungreased pole, or a greased pole pulled down by a zealous, angelic fan in the hereafter?

So now it comes down to several questions: are there utility poles in heaven? Would they be greased or ungreased in the event of a sports riot by the dearly departed? Why aren't the poles currently occupied by countless angelic strippers? 🤔",2018-02-05 09:00:20

Edit: lol I am well aware the government cannot control the climate. I’m just saying with being born under an insane and awful dictatorship(s), adding the weather looking so depressing all the time it just sounds awful. Ik the government doesn’t just have a remote that controls the sun 😭. 

Now while reading some actually interesting comments, it’s good to know that North Korea actually can be beautiful. It’s just like I said, whether it be from western media, random photographers, or North Koreans themselves it’s always looks so gray and cold cause that’s really all they show to us.",2024-03-24 15:26:51

It typically takes our customer service reps a week or so to process an order and send it down the pipe for us to pick /pack and ship it. Which doesn't take long.. But with shipping and everything. Two to three weeks. But my thoughts are that stores like Walmart will be getting resupplied by a major distribution center??.. If that's the case. We ship out to our smaller branches across the US and Canada two to three times a week, and they process and print the delivery orders on the spot.. So fingers crossed..

“It’s been a huge amount of whiplash,” he said. “From being in a situation where what I’ve got coming and going could potentially put my family in a really good place financially to ‘What the heck am I going to do with all of this?’”

Mr. Colvin is one of probably thousands of sellers who have amassed stockpiles of hand sanitizer and crucial respirator masks that [many hospitals are now rationing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/health/coronavirus-n95-face-masks.html), according to interviews with eight Amazon sellers and posts in private Facebook and Telegram groups from dozens more. Amazon said it had recently removed hundreds of thousands of listings and suspended thousands of sellers’ accounts for price gouging related to the coronavirus.

Amazon, eBay, Walmart and other online-commerce platforms are trying to stop their sellers from making excessive profits from a public health crisis. While the companies aimed to discourage people from hoarding such products and jacking up their prices, many sellers had already cleared out their local stores and started selling the goods online.

Now both the physical and digital shelves are nearly empty.

Mikeala Kozlowski, a nurse in Dudley, Mass., has been searching for hand sanitizer since before she gave birth to her first child, Nora, on March 5. When she searched stores, which were sold out, she skipped getting gas to avoid handling the pump. And when she checked Amazon, she couldn’t find it for less than $50.

“You’re being selfish, hoarding resources for your own personal gain,” she said of the sellers.

Sites like Amazon and eBay have given rise to a growing industry of independent sellers who snatch up discounted or hard-to-find items in stores to post online and sell around the world.

These sellers call it [retail arbitrage](https://www.wsj.com/articles/webs-most-maniacal-bargain-hunters-1428619524), a 21st-century career that has adults buying up everything from limited-run cereals to [Fingerling Monkeys](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-reveals-amidst-holiday-shopping-hustle-cyber-bots-are-expanding-reach-and-unfairly-scooping-up-the-hottest-holiday-toys-before-parents-can-even-click-buy-hard-to-find-toys-are-then-listed-on-third-party-sites-for-hundreds-of-dollars-senator-pushes-retailers-to-block-the-bots-), a once hot toy. The bargain hunters look for anything they can sell at a sharp markup. In recent weeks, they found perhaps their biggest opportunity: a pandemic.

As they watched the list of Amazon’s most popular searches crowd with terms like “Purell,” “N95 mask” and “Clorox wipes,” sellers said, they did what they had learned to do: Suck up supply and sell it for what the market would bear.

Initially, the strategy worked. For several weeks, prices soared for some of the top results to searches for sanitizer, masks and wipes on Amazon, according to a New York Times analysis of historical prices from Jungle Scout, which [tracks data for Amazon sellers](https://www.junglescout.com/amazon-product-research-resources/). The data shows that both Amazon and third-party sellers like Mr. Colvin increased their prices, which then mostly dropped when Amazon took action against price gouging this month.",2020-03-15 00:45:10

1b9rz4m,"You’re awesome! ❤️ You’re both real cute together, too. 
My previous love has alopecia. I’d have done the same but something tells me my hair might not match her darker complexion. We used to joke about this together being an interracial couple. She could grow her hair in patches. Something about it, I thought it was extra cute. She preferred to be bald. Understandably so. I must say, she owned it! I mean, just absolutely beautiful and the greatest smile! I’d help her shave spots she might have missed and I’d even take care of her pimples and ingrown hairs for her (which was huge for me because I find it disgusting unless it’s my own body. This is how much I loved her. Lol :P) 

Few years ago I donated 2 strands of 18” and 1 16” strand to wigs4kids. It was a great feeling. I’d like to do it again in the future.

Take it as you wish if you're into crypto so much that you're deliberately ruining our own currency value you are undermining your rights... let's say we buy crypto right when the US dollar crashes obviously right?

a4x6gx,"I'm super late to the party, but... Story time!

A few years ago I got 12 days off work to go and backpack/explore/camp out in the Gobi desert... A long time dream of mine. So I grabbed a flight from where I live (Seoul), and jetted out to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

On that flight I get seated next to this Mongolian lady who was maybe a couple years older than me. I was probably about 31 at the time. She was flying back home, and had been living for 2 years in New York, studying. She had not seen her family in all that time, had since had a baby, and was just exhausted. At that point, she had been flying all the way from New York, and had her last transfer in Seoul, which is where I boarded.

So bear in mind, that we've got about a four-hour flight, but she's already been flying for at least 20 hours. She was a wreck. And worse still, she has a 10 month old child that is just plain having a bad time. To say this woman was flustered, would be such an understatement.

She immediately feels bad for the guy that got seated next to her noisy kid, but truly, I couldn't have been in a better mood that day. I really only felt bad for her. So after some pleasantries, I start to play with the kid while she's sitting in her lap. Daughter stops crying, and that makes mom so happy. She looks so dead exhausted, so finally I ask if I can hold her. (I thought to ""offer"" but worried she'd hear it like charity, rather than as something I was eager to do.) She relents and passes me her daughter. We play for a few minutes, and as soon as she, I think, felt at ease, she was OUT COLD. Never seen a person so exhausted.

I think this is awesome, and I'm so happy she's getting this rest. The flight attendants are thrilled that I'm helping cuz I'm sure they aren't fans of screaming babies.

Anyhow, she sleeps for three solid hours, and eventually the baby falls asleep in my lap. That's the first time a baby ever slept on me like that. I kind of melted with all the wholesomeness happening around me.

When the ""landing soon"" announcements came on, mamma BLASTED awake from a dead sleep, confused even where she was, and in her semi-dream state, panicked looking for her baby. I put a hand on her shoulder and kind of welcomed her back to reality. As she got her wits about her, a wave of thankful and apology washed over her. She couldn't believe she'd slept, or that her kid was fast asleep on my lap.

I just smiled and told her how much I enjoyed holding the baby and letting her get that sleep.

As we land, she asks where I'm staying and I just say the name of some guesthouse in town. Immediately, she tells me her family will be at the airport to pick her up, and I should get a ride with them. I accept.

When we exit the plane, I walked with her to help her collect her bags. Once we came out thru customs, nearly 20 boisterous Mongolians were standing out there, waiting for her. They ERUPTED with excitement at seeing her. She explains to them who I am, and suddenly I am getting hugs and kisses from everyone in the family. 

Yes. Just, yes. 

We all herd out to the parking area and I piled into the back of an old SUV and sat in the floor with all of her little cousins while they just stared at me with intense curiosity. It was awesome. There were at least four cars in the caravan. 

They dropped me off, and as they drove away, everyone from all the cars rolled down the windows and screamed out to me to have an amazing time on my journey. It was perhaps one of the warmest things I've ever experienced. 😊 ",2018-12-11 02:07:16

People were coming from other parts of the store to save her! 

I had tried to quiet her, but she only got louder. So I tried ignoring her because she was usually able to calm down faster when I did that. It didn't work. 😐 But my other kids needed the milk and other things in my basket so I kept shopping for about 20 more minutes. She continued to scream until I put her in her car seat, even in the checkout line. One minute after I pulled out of the parking spot, she fell asleep....

Silly how we've got to this. 🤷🏻‍♂️ ",2018-12-11 00:30:34
a4x6gx,"100% agree with this. When I flew with my then 4 month old (now almost 18 months 😢) I had a really kind lady sitting next to me who offered to help me with the baby while I got everything settled. She then went above and beyond for me, even put her travel pillow under my arm while I nursed him during take off and got my bag down and helped me get my stuff off the plane. Once she gave that initial offer, it really helped me relax and be willing to accept help. 

General advice for anyone.... Crying babies on planes are annoying, I get it. But try to be kind! It's stressful for parents flying with babies. We don't want to annoy you. But we also have to get places sometimes. This particular trip my mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She was struggling emotionally so I went down to spend a week with her to brighten her spirits. You never know why someone is traveling with a baby. Always try to be kind and understanding.",2018-12-10 20:05:33

SCIENCE FTW.

I've never seen a case of polio, smallpox, mumps, rubella, Hib or diphtheria. I've only seen a handful of measles, whooping cough, pneumococcal meningitis, and tetanus cases.

Know why? Because vaccines $#&#! Work.

I have mentors who tell me stories about losing patients, regularly, to these diseases - diseases, we literally rarely see nowadays thanks to the modern scientific marvel that is vaccines.

*This photo was taken at the March for Science in New York City in 2018. Pre-Covid.

A woman walked up to me and told me a story from her childhood. She told me she remembers classmates dying and or getting severely ill from polio. She remembered coming to school and noticing one of her good friends was no longer in class. It was polio. She then got teary-eyed when she recalled the hope brought by the polio vaccine.

Our generation will one day share that same story of hope. It's happening right now. The covid19 vaccine is safe, effective, and is already saving lives. Real world efficacy data is matching what we saw in trials. We're almost there. ✌🏽🙏🏽

Thank goodness I live in America and can freely defend myself and others with more than just my fists. 
How do terrorists get bombs if they’re illegal too?
If something’s illegal, people will find a way to get it if they want it. 
In America though, we decide to level the playing field and not play victim. They don’t know who’s packing. In Texas we stop an attack then call the police🤣",2019-12-01 05:49:55
e3l7j5,"Bruh if you actually knew how to handle a gun and defend yourself and others, you could potentially drop an assistant before police even arrive. 
How do these terrorists also get knives if they’re illegal though? That’s against the law!!🤭If they wanted a gun they could probably get one too.
Criminals/terrorists want soft targets, weak people, or easy victims.

Thankfully we have a right to defend ourselves in America, the balls to not be a victim, the voice to stand up to our government, and the will to let any country know we don’t tolerate criminals, terrorists, etc and will fight back ourselves if necessary🤙🏼",2019-12-01 05:59:28

He’s fought in WW2 over the beaches of Normandy, the Korean War, and (I think) Vietnam. He retired the position right under general I believe.

8iabih,"I worked at Friday’s for 9 years starting in the early 2000s come to think of it I started March of 2000. 😆 Anyway, the food was still good, but it quickly started to decline. By 2007 most foods were switching over to pre battered frozen crap. The baby backs were coming in precooked that resulted in dry rubbery ribs, and the pecan chicken was coming in prebreaded that was too thick and constantly had complaints. Don’t get me started on the Give me stripes program that replaced the gold points, and the happy hour that lasted all night so if you were bar tending you made tons of drinks and made no money. I switched to only working lunch M-F and made more money than the night BTs. $200-300 at lunch. 9am-5pm. I was killing it, brought too much attention to myself and they started promising the world. I was dumb enough to listen. Took a huge pay cut as an assistant manager, and they had the nerve to ask me to drive 45 minutes further to work at another location...no raise as I was maxed out for my position...and when I asked for a $30wk gas card instead, the DO (who promoted me and promised the world) said no. So I said thanks but no thanks, and left 2 months later. Best choice I ever made. ",2018-05-10 01:34:01

Editing so hopefully I'll stop getting the same comments over and over haha:

1. Yes, everyone knows that you don't actually reserve a seat. I think they were trying to inflate the number that were supposedly going to increase the disappointment when the actual turnout was much less. That's why the overflow stage was built - in expectation of lots of people outside.

2. everyone I saw was using temp emails and Google voice numbers.

3. This has the added effect of costing the campaign and the dozens of campaigns that Trump sells data to money to send spam.

I love to see another black man happy but damned if I didn't wish he could be at home with friends/family. Nobody who's *nonessential* should work Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, or the Day after. 

 Only reason you should be at work is if your job/career is in a life saving field or you work for the government/local government. And even then you should be paid handsomely or receive some form of above adequate compensation.

ro0e5t,"Lol you do realize guys from UPS, Fed Ex and the postal service were out too and not just delivering to houses…delivering medications and vaccines lol Amazon employees get what they deserve because the workers are cool with a $2 raise and shutting their mouths 😂😆😂",2021-12-25 05:36:51
ro0e5t,"For some of us, our customers are our only family

🍻",2021-12-25 05:21:30
ro0e5t,"This. Plus dat holiday pay ✨✨✨

I’m working and don’t mind. I’m an ambulance dispatcher so it’s not like we CAN shut down for the holidays, but I wouldn’t care if it was at Amazon either. They make more anyways. And imagine all the surprised happy faces that weren’t expecting their package that day!",2021-12-25 08:31:15
ro0e5t,Lol you don’t volunteer in the logistics industry…very comical you actually don’t realize someone has to order your last minute stuff and it always 💯 not by choice so just stop lol,2021-12-25 05:38:16
ro0e5t,They do. At least in the warehouse part. And for the whole peak season they gave us double OT pay. Made the 6 day 10 hours a little more bearable. 😅,2021-12-25 04:47:43
ro0e5t,"Definitely feels like the majority of comment threads I stumble across these days are a toxic cesspool, even if the post is meant to be positive. Guess you and I aren't really helping though 😅",2021-12-25 07:28:30
ro0e5t,"How about we earn him some bonus? Anyone know how to setup a go fund me/donation campaign?
Love this dude ❤️",2021-12-25 19:54:36
ro0e5t,Lol you adding the feeding tube thing to make me feel a certain way is comical at best…no sympathy from me bud I’ve had 3 fights with cancer..anyway back to original post…Amazon drivers have voted many union contracts to be able to demand fair pay and better hours..they don’t…I have been delivering for UPS for 20 years and missed a lot more Xmas eve then this guy…I don’t feel sympathy for someone who put themselves in stupid spots sorry just not a overly sensitive person like some 😂 Amazon and their workers failed the labor industry for a couple dolllar more EVERYTIME…#teamsters,2021-12-25 05:53:29
ro0e5t,"If ""Santa"" came to our door, I would get my kids to see him. And because this was so special, and made the kids happy and excited, I would tip the guy $5. It's Christmas, man. And a Merry Christmas to you sir. 🎅🎄🦌⛄🎁",2021-12-25 12:09:31
ro0e5t,"The US will never sign labour laws that protect the workforce! Presidential campaigns are funded by owners of big businesses. 
It’s exactly the same reason that in spite of a new school shooting occurring every week, any nut job can still pop into Walmart and buy a gun. No president will ban the sale of firearms. The NRA pour far too much money into political campaigns. 
Democracy in action! 🤣",2021-12-25 11:00:02
ro0e5t,"The only thing heartwarming about this picture is the gentleman in it, the context behind it fucking sucks and if Amazon was a better company their drivers wouldn't be delivering Christmas presents at 6pm on Christmas Eve. 
This man went into work that morning and probably didn't get off until 8-9 that night. 

What bullshit are you talking about? Literally explain, you just a name calling troll whose pissed he didn't receive any presents.

Leave me alone, I'm bout to smoke some fire weed and go see my family. 😂✌🏽",2021-12-25 15:49:18

fxy16o,"I took my dog from an old co-worker, I guess friend at the time. His a little chihuahua, was used as a stud for breeding. He got pushed around by their Bulldogs and pits and when he stood up for himself he was beat by the old owner.

I was over there and saw this and called him out, lil man ran over to me for protection. The owner and his wife told me I was the only person that their dickhead dog ever went near and I should take him.

So I did. About 5 minutes later I was out the door and carried him home in my coat (it was winter, didn't drive at the time). 

Well that little dude latched on to me like no tomorrow. He won't ever leave my side now when I get home. Love him. Previous owners were right though, he is kind of a dick and he really doesn't like anyone except me. Just like his new Papa 😍",2020-04-09 21:30:18

fxy16o,"Love these stories! 🥺
A couple years back, I saw one of my neighbors with her daughter and the cutest little puppy just running around. Then months later I noticed whenever they’d leave their patio door open (this was an apt complex ) I saw the dog in a tiny cage by the door. I didn’t think much of it until I’d pass by and thought it looked unmoved. And then I remember during a week of particularly bad weather the cage ended up outside with the dog in there no matter what time I walked by. I wanted to kid nap her but I figured she probably would give her away to me if I asked. And she did. She confessed she forgot about her. When she got out of the cage she ran to the empty bag of dog food by the door. I took her up to my place and noticed how scrawny she was, and her fur was matted with dog poop. I just started crying. I couldn’t keep her cause  I had two dogs at the time and that was the limit in the apartment complex. But I took care of her while researching rescues that could help. she had the best personality! Would rarely bark, very energetic and easily potty trained. She bounced back so quickly, and the rescue told me she got adopted by an older couple with a backyard. Like I said, this was years ago but I still think of her, and hope to be Able to foster/ rescue animals later on.",2020-04-09 23:05:34
fxy16o,"Thank fucking god you did.

You are a real everyday life Champion!

I hope many people read this and are inspired to be as brave & ❤ caring as you, and step up and do the same thing.

I wish I was a millionaire and could secretly reward you, but all I can send are fond wishes and hope everything you desire in your life comes to you easily and with grace.

My family was friends with the owner and offered to take him and they said yes. I loved that dog so much, we named him Scrappy. That was my first dog and he was our best friend.. I’ll never forget the day he got lost in a rainstorm, my sisters and I cried our eyes out all day. But he found his way home to us.. just thinking about him now had me alil sad but so happy.

Why do you believe this?  Point me to ***ONE*** published, peer-reviewed paper that indicates this is correct and true.  Just one.

>How hard is it to understand that you shouldn’t bring the virus home?

Again (for the cheap seats), since the mask isn't protecting you from the virus ... how is it preventing you from bringing it home, Fraulein?

>Is it that hard to understand?

It should not be, but it really seems to be beyond your comprehension.  Did you do well in school?

>And who tf told you that healthy people could not spread the virus??? 🤣

I never suggested that.  I said that asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission rates were low.  However, that isn't the point of our discussion.  Stay focused, please.

>It is deadly, ask the 120.000 people who died only in US.

It is difficult to ask dead people anything.  There is also a significant discrepancy in the U.S. about how many people died with the virus, versus how many people died *from* the virus.  However, if you are struggling with the first logic question, there is absolutely no feasible way that you are ready for deeper levels of thought.

>Of course it’s deadly

Your telescreen is definitely telling you as much.

>how stupid and ignorant are you?

Less so than you.

>I’d be surprised if your IQ is above room temperature mate

I'm sure that your life is a series of random surprises that are blatantly obvious to the rest of us.  At least it's blissful.

>And why am I protecting strangers?  Humanity I guess?

Still missing the point.  IF ... YOU ... ARE ... PROTECTING ... ""STRANGERS"" ... WHEN ... YOU ... ARE ... OUTSIDE, ... WHAT ... ARE ... YOU ... DOING ... WHEN ... YOU ... GET ... HOME?

>I’m not a fucking idiot?

Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

uz1u5c,"GUN RESPONSIBILITY LEADS TO GUN SAFETY  
A Common-Sense Approach to Second Amendment Issues.  ©  
With the increasing massacres, gun-related deaths, and heartbreaking reports of children with guns, (up to 8 child incidents per day in the US), almost everyone can agree there are too many guns in our society. The death toll is rising along with the number of guns. Mindful of the Las Vegas Massacre in which almost 1,200 rounds were fired, mostly into the crowd, by a single shooter in a very few minutes, it’s time to fully grasp that guns are primarily designed to kill or maim people and animals. Since their basic nature is lethal, society is fully justified in requiring firearm protections to ensure public safety.   
There is no need or justification to repeal the 2nd Amendment enshrined in our Constitution, it was put there to safeguard freedoms… and freedom’s obligations. The way to address 2nd Amendment issues is to legislate responsible, well-regulated gun ownership as the 2nd Amendment clearly states.   
1.	  Responsibility of Gun Ownership  
As a deadly weapon, every gun must have an owner who is legally responsible for it.  
An unregistered gun is a threat to civilized society because no one is legally responsible. Guns are dangerous. If no one is willing to accept the responsibility for a gun, it should be destroyed.   
  
2.	 Licensing, Registration, and Background Checks  
Every gun and its owner must be Licensed and Registered and all gun owners must pass a Background Check.  
This is how society can identify and regulate who is responsible for a gun. Society mandates the same three basic requirements for motor vehicles, despite their primary purpose being simply transportation.   
  
3.	Insure All Firearms  
If you drive a car, you are expected to have liability insurance. It is your responsibility.  
Like driving, gun responsibility requires gun owners’ insurance so that victims or anyone else involved can be suitably compensated. Society must not bear the predictable costs when individuals claim gun ownership rights without accepting gun ownership responsibilities.   
Who currently pays to clean up a murder, suicide, or mass shooting? Incredibly, these costs are paid by taxpayers and victims.  
  
4.	The gun owner is liable for their gun   
No matter what happens with a gun, if the registered owner fails to secure it, the owner is both responsible and liable.  
Guns don’t kill people, they are just efficient tools. People kill people. Guns cannot be held liable, therefore ‘accidents’ cannot be blamed on guns as they often are now. Gun responsibility requires guns to be kept securely, so they can’t fall into the wrong hands.    
As a deadly weapon, guns cannot be ‘accidentally’ pointed at anyone. If anyone is wounded or killed by a gun being cleaned, handled, or dropped, the gun owner is responsible and liable.     
Killing unnecessarily is horrible. The shooting of a child, or by a child, is the worst crime imaginable and must be treated as such. If a child has access to a gun, the gun owner is liable for what happens next. If a child or anyone else is ‘accidentally’ killed or wounded, the gun owner must, at a minimum, be charged with some degree of Murder. If a child has access to a gun, the crime is recognized by law as depraved indifference to the consequences of not securing the gun, and the gun owner is charged accordingly. Any of the above crimes cannot legally be the fault of a child or a gun. Accidental discharge cannot be considered a defense.  
  
  
  
5.	Do Not Threaten Your Neighbor With a Firearm      
Civilian concealed carry is sometimes necessary for self-defense, but a concealed gun does not imply a threat to anyone unless openly displayed.   
Public, civilian open-carry (in a non-hunting or target practice setting) is an implicit threat to your neighbor, a bully’s intimidation tactic. Open-carry put in basic terms demands (from another point of view); ‘Do not mess with me, I have granted myself Police powers. I am fully prepared to shoot you at any time, and for any reason, I think applies.’ Proponents may call it self-defense, or exercising their rights, but from another point of view, it is an assumed claim to possibly be your Judge, Jury, and Executioner.  
Openly carried firearms have no place at Government Offices, public establishments, or at protests on our streets where they increase tensions, constitute an extra-judicial mob, invite law-enforcement reprisals, and intensify police militarization.   
  
6.	  Live by the Gun, Possibly Die by the Gun  
Stand your ground laws are a legal path to anarchy, because, from either end of the gun, you can legally be the next victim.   
‘Stand Your Ground’ laws say you only have to feel threatened to defend yourself, anywhere, at any time. Since it is often problematic to tell a good guy with a gun from a bad guy with a gun, anyone has the right under these laws, to feel threatened by civilian, open-carry. As a result, the threatened have the legal right to defend themselves. Like the Wild West, the problem turns into who shot first and why? The logic of these laws is indefensible.  
  
7.	Rapid-Firing, Multi-cartridge Weapons Are Weapons of Mass Destruction    
As a practical definition, any weapon that can kill many people quickly and easily (or silently) is a Weapon of Mass Destruction.   
Do the dead know any difference between a Bomb, a Chemical Weapon, or a Rapid-Fire, Multi-Cartridge Firearm? There is no responsible justification for civilians to own these weapons unless killing all your neighbors is considered self-defense. These are Weapons of War and Terrorism and otherwise have no practical use to society. We spend huge sums worldwide on our military to protect us from these weapons… just not on our streets.   
Our Police, First Responders, and the Military are skilled public servants and deserve our support. Their lives are on the front line in the course of their duties. We should not ask them to face weapons of mass destruction, on duty or off. If you think clearly about it, no one on the streets of America, should. Own them legally or not, keep them responsibly, don’t parade them in the streets, unless you are prepared to surrender them.  
  
8.	Militias Are Only Legal When Called Forth  
Although militias are mentioned in the Second Amendment, It is settled law that they can legally exist only if, and when, called forth by a Governor or President. Militias are private armies and require responsible control. Unlike an Army with transparent command and control structures with civilian oversight, a militia is an armed mob, a form of terrorist cell, responsible only to themselves, and potentially hazardous to everyone else. A peaceful society cannot tolerate guerilla forces in their midst, and certainly not armed, private militaries parading in our streets or practicing for the overthrow of our government.      
  
Finally, let’s take a moment to send our thoughts and prayers for our brave American children who give up their lives to protect our current, almost entirely unregulated, 2nd Amendment right to bear arms.",2022-05-27 22:25:23

uz1u5c,I find those thin blue bumper stickers and here in AZ license plates to be very cringy. Because it truly has no meaning when people started using them in support of cops when they were the ones in the wrong. See us beat up a man unprovoked…thin blue. Know for fact a gunman is in the school…thin blue. See us kneel on a mans neck for minutes…thin blue.  I just don’t know how you can support them when they do shit like that. So those thin blue merch i find extremely corny and its 🤡 behavior. I’m sure they’ll use this to justify giving them an even bigger budget than they already have. This one is hilarious.,2022-05-28 05:17:35

I remember when I got that news about my mom when I was in high school.
Bro. I already lost my dad to cancer, and the treatment on my mom made her a zombie and I was just a boy.
I thought I’d have no parents left before I graduated.

I know the feeling when you get that news, and I am *so god damned happy for you*.

Give her all the love, it’s a hard thing for you both to go through.
Remind her she’s amazing and strong and help her get back on her feet.

You’re amazing and strong too.
Be amazing and strong for her, as I’m sure you have been.

Such wonderful news!! My cousin is going through chemo and I'm hoping he gets the same result.  4 family members on 1 side of my family are all battling that shit. My uncle,  his son, his daughter (double mastectomy) and my other cousin have all been diagnosed with cancer in the past 3yrs. It's been crazy. One devastating diagnosis after another. Then their grandfather (my godfather) falls and breaks his hip at 98yrs old. 6 months after his wife died. This side of my family spends Thanksgiving together every year, for at least the past 60yrs. My dad, is terminally ill with Pulmonary Fibrosis and a host of other issues. My godfather is in a rehab center this year. So we are all meeting there to spend it together. Cant miss out on tradition. Unfortunately my dad, is too I'll to even leave the house. 
I've been out of state for the past 15yrs. This Thanksgiving is going to mean more than any other, ever. 
Congrats to your mom and your family!!

Constantly put down other people, dropped out of college because he was “so smart, smarter than his professors” and reminded me on a regular basis how, when in middle school, he ranked in the top 99th percentile of some test and had psychologists wanting to speak with him “because he was so smart” but his mom denied them because “it would go straight to his head”, which even the thought of it clearly did. Constantly quit jobs, went months without getting another one, seriously one of the most irresponsible and immature people ever. God forbid you disagree with something he says and he would go ape shit. But if he disagreed with what I said I had to get yelled at until I cried, then yelled at more for “being weak and crying” because *I* was “unable to take criticism,”.
   
     
     
I don’t know about the rest of your relationship, but just based on this one comment that’s a serious red flag, and if anything I said in the above statement connected with you, I really want you to know that you don’t deserve it. My ex swore that I would never *ever* find anyone as “good” as him.... and literally a month later I became acquainted with an awesome guy who finished college, and actually has life skills, super humble, and quite literally is the person of all of my hopes and dreams of a SO personified into one being without even knowing that was what I wanted... he just is like that all on his own and I cherish it and tell him that I appreciate him *all the time*; he does the same to me and I wish I could go back in time and call it quits sooner before I wasted 4 years of my life on someone who had no remote idea of how to survive in this world, and constantly put others down to inflate his own ego.

ja4o58,"Here is my story again guys I had my scan linked to the bottom so the mods removed it but I can repost my story and figure out a way to block out my personal info


I am a 29 Year old (F) who just had a brain aneurysm last week and am still in the hospital

This is my story. I just had a brain aneurysm rupture a little over a week ago and almost didn’t make it. I’m a 29 year old semi healthy woman who until that moment had lived a pretty stressful life with little to no time to slow down and relax. Single mom of a 2 year old and a manager of a retail store in a national chain leaves almost Zero time to take for myself. Everything changed that day 10/01/2020 I remember being at work and feeling a sharp piercing pain shooting up my neck and head and this feeling of dread like I just felt I was gonna die. My boss drove me to urgent care and they basically did nothing and said I had a migraine and to go home. I went home and took a nap which was very dangerous to do but I didn’t know how serious the condition was.. and I ended up calling 9-11 and going to the hospital and they found out pretty quickly that I had a Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in my brain and that an aneurysm had ruptured and I would need surgery ASAP and I felt like I was given a death sentence and couldn’t even comprehend anything else they said. Within moments I was signing a proxy and asked about DNR and having a priest pray by my side I had never been so scared in my life. I didn’t even have time to say goodbye to my toddler I remember praying to god that if he saved me I would change my life around. And then I came out of it.. I remembered my
Name I knew who the president was and the year and I could squeeze there hand and react appropriately and the doctors looked amazed. They said I was part of the .07 percent that survive an aneurysm and come out with little to no neurological deficits. I am truly lucky to be alive it is going to be a long road though ahead I have to be here a few more weeks and am in severe pain and headaches from all the blood in my
Head but I can get through this with enough love and support so please keep me in your prayers!!! 🙏

ja4o58,"I wish you the best!!! 💖✌

I had brain surgery and remember (one of the few memories I was able to hold on to at the time) sitting in a hospital bed with the word STROKE written in big red letters on a whiteboard in front of me.  At that time, I had no idea I had even went in for brain surgery or why I'm in a hospital or where I'm at or what.  I couldn't hold on to memories well.  I could barely walk on my own.  And things felt dreamy because I teleported from one place to another (I was actually being moved from a hospital to an actual house I share with other patients where they help those with TBI recover, but I had a hard time holding on to memories).

At some point I became lucid enough to realize what happened.  I had surgery, things went awry, and now I am relegated to being a vegetable the rest of my life because I had some strokes.  I wasn't going to hang around for that.  I got out my phone to look up a way to take my life and I happened to find a picture of me I saved on the Golden Gate Bridge.  I live nowhere near SF but I suddenly remembered why I was there.  After my \~12th \[fruitless\] emergency room visit at 3AM and realizing no one can figure out this worsening permanent insomnia-driven painful neurological hell I could never escape from,  I drove overnight for 10 hours to take my life there.

While I was walking along that bridge waiting for the many pain pills (Soma) and the Xanax I had just took to kick-in (those meds were prescribed to me to help me cope with the hell I was in, and now I was using them to numb me up enough to escape from that very same hell—by jumping off this bridge), it suddenly occurred to me that if I am going to go out, I might as well go out trying.  None of the 15+ doctors I had seen at that point thought this cyst in the center of my brain was responsible.  But I thought it was, so I said ""fuck it.  I'm taking matters into my own hands, goddammit.  I'll email a brain surgeon myself, if I have to.  And if that surgery kills me, I wanted to die anyways.  And if that fails to cure me, I'll come back here one year from now and I will feel justified in taking my life here.""

And that's what I did.  I literally emailed a brain surgeon.  His office actually responded.  He summoned me up to check me out, have other doctors run studies and check me out, and eventually he actually agreed to do the surgery.

...so it suddenly occurred to me then that I had 4 more months until that anniversary of me being on that bridge, and that was the promise I kept to myself—to try everything at wait until that time next year to take my life if that's what I still wanted to do.

It's a good thing I waited.  I'd get discharged from that place, have my first follow up with my brain surgeon, realize \[from him\] that ""there were strokes"" and those were instead bruises caused from the endoscope that would \[and did\] heal,  and that I would make a full recovery.

And I did indeed end up making a full recovery and got back a life I thought I had lost because of that cyst in the center of my brain.

I ended up emailing that brain surgeon later on, thanking him.  In that email, I sent him a picture of me on that bridge—minutes away from taking my life, saying that this was the hell I was in before that brain surgery he did.  And I also sent him a picture of me on the one year anniversary of my brain surgery.  Instead of jumping off that bridge, I literally jumped head-first out of a plane 2 miles in the sky.  I went skydiving on the one year anniversary of my brain surgery.  I told him that, because of him, I went from jumping off a bridge to jumping out of a plane.

TL;DR:  I 'woke up' in a hospital in a confused vegetative state and was told I had strokes after having brain surgery.  Turned out all the doctors (except the brain surgeon) were wrong, I'd fully recover and get a life I thought I'd never get back again.  But I almost took my life in the interim, thinking I would spend decades as a vegetable—and was glad I didn't take my life, then, because I would fully recover.  And my story is out there (somewhere), and I apparently helped others who suffered the same shit I had.

Anyways, I wish you the best!  Hang in there!",2020-10-13 05:34:05
ja4o58,"Neuro ICU nurse at a Comprehensive Stroke Center. I've taken care of thousands of aneurysmal SAH (subarachnoid hemorrhage) patients. Congrats on getting through the initial insult of the aneurysm rupture, most people don't survive that. But please know that this is far from over. I am sure they've talked to you about this, but aneurysmal SAH patients tend to have ""vasospasm"" of surrounding vessels that peaks 7-10 days after the initial insult. This is caused by the blood irritating the vessels to the point that they ""clamp down"" and can cause neurological deficits. the grade of SAH usually correlates with how hard you spasm (Grades 3-4 usually spasm the most, grade 5s usually die). There are things that your medical team is doing to prevent the spasm, and there are interventions that can be done if you spasm so much that it causes neurological deficits.

I feel for you girl. Stay strong. You are young, which is awesome, because the youngest are the most resilient.  Also be prepared for excruciating headaches and back pain. It will pass but it is a bitch. Sending good vibes your way. 💜",2020-10-13 16:56:20

ja4o58,That’s half the battle! My grandma had this exact thing happen when she was in her late 40’s and lived to be almost 90. You got this 👍,2020-10-13 04:23:50
ja4o58,"First I have to say, please try your best to ignore some of the hateful comments I’ve seen strewn about in the comments section. You don’t deserve that. I am one whom *does* like hearing positive stories or stories of people overcoming incredible odds, and as someone who already knew the survivability of this type of event, well, it does bring me joy for you to know you’re ok. 

I don’t have any aneurysms (that I know of and do fear), but when you said you had this “feeling of dread”, I’ve actually had that sensation before and I could never convince anyone just what that feels like, and it’s terrifying on its own. I’ve never been able to shake that from my memory, but I am just going to keep living my life until I’m no longer around. 

I know it may be weird to see/hear, but I say hug your friends and hug your family (with consent of course) any time you can because one day you won’t get another chance to. 

Hang in there 😊",2020-10-13 04:27:30

ja4o58,"My grandmother survived a brain aneurysm and lived too! They lived across the street from a fire station and my grandpa ran over immediately when my she collapsed. She had to relearn to do everything, but made it to live into her late 80’s and died peacefully in her sleep. Her memory after wasn’t very good and she had post it’s all over the house reminding her of simple things, but she remembered most things that happened before the aneurysm. She was a tough, lovely bird ❤️ I’m so glad you’re ok! My aunt died in her sleep from one as well so I’m pretty much expecting one anytime...",2020-10-13 04:47:40

I know you understand that right now, but after a while, that feeling tends to fade. You just have to remember to constantly remind yourself of what you went through and survived! I say that from a place of experience, love, and admiration!🤗 I'm 4 years out of surviving a gunshot wound to the Head, so I understand surviving the unsurvivable! I didn't read all the nonsense comments, but don't let them get to you. I've gotten picked on for being disabled due to my injury. I used to let it get to me but now I just feel sorry for them.
My reply to people like that, is, ""hey, it could be worse for me, I could be a sad sorry individual like you. ""Keep on keeping on OP. Stay strong, and stay focused on life!",2020-10-13 10:22:30
ja4o58,"My mother went through that as well, she had aneurysm rupture on her right side of the brain and survived. She was unlucky tho, that happend on a Saturday after her work, she came home went to bed with a headache, we didn't know at the time and didn't bother her, when I tried to wake her up, around 8-9 pm she wasn't responding, she was already in a coma. She was transported to a hospital in other city cause our didn't have what was needed to operate immediately. As our health care sistem works perfectly in Serbia (I said that ironically) she had her operation on Monday morning. She was in intensive care for some time I can't remember exactly but she woke up.
She did survive but she didn't recover completely. Hers left side of her body is paralised, not 100% but let's say 95%. She did learn to live and is still with ous.
I wish you the best in recovery and rest of your life! 🙏",2020-10-13 10:42:59

My brother, at 35, had an aneurysm. His vertebral artery burst and neurosurgeon had to reconstruct it. We are extremely lucky he survived and is doing so well. He gets headaches from time to time but  his character, his speech and mobility are intact. He's different, though. There's a serenity about him that wasn't there before.

1. Kind of. We have Henrique Capriles, who is probably the main player, Henry Ramos Allup, Julio Borges, among others. The problem is that a lot of people from the opposition are angry with them for doing nothing and letting the protests die after Leopoldo López, another opposition leader, was jailed in 2014. Still, I do believe that if we manage to achieve something, the fear that Maduro's party will gain back power will be enough to make everyone support whichever leader steps up, probably Henrique Capriles. I believe this because that's happened several times since the MUD (a coalition of every political party from the opposition) was formed. This is how we got a majority of the seats in the National Assembly.  
2. They didn't when they started this time, but I have seen a huge amount of people tweeting about April 19th's coup d'état, so I'd say that's the aim right now. Still, it's not as well organized as it should be.  
3. In a way, yes. Not taking into account the people that got rich (or richer) due to the corruption in the government, almost all of the Venezuelan ""high society"" is part of the opposition. This includes Lorenzo Mendoza, the owner of Polar, which is probably the biggest food distributer in Venezuela. They are known for keeping up production of the products they consider essential, even at a loss, when the government won't give them foreign currency or regulates prices to even lower than the production costs.  

Even with all of this, our economy is so utterly destroyed that it's probably not enough to prevent a period of anarchy and chaos when shit goes down. But hey, how much lower can we sink? 🙂   

Take everything with a grain of salt since this is all from my personal point of view, hope it helped!",2017-04-19 20:24:18

My kid was clearly terrified but also intrigued and started talking to the guy. My child... he asked the most prying and weird questions.

my8gje,"I assume he means short of money/didn’t own a suit. ETA it could also be a translation issue because one of the definitions of “shortcoming” is “lacking”. ETA #2 - could also be a regional usage. I find those types variations are really interesting. ETA #3 - why am I so obsessed with this detail of word usage? Nothing like a random Sunday morning attack of the ADHD hyperfocus 🙃

Edit (wow that *is* easier to type): I understand not everyone uses the acronym ETA for the phrase “edited to add” and did not mean to start a debate on the topic. I haven’t started referring to my husband as my “DH” so maybe there is still hope for me. I think OP looks fantastic in his suit.",2021-04-25 14:59:15

llamqi,"Oh hey me, it's you!

Seriously though, I'm reaching the end of my ""safe"" window for getting pregnant, and I think about this almost daily. 

If I don't have a kid, I might miss out on the greatest thing you can do with your life.

If I do, any number of terrible things can happen, up to and including my own death.

I know it's not something to take lightly but I often think I'm just never going to be sure. I envy people who get pregnant and are just like 🤷",2021-02-17 13:51:59

llamqi,"Well I can see two lives ahead of me. One where I have kids and am happy but miss having freedom and independence. And I can see myself being childfree and staying a dog goat and chicken mom and being happy but feeling like I’m missing out on the joy of children. I think in both futures I will be happy, but have regrets. 🤷🏻‍♀️",2021-02-16 23:55:33
llamqi,"I've been told if you're in average health then the window starts to close around 36, but that just means the likelihood of complications and birth defects starts to go up, and it may become increasingly difficult to conceive. I believe 36 is when you are considered a ""geriatric"" pregnancy due to these potential problems. 

However, I know it also varies A LOT. I have a friend who was on the less healthy side of average. Her first pregnancy was at 20 and it was perfectly normal. Her second was at 31 and she had many, many complications. She now has chronic pain and permanent damage to her abdominal muscles and back.

I have another friend who's on the healthier side of average. She got pregnant accidentally (she thought she was pre-menopausal) at age 44. Her pregnancy was totally normal, no complications, healthy baby.

I think the hardest part for me is all the unknowns, especially those about my body and whether it can handle being pregnant. Like, I'm terrified of my abdominal muscles separating, because it means a lifetime of pain. But I have also gone up and down in weight drastically and quickly at multiple points in my life, and never had a problem, so does that mean it's less likely to happen to me? I asked my gynecologist (who is also an OB) and she was like 🤷

I have similar worries with tearing and dental problems.

And that doesn't even begin to cover the other things I worry about. Like, is it selfish to bring a child into a world with so many big, systemic problems? How much money should we have in savings? We're broke millennials, what if we don't ever have much of a savings? Do we just not get to have a kid? What if my depression gets bad again? I'm prone to fluctuations and don't respond to meds. How is my partner's anxiety going to be with a kid? What about our sex life? We're both kinky so it's not really as simple as waiting until the kid is in bed...

I don't know. I really do want a kid. Just one. I want to experience being pregnant. I think I'd be a great parent. But I'm terrified of running into a huge problem or permanently damaging my body. I worry that if that happens I will resent my decision and my mental health will take a nose dive...

I'm just rambling now. I'm also 34, and we want to make a decision soon, so it's been on my mind *a lot.*",2021-02-17 21:09:34

jgv8tg,"All of these wonderful positive stories make me so happy to read, I had a friend a few years ago go into heart surgery and unfortunately he had to be put into a coma for a month afterwards because things went very very wrong during surgery.

When he finally came out, he only got to have three beautiful days with friends with family before he past away because his heart just couldn’t do it. He had a very specific and unfortunate condition. So it’s definitely not the “norm” 
But it’s definitely tainted my outlook to heart surgery.
I was really uplifted reading many of these comments.

I absolutely hate this part.  But with my 3rd one... I started sneezing through my mouth.  I can’t explain it. And I can only do it when I’m recovering from surgery 😂😂😂😂

I’m on the transplant list now for a heart & both lungs ... I’ll be the 1st one ever with Northwestern & Lurie Childrens in Chicago... 

The hope is to just use the previous sternotomies I’ve had in the past... but they might also have to a clamp shell thoracotomy cut.  

I’ve been on the list since sept.  I’m knitting up a few Christmas gifts in case we get the call ... but if I’m done with them... I wanna knit my own heart and lung pillows for after my transplant!",2020-10-24 03:34:24

kr10tx,"I looked at just a handful of replies, most just commented on who the guy looked liked. My first thought, however, was - I totally agree with him. I cannot, for the life of me, understand where McConnell is coming from, (I almost wrote, where is his head at? However, the answer came to me no sooner than the 1st question was thought.) I have avoided reading anything about his repeated rejection of the Stimulus bill #2 amt. It just totally escapes me that we, the Citizens of this country, who have paid our taxes faithfully every year in order run the country, are now in desperate need & those
Individual's we believed would do their best to watch out for our best interests, are falling real  short of their duty to us.  Have these 'officials lost touch with how we, the regular citizens, actually live? Do they not know the what cost is just to keep their family with shelter, clothing, food, utilities? And those are just bare, basic needs, And to see & hear how the same 'officials' argue & bicker over giving back   some of our own money? I think it's time to start cleaning house, spring cleaning is what many people do every spring, and it's a through, down to the places that are ignored most of the prior year. Nancy Pelosi, we've come to realize is a power hungry old woman who has become so power hungry & takes her position to get whatever she wants. She has become so hate-obsessed against 1 person that she will has put us into such a position that she has lost touch with what her duties as Speaker means. She uses money as a way to get her way. Our Founding Fathers fell on this one position I believe. No one person should ever have the type of power that Speaker of the House has. Wish I could think of even a partial or tiny bit of a solution, but I sure don't. And, another big problem we have is that being in Public Service was never meant to make anyone rich. Truth is that all most every Democrat elected to office came into straight from college without any previous experience working in the private sector whereas most Republicans had previous jobs working in businesses or running one. Dems really lack knowledge of the real world, and at one time claimed they were totally for the working people, supporting them & making sure they would get a fair share in life. Biggest pile off 🐂 💩 ever dumped on us. With the U.S. economy in generally great shape, more times than not. We call ourselves the most powerful & richest country in the would & we even give A LOT of support to other countries, both monetarily as well as militarily. It benefits those other countries as well us. We even give lots money  other support to the likes of Iran, yet I doubt they'll ever be able nor want to help us out at all. And yet, with all that we do & have, our country should never have an educational system that we have & have had for decades now. The majority of these  schools, are found in mainly inner-city, ghettos), so poorly run that they have old out-dated textbooks probably discarded by other schools when they got new ones. These students attend schools in substandard buildings, many with serious structual as well as electrial issues, unreliable heating systems that don't wory many times in winter. Think Chicago, middle of winter & heating system isn't working & it has snowed for 3 straight days, students try to stay warm in an aged brick building & you are told maintenance can't get your school until 2 days from now - that's Friday! Then wonder why the students are performing so poorly & teachers so brand new the ink wasn't even dry on their credential's when they started. I've read of new, excited to start teaching kids, are sent to these ghetto schools as part of the contract they signed when applying for Student Aid. I've read their stories & their attempt to teach kids who didn't even be there, even those that want to learn when stuck in a building that's quickly becoming a giant walk in freezer. Most of the students don't even own a winter coat & their stomachs are probably empty, so they don't have the fuel to create heat within their bodies. Would you want to be one of them?  And that is just a very small picture of what so many of our youth's lives are like, day in & day out. And most homes are 1 parent homes, usually the mother is the only parent living there. Back when Democrats realized there were hundreds of untaped votes in these ghettos they started giving perks & empty promises to the Black communities. This one is totally shameful - they started telling Black women they didn't need to have a man in the house. That if they became pregnant Social Services would increase their benefits. More money? Now society has created a whole generation of single women with 3,4, 6 kids who all have different daddies & last names, still living in ghettos. No ones in the government has even improved where they live, teenage girls get pregnant at 14 on up, then they get their own money from the government. But wait...where does the g'ment get the money? Most young ones don't have a clue that people who work pay taxes to the g'ment to give to those who don't pay taxes. So, to McConnell & all the others, now there's a huge crisis & most people aren't allowed to work, or their business can't open, YOU tight fisted M.F.er's",2021-01-06 12:45:32

We was fighting over a bag of malteasers which we’d brought from within the cinema and I ripped the bag trying to snatch them from him. Our squabbling turned to laughter as we watched rows of people in front of us looking down at their shoes as the malteasers all fell out on the floor and rolled down the ramp which housed all the middle rows of chairs for the movie. Annoyingly we wasted a whole pack and I’m not talking the snack size ones it’s the resealable bags you can buy 💀💀💀. Avatar for me is more memorable because of that lol,2022-12-16 14:03:31

Not cool guys. Not cool.

Remember what you said about walls?

We still hope you guys get better tho. 

No one wishes what we see you going through right now on their allies!

Not a single Canadian, even if it was just for their own self interest wishes on America an UTTERLY SHITFUCKED, badly-handled covid19 pandemic ALONG WITH a certifiably sheisty, corrupt, dickheaded, selfish, narcissistic, unprepared, unintelligent, hypocritical president AND AN IRREVOCABLY & downright idiotic, stuck-in-the-stone-age “winning/majority party” (aka the GOP/Republicans) ON TOP OF one of the most MASSIVE misinformation campaigns ever undertaken by executive leadership when it comes to policy, medical care, the environment, foreign policy, immigration, and basic medical information as agreed upon by the entirety of respected academia (vaccines are good, the earth is round, wear a mask you idiot, don’t inject yourself with any household cleaners after trump goes on a nightly ramble).

We don’t wish it on you, cause it’s all COUPLED WITH the most terribly mis-spent budget, considering he said he was going to “cut taxes and increase jobs”. His “*tax cuts and jobs act*” did the exact OPPOSITE! 

It provided tax cuts ONLY TO THE RICH. See the cuts Jared Kushner we got as a result! He literally fumbled the main rule of presidencies; 

*U CANNOT PROFIT FROM ur OWN RULE; ITS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST*

Now we could go in depth...But we don’t have to! 

We can just stick to simple shit we don’t need anyone’s help to prove! How about how everyone has to stay in trump hotels despite it being more Expensive! I mean .....Sure he offered reductions on the rooms due to the sheer # required for every police conference, every government meeting, every senator travelling with their bodyguards and PR people.... sure he stayed in them himself which is probably actually a step DOWN for him compared to where he normally stays! 

But he made *an ABSOLUTE FUCKING KILLING* on those hotel bills. Look them up. Some small get togethers run up tabs in the millions cause room Service and all other services like laundry same-day servicing and limos are all included as part of the hotel bill. A police officer flew in 10 hours and wants some fucking peanuts and water? That’s 20$ right there. Never mind the gathering of the ENTIRE MILITARY PERSONNEL. 

Not to mention the FBI, cops and trumps *ENORMOUS FAMILY AND THEIR PRIVATE STAFF INCLUDING MAKEUP ARTISTS, HAIR AND CLOTHING STYLISTS, and all other unnecessary shit they drag along with them,* as if they were the kardashians. They kind of *are the kardashians* except they *spend more*. 


The Donald fumbled *so hard* during his 3 year presidential track record that clearly demonstrates the least knowledgeable trump-chosen government-job-holders (due to his strong emphasis on loyalty over competence) and the worst financial crisis the USA has ever seen, along with the destruction of basic intelligent policy and preparedness (less who funding, scrapping helpful environmental policies, tossing out plans for pandemics, natural disasters, wars, plans for economic losses by the middle class, Medicaid/Obamacare, and a literal wealth of other intelligently made policy that requires expensive stockpiles of equipment and personnel to be on-call in case any of the aforementioned things happen!!)

People who voted for him literally don’t understand that Obama care IS THEIR MEDICAID. They will NOT GET THEIR INSULIN. They won’t get cancer treatment. They won’t get that heart operation nor their BP meds! It’s a TRAVESTY!

They voted NO OBAMACARE without realizing that it’s just medical financial help with Obama’s name on it. 

They voted no because they thought he had a PLAN TO REPLACE OBAMACARE. It’s absolutely clear he doesn’t. He shit his pants when it came to the moment to destroy Obamacare. Why? He had NOTHING ELSE TO OFFER. God help his voters.

Please for the LOVE OF ALL THATS HOLY, 

*vote ANYONE BUT TRUMP, if there are only Two options.*

If there are *MORE OPTIONS* please:

*READ ABOUT THE POLITICAL PLATFORMS AND THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM!!*

Know what the political “right” and “left” are. What they stand for, and how they affect you. Talk to people who know about politics about this. Read ONLY
REPUTABLE SOURCES!  

*That means NO MEMES!! NO FACEBOOK!! NO TWITTER!!*

*NO LISTENING TO ONLY ONE PERSON OR EVEN YOUR ENTIRE FRIEND GROUP BC:*

they TEND TO BE *BIASED AF!!*

Finally DO NOT READ ONLY ONE NEWSPAPER

READ POLITICAL SCIENCE FROM PAPERS ON GOOGLE SCHOLAR!!!!!

READ ONLY WHAT ACADEMICS ALL AGREE ON!!!

FORM YOUR OWN OPINION! Ask lots of questions!! Be smart and stand up for your right to vote

Learn how your voting system works. Figure out Why a single persons vote in one state doesn’t mean as much as a single persons vote in another state!! 

*try to talk to your government about making every vote count the SAME as everyone else’s!*

*WHY CAN YOUR PRESIDENTS WIN THE ELECTION WITHOUT THE MAJORITY VOTING FOR THEM??!*


- LASTLY......

*YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURS CANADA WISH YOU A SHIT TON OF LUCK BECAUSE WE WANT YOU YO HAVE A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE!* definitely we want to keep our allies HEALTHY!

PS****also we could do without the 50,000 of you that are sneaking across our borders on boats using the Alaska loophole then turning off ur boats tracker and then NOT EVEN HAVING THE DECENCY TO QUARANTINE YOURSELF FOR 14 days. The fines will be going up, I promise. Your country (USA) isn’t letting anyone in except for ESSENTIAL
TRAVEL. Because of the pandemic.


**********NOTICE TO BOATS TRAVELLING ACROSS TO BC THAT NEED ⛽️GAS WHEN THEY CROSS
THE BORDER TO CANADA 🇨🇦AND STOP AT OUR ISLANDS*********

*Especially the boaters ⛵️coming across at the western side via the water in BC/ Vancouver*

... we have small islands there!! With native Indian populations that boats only stop for gas ⛽️at. *Please DO NOT* get off your boat and go into
The shops without gloves and masks
And touch EVERYTHING please!!!  😷😷 

There are *NO HOSPITALS* 🏥on those islands. When they get sick with covid they die 😵easily because they must take a boat to a hospital, and it’s still an hour drive once they land their boat in the harbour in some cases. Please be mindful of these small vulnerable communities I beg of you!!!* there are elderly and secluded populations. 

Be respectful and Wear masks and have your kids stay ON BOARD when you stop, and pick up whatever they need yourself, if they are too young or unable to wear masks and avoid touching everything!!

*****PLEASE RESPECT THE BORDERS*****

There are #13,000 of you floating on boats in British Columbia near Vancouver. 

If you MUST ignore us and come, fucking **quarantine** yourself & **wear masks** ALL THE TIME (how do you think we’re not sick!!?) - and stay on lockdown because WE ARE ON LOCKDOWN. We have been for months. I haven’t seen my OWN FUCKING FAMILY FOR MONTHS. No parks & no restaurants and no hotels and no fun stuff. NOTHING! let’s keep it that way :-) 

If you follow those rules -
Personally speaking, we are happy to keep you safe. 
I know the country doesn’t feel that way as a whole. You’re not allowed here. But i would be happy to
Have some Americans come if they’re really scared and promise to Behave And not ruin it for us. Much love. We know the pandemic blows.

By the way, this obituary is completely fake. It was written by a guilt tripping 5th grader and looks evil and sarcastic, like someone who desperately wants people to believe In Covid and guilt trips about a virus that doesn’t exist.

Then you once again, wash them frequently. And i do it everyday and have for MONTHS as has my whole fam. Its NOT HARD to throw a fucking mask or face covering on... its really not. At all. If you wear a mask it protects any1 you come in contact with. Same with me same with everyone else who wears one. So you're not willing to help protect your fellow people!?! That's pretty fucked up. If everyone social distanced and wore a mask i guarantee we would have WAY less deaths. Thats all you gotta do.. wear a face covering or mask. but GOD FORBID THEY ASK THAT OF YOU! you almighty man. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄",2020-08-04 12:57:01

Using this method I now have an awesome group of friends who are always asking me what’s up and if I’m down to hang out and it’s no longer a one way street. 

My favorite is a childhood friend I still see on occasion. I no longer invite her to lunch or for drinks because she has never invited me anywhere or to do anything. The best part is she will text me or comment on my FB “miss you ☹️” and I’ll respond “miss you too!” and nothing happens lol.",2019-06-23 13:18:41

When she eventually caught it (like I kept warning her she would) and gave our entire family a huge scare from being around my oldest sister and her newborn child, she finally shaped the fuck up.

Granted this was after her week of quarantining bedridden, depressed, and guilty, feeling like she was gonna die and wondering if any of the family members she'd been around would catch it.

1. Once again, his stance on masks did not change because of evidence. He mislead us from the beginning. Him lying has NOTHING to do with a scientific process, and you know it.

2. No matter what  title you want to appropriate to him, he was one of the most prominent voices during the beginning of this pandemic, and people clinged onto his every word when this pandemic first began. 

3. The administration that put travel bans on China 2 weeks before the WHO recommended travel bans and declared an emergency? Was that mocking it? Didn’t the New York Times and the Washington post both say that the flu was worse than COVID 19? Oh right, the scientific process.

What the hell is that I've been seeing the last few weeks?

8lw7mh,"I only see it as one female shrugging figure. I think it's the way your device rendered the emoji. Some emojis are actually made up of multiple characters like one for the actual figure, and some other one called a modifier for the gender or even skin color. 

I think what's happening here is that their device is saying ""shrug+female modifier"" normally, devices would go

> Okay so shrug and make it female

But your device is going 

> Okay, so I put a shrug here and a female character here.

I'm not sure if it's fixed yet but Windows is known to do this. It often displays thumbs ups as the👍 and a colored square which should have been the skin color modifier",2018-05-24 23:48:54

A lot of men think because I cry or I'm sad I'm weak. Wrong...if you do those things ad fell that way you are a HUMAN. We out far too much emphasis on gender and what the opposite one with think of us as well as the same gender. Competing for power and to be ""top dog.""  We need more men to embrace their emotions because the reality is yall have them so stop trying to stuff them. It causes you so much more pain, suffering, heartache, lack of sleep. Health problems and I could go on and on. Embrace your feelings. Find someone who you feel safe enough to ve vulnerable with. That's another problem. Everyone is always so judgemental. ""I can't cry. They will look at me like I'm a puss.""

He was convicted because a jury of impartial citizens--that represent the **true** feelings of America--saw through the bullshit and enabled at least a punishment of some sort. He probably emotional raped her. Or visually raped her. Or existentially raped her. Which is bullshit that our dumb dumb caveman judiciary doesn't hold to the same standard as a physical sexual assualt.
*Unfortunately this terrible, terrible country thats so fucking backward Sudanese social policy is centuries ahead of ours.* Some land of the free.. At least he will, without a doubt, not have any animosity for the justice system. Or women. Or the current state of partisan politics. He learned a valuable lesson for being a man--women are the majority and are the force that everyone has to respect. Now.

1. You control your schedule. I could have graduated earlier then December, but being 36 a lot of life comes at you before you have time to change. If you need to take 1 or 2 classes do it don't be afraid to wait.
2. Don't be afraid to talk to your teachers. This is maybe more for me, but when I was younger I was scared of teachers. Remember YOU'RE 36!! You do adult stuff as well they will notice right away.
3. Love your time off. Take trips with the family, go the extra mile for kids and S/O. You will have to say NO too many times during your time in school. Make sure the times you don't have any school work get out and do something with family!

Keep strong brother! ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾",2020-09-11 01:15:56

i.e. If you call 911 because you’ve locked yourself out of your car, and there’s no emergency present (child or pet in the car, for example), we’ll show up and tell you to call AAA. It’s kinda the same for the elevator situation, except that we realize being locked in an elevator for hours on end can eventually spur some medical probs—not to mention be really annoying—so we’ll usually give it a shot.",2018-10-09 02:21:14

The same people that supported it are the same group of people that generally love to hunt but nobody even mentioned the impact of eradicating migration through a continent. 

Yes, I realize it's racist af and xenophobic, too. I just think it's ridiculous nobody brought up the shear arrogance of what it would do to the environment as well.  They even brought up a Canadian border wall during all this. The wildlife at our northern border would be devastated. Elk, deer,bear, wolves, foxes, etc.

83qfyr,"I'm not gonna lie. I see every slightly overweight women as a hideous tub of lard.

You're not beautiful on the inside, your arteries are so obstructed by saturated fat that you're quite literally less then seven years away a diebeties induced heart attack.

Don't sit there and tell me that it's not your own fault when it is precisely your own fault.

Becoming a tubby cunt does not just coincidently happen.
There is in fact an algorithmic process for how it happens and this is it.
A person consumes far more calories than he/she expends on a day-to-day basis.

Being fat isn't a disease it's the exact consequences of overconsumption and living a sedentary lifestyle.

But today's fat cunts can not accept that they and they alone are responsible for their own miserable health conditions, and since it's substantially easier to try and ""normalize"" their biologically suicidal lifestyle than it is to hit the fucking treadmill, naturally they try to make a virtue out of their biggest character defects.

z26alc,"lemme just preface this by saying i myself am gay and arab but bro what is so hard for y'all to understand? it's one thing to BE gay but it's a whole other thing to be going around in a arab muslim country LITERALLY wearing ur sexuality on ur sleeve. it's not like they have gaydars at security😂like you can be gay and wear literally anything else lol. not only that, and a lot of people tend to forget this fact, but arab muslim countries are pretty much against exhibiting ANY form of sexuality, even straight. and us members of the arab lgbt community understand that, which is why we don't share the same anger y'all do. and I get that the World Cup is a global stage, but that doesn't mean that you can act like you're still at home and don't have to follow the laws of the country you're in. also, everyone KNOWS how countries like Qatar think about the lgbt community. yet, many still went and put money into the pockets of a country that they claim ""doesn't welcome them"". so I guess seeing the world cup live was more important than upholding their own personal values. 

this approach is wrong and a lot of us in the arab lgbt community are just watching and laughing as we see y'all experience culture shock and call it oppression. being gay manifests in many different ways in countries around the world, and going around flaunting rainbows is definitely not part of how it manifests in the arab world. we don't wear rainbows and we don't feel oppressed for it. straight people also don't do pda and if there was a straight flag you wouldn't see them wearing it. that's because again, IN THIS COUNTRY, exhibiting any form of sexuality is looked down on and everyone living here respects that. so I don't see why people only visiting shouldn't respect that too. and if you don't respect that, just move to another country, or don't come it's really not that deep.",2022-12-13 16:50:11

z26alc,"Okay I mean no hatred or bigotry with this comment whatsoever, however it raises the ethical question of “what is she doing about the people getting killed for wearing the same thing to the same match?” 

What I mean: I have seen many a sad story from this past month of people of all ages, races, and orientations wearing the rainbow in support of those who are oppressed. So I personally feel it is of appropriate stature to try to help and/or monitor the safety or all the people who do wear said outfits to the World Cup games because they do not have the same protections and securities that she has; being the former Danish prime minister. Has anyone seen anything to support my comment? I just hope that they would have the decency to go above and beyond for people who share fellow sentiments, especially in a country which is known to have its own traditions and angry mobs who attack openly gay people of both genders. Maybe in a perfect world im making some sense but in this day and age im not too sure it’s even feasible, but I just hope they would do something on that end as well. However, fuck FIFA 💙👏🏽",2022-12-15 06:18:59

z26alc,"My view as an outsider who just loves the beautiful game called football: Piers Morgan was right when he called those who are complaining about Qatar not allowing certain things (like alcohol & LGBTQ) in their country hypocrites. With alcohol, I think they designated spots outside of the stadium for fans and of course in hotels. But NOBODY should go to another country and disrespect their customs & culture. Imagine people from the Middle East going to Europe & demanding that Europeans adhere to their culture. 'When in Rome do as the Romans do.' Where was the outcry 4 years ago when Russia hosted the FIFA World Cup? Were/are there migrant workers issues in Qatar? Of course! Qatar is one of the many nations in the middle east & North Africa that unfortunately still practices modern day slavery. That is a tragic fact but as for the minor issues of booze, sexuality etc give me a break😂 Those who genuinely love football will enjoy the football. Watch Gary Neville's documentary on YouTube where he visited Qatar. That should give one an insight of how things actually are. At the end of the day, the middle east was the only region in the world that didn't host a WC but now it has. Was Qatar the best choice? Maybe, maybe not but NO nation on earth has the moral authority to lecture others on human rights especially not Western nations like the UK & USA. Illegally invading & occupying Iraq (2003) & killing millions of Iraqi civilians is I guess 'acceptable' but hey let's turn a blind eye to that huh? Do Yugoslavia, Libya, Syria, Yemen ring a bell? Keep quiet and enjoy the football or don't go to Qatar at all😉 NOBODY is forcing you folks. I'm sick & tired of these virtue signalling hypocrites. GTFOH😂",2022-11-24 15:19:24

Also I will add earlier I was reading a local story about a teacher caught having a relationship with a student and someone commented about raising the pay to attract better candidates instead of scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to hiring teachers. Someone actually replied to the comment arguing against it saying “taxes are already too high” and “teachers should do their job without thinking of more money”. 🤦🏻‍♀️,2019-01-15 04:30:51

afyhbc,"(sorry if I'm echoing one or more of the other 300+ replies)
You forgot to mention the education bonds!! The people of CA keep okay-ing these bonds for schools to use and then the rich schools all end up getting the money because they have the fancy, expensive lawyers to help them submit for the bond money... My elementary school applied for bond money (the first time around) and by the time we FINALLY got approved to receive it, all they could give us was enough to replace the stage curtains in our multi-purpose room. We WANTED playground equipment but... Oh well, we got curtains. Elementary school kids need stage curtains after all 🙄",2019-01-14 22:46:31

6zx47v,"My dad did similar with me. Only I was too chickshit to pull the horn.

My dad was a Railroad Engineer for 30 years and a Conductor for ten years.

Some shifts my dad worked, I would ride with him to his job(my mom would work late sometimes), sit in the break rooms and eat donuts while I remember hearing his co-workers talking shit and laughing.

They had a small tv that hung up high, but it was never on. I remember them always having a radio playing the local rock station in the back.

The smell of coffee, metal, and leather always remind me of those times.

They also had a sweet vending machine that had a crap ton of stuff you could make a bugout bag with. They had these first aid kits that were awesome! I don't remember it costing anything.

 They also use to have a family day where you could ride(short distance) and explore the trains.

This was in Louisiana 1993...this will definitely not fly now. 

I do remember one time being out in the yard that someone was stealing one of the whistle piece on the top of the train. People will place them as their horns for their cars. Weeks later at a Mardi Gras parade, one of the tricked out cars had a whistle for their horn. Scared the crap out of some people😂. Also saw a few times people drawing graffiti on the cars.",2017-09-14 01:15:38

Whenever people think of how to channelize energy and hard work of daily toiling easier way than pulling trigger on a target or hunting would be to do gardening or go camping and try planting trees there. Clear some dry grass prevent forest fires happening. Set up misting water pipelines to make animals birds and humans beat the heat and relax. Spend time mending and fixing children play parks. Create hiking paths or make zip line fixtures.  Take to hiking or cycling use cameras to shoot nature!

(¹ Chicago has some of the strictest gun control laws but when you can drive out of the city to places with extremely lax gun laws, stricter controls can’t be successful. Yet somehow Chicago having gun related crime means that gun control doesn’t work, not the other way around.²

[² I have been told this exact take by a coworker and he refused to consider that if federal gun control was at the same level, Chicago would be able to actually implement them. Not that I hold the opinion of a man with two elementary school aged children and he told me that he’s willing to put his children at risk and if they die in a school shooting so be it, the second amendment is set in stone and nothing can stand in its way.

On the trip I proposed to my now wife, I told EVERYBODY that I was going to do it. Families, friends, waiters and bartenders, I told them all. 

I would lie and say I was showing pics of our dogs when really I had a note typed on my phone that read something like, “ I’m proposing on this trip and she has no idea, just tell her the dogs are cute” and it would light everyone up with a smile. And my wife the whole time was going” people are SUPER friendly this trip” 

Fast forward, she said yes (still hands down happiest moment of life) and then asked “what do I do?” To which her phone answered by exploding in text and tweets asking about our night and how it went so that’s when I told her I kept the biggest secret I ever had by telling everybody and their mother :)

 Video and photo from the place of impact on the TV tower in Kyiv with corpses - fake, video and photo released an hour after arrival, the corpses in the photo with signs of severe rigor mortis.

 Rigor mortis of this degree develops 4-6 or more hours after death.  There are more questions about corpses:

About it being a sedentary job, what kind of dynamic would you prefer or you think would be realistic to find? I just feel like most jobs in our field are sitting at desks and analyzing data. The onlt thing i can think that is more active is maybe a geophysicits, but even that must have moments where they do ""office work"".

Good luck on your trip, i'm sure you'll learn something valuable and don't settle until you're happy :)

urgucj,"I appreciate immensely your thought out reply, and I wouldn't want to misrepresent myself. I'm actively persuing different career paths but they are completely (hysterically) unrelated to my degree. Like I'm looking at being a pilot, or nurse for long term goals and looking at getting my home inspectors license for now. 

You know I think one of my umbrella fears is knowing I have to use the GI bill to go back to school and not being able to shake this insecurity over my mental state has left me nervous to pull the trigger out of fear of wasting my GI bill. 

But anyway, yes I completely agree with you and understand this is in my head. It's surprising, even to myself, how difficult it can be to escape being trapped in your own thoughts but I do keep my head above water enough to see enough reality to cope. I'll figure it out though, I always do.

Thanks again, and also, very happy to hear you shook your old habits and started to get physically fit again, your physical health is very tightly connected to your mental health so I can't imagine how much stronger you feel both physically and emotionally. Good on ya 👍",2022-05-17 12:43:51

Abortion is a difficult choice for some, but rarely a mental breaking event.  Most women find huge relief in their abortions.  Being pregnant is terrifying when you're hoping for it, and considerably more so if it's unexpected.  I imagine a 12 year old rape victim will need way more therapy due to the rape than the freaking abortion.

This whole lockdown has kinda messed with me in ways that I’m irritated to admit, but reading about so many great experiences and OP’s positive attitude makes me feel blessed that I made the choice to go back. I’m honestly pretty scared of the student debt and I’m hoping my field has recovered a bit more from all this economic mess by the time I’m done, but I really hope I have the opportunity to finish my degree. Sorry for the length, but it feels good to get it off my chest and to hope for the best.

7oym1s,"We had to put our retriever down last year, they are the sweetest things. He had epilepsy and though we kept him healthy and happy, he eventually developed neurological problems as a result of it. Almost made it to 9 years old 😭. Too young. His name was Bailey too. Thanks for this gallery.",2018-01-09 00:52:57
7oym1s,I started a new position in my job today and just today sent the I have no idea what I’m doing meme to my husband. Your dog was a beauty. ❤️,2018-01-09 00:58:14
7oym1s,She clearly loved to work! She’s lucky she had someone to give her so much attention ❤️,2018-01-09 15:27:19
7oym1s,"I am so very sorry for your loss. Now I know why I didn' t browse the pupper subs during work breaks as I usually do. All day I've been thinking about my Meg, the ""Rhodesian Whippet Princess"" who crossed the bridge 3 years ago today. Had I seen this post earlier, I'd have been reduced to an incoherent puddle of snot for the rest of the day. As it is, some fool started chopping onions just as I was about to try and get some sleep....😢

She was only 7?!? Way too soon. But she lived life to the fullest and brought a smile to so many of us hoomans. I never knew that so many of my favorite memes were all the same dog! While scrolling and sniffling through Bailey's album, she reminded me of Trixie Koontz, another beautiful, talented and fun loving Golden who ""wrote"" several books with her dad, Dean Koontz. They just seem to be the most joyful dogs of all.

RIP, sweet Bailey. Gonna give Duncan the Golden/GSD/??pound puppy extra hugs this week. He's 7 and still a puppy at heart, and has recently gotten his first few white chin hairs. Time to remind him he needs to stick around for, oh, at least another decade or so.

I never got outrageously beaten and anytime I ever got hit, I personally believe it was well deserved. I never got abused. I never got overly beaten.

 I got smacked to prove a point and learn a lesson for not listening to my parents and not doing my responsibilities assigned to me. Best believe any incident which that occurred, I didn’t make that mistake again.

 I was a kid/teen at the time and I will admit, I was a little shit head. I’m not mentally traumatized by it. But I learned how far to push my luck in disobeying my parents and not performing my responsibilities (to which I had agreed to) 🤷🏽‍♂️ I see nothing wrong. 

I also don’t believe that all tasks or chores should equate to financial compensation. Because no one is gonna pay you to do it for yourself when you are older. Chores and things of that nature are life skills that you don’t appreciate until you get older and are Independent.",2019-06-23 04:17:03

This is how works of fiction begin, and I bet you that the new generation will buy into all the propaganda of Capitalism and free markets and think all you need is to pick yourself up, work hard, and have a little luck. 

P.S Please don't conflate my argument with me not being awestruck to the inventions and milestones that SpaceX is doing. Rather, I'm saying that if it weren't for ""us"" the tax payer paying for this we wouldn't be in the position that we are in.

>Novak's home holds a horror show. In his M Street yard, one dummy lies with his head pulverized, one lies with a scale where his or her head used to be, and a few more lie in bloodied trash bags fallen off a wheelbarrow. All the while, in the window of the house, a zombie horde attempts to break out.

>“I’m most proud of the wheelbarrow tipped over by the street full of Hefty bags, looking like a failed attempt to dispose of the dismembered bodies in the middle of the night.” Novak says. “A kid walked by and asked me what happened to them; I said they ate too many Skittles.”

>Novak hasn’t lost his neighborly spirit. He keeps his overall Leave it to Beaver demeanor, even with the bloodshed. “It was raining a lot and washing the blood away so I indefatigably ‘watered’ the bodies every morning for a while to the dismay of early dog walkers and joggers saying as they passed ‘Watering the bodies!’”

>Novak's decorations have brought the police to his house multiple times.

>“Neighbors told me cop cars were in front of my house a lot during the day,"" he says. ""I was only home twice to receive them. They told me they thought it was cool and that they were only there because they were required to reply to complaints from the sergeant. Novak continues, while laughing, “They were in formation at the door and when I opened it they asked me if it was all mine. I asked, ‘You mean the blood and the bodies? Yeah, that’s me.""

>“Honestly, though, I think I could’ve used more,"" Novak says. ""[My plans] were way worse on paper. Next year though!”

hxe9wc,"I held her in my arms as we put her down.

I was teary eyed (and dying inside of course) but steadfast because I knew she was in so much pain and this is all we could do. I tried not to cry because I wanted her to see me happy and petting her as she went.

It was earlier, when she got sickest from the cancer, stopped being herself, eventually couldn’t use her hind legs, and would bite them in frustration that I was ballin’ out the tears. When I got the call at work that she was at the hospital and I headed out I was also super distraught.

She would always try to comfort me (lick my face) when I cried.

Edit: ah fuck here come the tears 🌊😞

Edit2: 

I think all of us in the room (my mom who she adored) acting happy is what makes it less awful to remember. 

Yes she died in my arms but we made that last moment about her. 

. No one left her alone with a stranger.

. We were all acting normally nice to her, taking to each other as well as if we were in the living room, and happily petting her a lot.

. We played with her (immobility +tranqz meant she could only push back her favorite ball softly with her nose) as best we could.

. We were all smiling with her as best we could when she fell asleep that one last time. 

. At the end we made sure my mom (her favorite) was the only one talking as I petted her.",2020-07-25 08:31:41

hxe9wc,"I’m sorry for your loss. It’s definitely okay to cry a lot. I feel like I cried for a couple weeks straight after my dogs passed away last month. It has gotten easier over all, but there are moments that still feel incredibly painful. I will always miss my pups. They were family to me as I’m sure your cat was to you. It’s okay to feel this way, don’t beat yourself up for it— we all have a unique grieving and healing process for those we loved.

It’s not that they went to college, are in debt, and can’t find a well paying job with their degree and have to work shitty jobs to just pay the bills. 

Also I don’t think anyone was unlucky enough to not get a chance to get a higher education due to being born in a low-income family, resulting in very limited opportunities for career growth (i.e. single mom working multiple jobs to keep family afloat) 

Nah, everyone is just lazy and thinks they CANNOT earn more money, what freaking idiots, right?

jq0lb4,"He hasn't ""won"" at all yet.  The Media is just predicting/ assuming he will.  The final numbers are originally totaled up mid-December by each state and reported in.  And in THIS case, with DemocRat voter fraud evidence/ witnesses across all four battleground states, possibly more, all the legal cases opened up and ordering recounts....

And what ever happened to masks and ""social distancing?""  They look a bit close there! 🤣

gmqxn3,"My son has Autism and has always attended schools that were always majority African-American students. When he was 8 he came home and asked me what a “black school” was. I was FLOORED! We had never heard him talk about race before. I asked him what he meant and he told us that the aide in his class got mad at him today and said, “You need to hurry up and go back to your school. This is a black school you don’t belong here.” He asked me, “Mommy is it a black school because the walls are painted black?” I sat him down and said, “You know how our skin color is very light and some people have  darker skin colors? Well people refer to others based on their skin color.” Being a very literal kid he says, “BUT MOM! They are brown not black. And what does it matter? Jesus love all the children. If you go in the sun you turn red!” I said, “baby it doesn’t matter AT ALL what color someone skin is. The only thing that matters is the type of person they are!” That’s all he needed to hear. Race hasn’t been mentioned again. (The aide is no longer allowed to work with children.) WE ARE ALL OF ONE BODY OF CHRIST. Meaning your “black”(I hate that reference) arm is NO different then my white arm. We ALL bleed the same! ❤️",2020-05-19 20:33:38
gmqxn3,"I too was adopted. They got me just a few days after my birth. I found out I was adopted around the age of 11. I was sitting at the kitchen counter with my best friend while my mom was cooking us breakfast and somehow the topic of adoption came up.   My bff said, “well you know because you’re adopted.” 

And that was how I found out.....

It all made sense bc I didn’t look like them and I had constant medical problems and then I started to become heavy early on so I REALLY didn’t look like them. I just was DIFFERENT. 

I have a son, a 25 year old biological son. My one true dna. He means the world to me. I would of loved to of have more kids but it was not in the cards for me. As it was I had 3 miscarriages and that was traumatic enough for me to stop trying. 

Posts like these where they reunite just give me unbelievable squishies. It gives me hope of a brighter day and future. I look so forward to your new pic. That will be amazing. TY for sharing your story. ❤️",2020-05-19 20:35:05

Then our bio mom gave birth to a baby boy who was adopted as an infant straight from the hospital and his parents didn’t tell him. Over the years we exchanged Christmas cards with a photo every year and we always knew that was our little brother but I’m not really sure who he thought we were. We connected as adults and he asked me what I thought when I “found out” I was like whatchu mean I was there for the whole thing 😂 and he told me he didn’t know until he was like 12 when his parents told him. I also thought it was a bit funny because my brothers look almost identical and are tan skin, curly dark hair. Both of his parents are blondies.",2020-05-20 15:31:53

12f0f49,"The Paradox of Tolerance disappears if you look at tolerance, not as a moral standard, but as a social contract. If someone does not abide by the terms of the contract, then they are not covered by it. In other words: The intolerant are not following the rules of the social contract of mutual tolerance. Since they have broken the terms of the contract, they are no longer covered by the contract, and their intolerance should NOT be tolerated.

(Not my words, [quoting those who have come before](https://media.mstdn.social/media_attachments/files/109/502/627/167/839/720/original/8391084138cf4fff.png). Those interested can google ""paradox of tolerance social contract"" to see many variations on the concept.)

w6yf1u,"These photos are interesting, sure, but a) I'd never go to NK and financially support a dictatorship and I think it's kinda bs to brush that off for ""a learning experience"" considering b) EVERYTHING YOU SAW, they wanted you to see. There was a camera man following you, you had a guide, you weren't allowed to leave on your own. As much as they may have tried to make it seem that way, you did NOT see how the majority of NK people live on a day to day basis. You said in your post ""they do symmetry well in this country"" when it seems to be ONLY applicable to the capital aka the place they want tourists to see and think how well NK is doing. You even point out how poorly the roads are maintained in rural areas by comparison!!! You then say in a comment ""oh yeah from what I saw most people can live totally normal lives mhmm"" when, again, everything that you saw was carefully cultivated. You did not have a genuine experience. You did not see what the reality of NK or what the quality of life is like for the vast majority of its residents. To claim otherwise is so, so shortsighted and entirely arrogant - they showed you a version of NK to promote it as ""not so bad"" and you entirely bought into it, and are now trying to share the same rhetoric here. Your post very much gives off the vibes of ""Oh yeah its a weird country but hey look how nice this city is and since I didn't personally see any trauma or have the opportunity to speak openly with someone who wasnt being paid or intimidated into interacting with me it must be that everything I've heard about NK is false and now everyone should go visit!!"".

Sorry that your shitty grandfather was such a bad boss someone had to do something cool about it. 🤷

The point of unions is it's the only way working class folks can come close to getti g paid what we're worth. The market for non-unionized labor is worse than for unionized labor because unionized labor gives workers the power to demand a meaningful wage. Don't like it? Join a fucking union. You want to see lazy, entitled, and greedy? Look at a business owner. Look at a landlord. Look at an investor. People who believe that simply having bought something entitles them to all of the value created by the people who work for them.

Fuck off with that sanctimonious shit. If the union stagehands or whatever are making $100/hr, take your complaints up with the free market. Don't blame the union for providing good pay to people who work for a living, and, again, built the fucking world (which is what the working class did and does).

Nobody gives a shit about your little grievances about unions being too good at giving people a good wage. The fact is, all workers should have at least that high a wage, that much freedom, and that much autonomy.

So yeah, as a union man, I think what you just described is fucking great! I want it for every worker.",2021-10-16 18:31:35

Now working in a COVID lab where, IF, a doctor comes down, instead of just ringing and demanding as per, it's to patronisingly explain how they need a patient specimen run on our machines. Like we don't know how to use them. Brings a whole new level of invisibility. It's like people think their tests just get magically done. 
Our cleaners are the best, overworked and underpaid - obviously!  We frequently have chats with them when they're down in the basement with us. To all the unseen and out of sight workers - big hugs guys💕",2020-08-13 20:38:10

Besides the obvious (stay home, social distance and wash your hands like you are putting contacts in after cutting jalapeños), I would say emotional support. A lot of people are not doing well mentally right now... Let them know you support their emotional wellbeing and offer to be an ear if needed. Just knowing a safe outlet is there may be enough to make a tremendous impact on someone who is silently struggling. And be kind.",2020-04-30 19:30:59

gb00j5,"First off, thank you, for everything! And second, heroism is being scared and doing it anyway. I know you’re terrified and exhausted, probably depressed, definitely traumatized, and maybe even a little hungry. But despite all this, you’re still doing it and THAT’S what makes you a hero. You’re helping keep all of us safe at great personal risk and/or cost and you’re not asking for anything in return. That’s certainly a hero in my book. I’m immunocompromised, and my parents are elderly with underlying conditions, so we’ve stayed home now for almost two months. I wish I could wrap my arms around you and everyone else who needs a hug right now. But all I have to give is my extreme gratitude for all that you do. Thank you. I hope this all ends soon and that we as a community don’t ever forget you and your colleagues’ sacrifice for our wellbeing. ❤️",2020-04-30 20:06:58
gb00j5,"💜I feel your pain. Healthcare workers don’t need passer by fluff compliments that they are hero’s. They need systemic changes from policy makers to readjust situations like this from getting out of hand. Many still don’t have proper PPE and even crisis pay, are understaffed and overworked. People want to show appreciation, then please help change many policies that this situation has shed on, don’t allow corruption to dictate systems anymore.",2020-04-30 19:59:30

gb00j5,"Your work is relentless, heartbreaking and exhausting - No doubt about it. but I assure you that every patient you help beat this is so grateful for you showing up, day after day, and doing what you can. Nobody expects you to be a hero. But showing up day after day and not giving up? That's the definition of heroic. We all appreciate everything you are doing 💗",2020-04-30 20:28:27
gb00j5,"As a husband of an ED nurse, and my wife rolls her eyes at all the heroic posts and memes, she feels the same. Her hospital is furloughing directors and nurses from the other floors and maybe the ED soon too. She's never worried about not being to work and help people. She's emotional exhausted, physically exhausted, and we have 3 boys we're trying to make sure they get all their school stuff done at home as well as me still having to work 50+ hours a week too. Every person I know that works with my wife I want to do whatever I can for. I can't cook for them currently because the whole food sharing is a no-no, so it's hard to find a way to show appreciation for all they do. 

So for you internet stranger, I appreciate everything you do, every day, for all your patients. Everyone that has a direct connection to a patient deserves to be treated better and compensated accordingly. All of you deal with more than I can ever imagine as a non-health care person. You are all some of the strongest people I know. ❤️❤️",2020-04-30 20:48:03

I took this online course which consists of 7 videos by a well respected and great mystic of our time, Sadhguru. It used to cost some money but it is provided free of charge to all health care workers and offered at half price for anyone else. It has helped me and millions of other people tremendously.

Yeah, that buddy of mine I was talking about, received the plane from a carrier to get serviced and found a head of the crew or handler attached to the plane or something.

I would've been like fuckkkk. Just thinking about it creeps me out.

[Here's the story about it.](http://www.topix.com/forum/prisons/uss-dwight-d-eisenhower-cvn-69/T5JC78ID5C2C4JQLT/navy-sailor-killed-aboard-ship)

> ABH2 was kneeling too far back and in the way of the 103 aircraft. the 103 aircraft was instructed to take off when ABH2 stood up simultaneously. as the 103 aircraft proceeded off the catapult, the wingtip missile launcher, void of a missile, hit ABH2 somewhere above his shoulders and killed him instantly. 

> i heard that the sailor was decapitated and that ***the head was impaled on the lau-7 missle launcher and that once on land, the head had to be split by a chain saw to be removed from the launcher***

a08uf1,"People who think this is oil, it MAY be a naturally occurring rainbow due to light filtering through the trees (or another phenomena) like OP said. One indicator is the larger sized chunks of each color strip leading me to believe that the light diffusion is happening at a larger distance. Oil that I have seen usually has thin strips that swirl and show blotchy colors...

On the other hand, I DO believe the corrupt Gov is trying to reduce our life expectancies and poison our earth.

The panels were put up in 1979 and stayed on for 7 years! They were taken down 2  years into Reagan’s SECOND TERM.  They were removed to repair the roof in 1986.  

They didn’t even generate electricity ..  they heated SOME of the water for the WH cafeteria.  Plus .. i think Reagan had more to worry about than these useless  Solar panels and would bet he wasn’t that involved in the roof repair decisions.    

It’s fun to make stuff up to make  it sound like he hated the environment soooo much that as soon as he took office he had the useless things ripped off.  And on the way down from the roof he stomped on a homeless black woman. And kicked a man dying of AIDS.",2022-10-11 12:45:39

Other prominent lunchroom were rife with Styrofoam,  plastic, famous chili, burgers, etc. I asked the organizers what the deal was and he was like ""oh, this is the House side and the democrats are in charge. Those other spots are on the republican controlled senate building.""

I asked what happens when they flip, and they said the incoming regime is in there overnight making sure the thousands of visitors that come through each day see what's most important.

808ddp,"When I went to school, my teacher is put me on the low income list without my knowledge because they would see me do things like ask for a pencil or a piece of paper to write notes on.

Also any kind of school work that required a computer, I would stay late and use the computer lab.

I wasn't low-income though, I was in a fairly average income home, I just had extremely cheap parents.

About the time when it became common for every classmate to have a computer and internet in the house, when I asked for a computer so that I could do my homework at home, they bought me a word processor. 😒

Before a car, the first thing I bought after I had my first job in high school was a computer which cost about $3,000 at the time.

Since “beggars can’t be choosers” he wore women’s jeans and other items of clothing for many years of his life until his parents were able to afford shopping at secondhand stores and he could make more choices. 

It’s hard for parents and children to just tell people “hey, yeah we’re poor”, so having options like what your wife has provided makes it less embarrassing while allowing them to have some basic human products they may not have been able to afford. 🙏 ",2018-02-26 03:39:04

htzc1v,"It's a combination of working fairly intricately and developing a process that you can stick to. If you start with the assumption that you'll work til it's done instead of working until you're done, then every time you come back you can reassess and continue the work. At least that's how it is for me. 

It's less trying to get 3 things done every time and more understanding what you're hoping to feel when you look at the finished work. If you don't feel it yet, it isn't done. ☺",2020-07-19 15:44:08

x2dx6q,"I used to work at a big outdoor retailer, and the amount of people that came into the store to get outfitted for a long backpacking/hiking trip without any previous experience, was scary. 

They have this romanticized idea of casual walks through beautiful scenery, with campfires at night, and cozy sleep on a plush meadow or clearing, and they don't understand how brutal it can be at times. 

They forget how many miles even just a quarter of a full through-hike is, the wear on your body and gear, lack of shower opportunities, risk of injuries, and how shitty the weather can turn out sometimes. 

Then, of course, they have never bought more than regular sneakers all their life, and they don't want to listen to my advice and recommendations, and choose the cute boot over the much more functional one. Ill-fitting or inappropriate footwear will, at a minimum, probably cause blisters or painful pressure points. That shit is agonizing when you have miles and miles to go, with weeks ahead of you. 

It's really frustrating, and there were some couples that I legit worried about when they left the store. Best case scenario, they had a horrible time and just got turned off from hiking forever. Worst case scenario, well...

EDIT: I just want to make clear, I had *no* idea what goes into proper footwear until I started working at my store. 
It was an overwhelming amount of information that never even occurred to me previously.  

So, I don't think customers are stupid for not knowing all these things that have just become basic knowledge to *me*, due to my job. Nobody thinks of that shit until they seriously look into it.
Don't be afraid to ask questions. I assure you, and as is evident here, we *love* to talk about this stuff and will happily teach you if you're willing to listen. 😊",2022-08-31 14:59:33

>
>There are various ways we can help Hong Kong from abroad:
>
>* ⁠\[**US**\] A few options here:
>   * Urge your representatives to support the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 \[[H.R. 3289](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3289?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [S. 1838](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1838?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\]. You can use this website to [send a pre-composed letter](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/co-sponsor-hong-kong-human-rights-and-democracy-act-of-2019?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). 
>   * There is also the Protect Hong Kong act of 2019 \[[H.R. 4270](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr4270/BILLS-116hr4270ih.pdf)\] that you can ask your representatives to co-sponsor. 
>   * Talk to your representatives. Find their contact [through this website](https://www.callmycongress.com/).
>* ⁠\[**UK**\] Petition to the UK government to uphold the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. [Link here](https://petition.standwithhk.org/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). You can also write to your members of Parliament. [Find out how](https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/contact-your-mp/).
>* \[**Canada**\]  [Write an open letter](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/constituencies/FindMP) condemning the Hong Kong government and demanding that the Canadian government sanction Hong Kong and propose concrete action to support protesters.
>* \[**Australia**\] Quite a few options here:
>   * [Join a petition](https://www.change.org/p/the-senate-of-australia-impose-sanctions-on-persons-found-to-be-suppressing-human-rights-in-hong-kong-df999fe5-3d9f-434b-8f58-d0840619a046) to impose sanctions on people found to be suppressing human rights in Hong Kong. 
>   * Petition the Australian House of Representative to bring the true condition of Hong Kong’s predicament to the United Nations Human Rights Council \[[Petition EN1029](https://www.aph.gov.au/petition_sign?id=EN1029)\]. 
>   * Petition Australia to add Human Rights clauses to the Australia - Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement \[[Petition E1032](https://www.aph.gov.au/petition_sign?id=EN1032)\] 
>   * You can also just [write to your senators and members of Parliament](https://www.aph.gov.au/senators_and_members/guidelines_for_contacting_senators_and_members).
>* \[**New Zealand**\] [Write to your members of Parliament](https://www.govt.nz/browse/engaging-with-government/members-of-parliament/).
>* \[**Everywhere**\] A few small things that anyone can do, regardless of country
>   * Here is [a list of companies](https://github.com/caffeine-overload/bandinchina?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that have bowed to China’s various censorship demands, over Hong Kong and other issues. Do what you will with that information. (More on this at r/BoycottChina)
>   * You can write a message to the government of Hong Kong through [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/take-action/stop-the-hong-kong-extradition-bill/). It’s only a small gesture, but quick and easy to do.
>   * [Petition the United Nations](https://www.change.org/p/condemn-hong-kong-police-for-excessive-force-against-citizens-call-for-independent-inquiry) to condemn Hong Kong Police for excessive use of force and call for an independent inquiry. 
>   * [Request the International Court of Justice](https://www.change.org/p/international-court-of-justice-request-international-court-of-justice-to-investigate-excessive-force-of-hong-kong-police) to investigate use of excessive force by the Hong Kong Police.
>* If your country isn't on this list, it may be [in this post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cv0ws4/how_can_you_help_hong_kong_protests_from_abroad/) I only added certain countries to keep the comment more condensed.
>
>This is [an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cjj9f3/us_bill_to_impose_sanctions_on_chinese_and_hong/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) of when your involvement has helped the people of Hong Kong.

kuv85c,"What do you mean they didn't bring weapons? An undeniable fact? From which source?


You can literally Google ""how many weapons at Capitol Hill riots."" The cursory results give you the number LE confiscated by end of day Wednesday. Not sure that includes the truck with molotovs and assault rifle, or the Meredith guy who brought a couple of guns to 'shoot Pelosi in the noggin,' or another woman who texted people she was bringing armor piercing ammo. 🤷 That's not even including whatever they were allowed to take back home with them. Munchel from Tennessee had something strapped in a holster, don't know what. There was also a cooler with molotovs inside, separate from 70 y.o. Alabama man's truck. There were the two pipebombs, radios, militia groups in combat gear, bear spray, tazors, zip tie cuffs. 


A lot of the attackers used flag poles to beat police, people with Oath Keeper patches had long, wooden walking sticks too. Indian police use them to beat people.


'No weapons' is more alternative fact than 'undeniable' fact my friend.",2021-01-11 15:10:25

kuv85c,"I've seen a LOT more individuals involved in BLM saying ""we see the double standard here, again, which is infuriating, but ultimately we aren't asking you to kill these people on the capitol steps, just use the same restraint as you use on white rioters when you're dealing with BLM protesters."" Just because there are people who wanted skulls to crack doesn't mean that most of us were just pissed to see the double standard in action *during a literal terrorist attack* because the terrorists were white. This mob contained people making threats on Mike Pence's life before storming the building he was in. This mob contained men with equipment to take hostages and torture or kill them. This mob was cover for multiple pipe bombs. That context makes the double standard all the more infuriating. Because when white people threaten officers, threaten people's lives, erect gallows and break into buildings after announcing intent to murder the people in that building, the cops show they are highly trained to be restrained in dangerous situations. So why is it that black folks keep getting shot in the back as they run away? And that's been the messaging from all the BLM leaders I've seen. 🤷🏻‍♀️

If anything this event kinda reaffirms the belief that cops are bastards. There were a bunch rubbing shoulders with terrorists. Sure, there were a couple heroes protecting the people in that building, but literally no one has called for there to be no officers trained to protect people from murderers. Just that they disproportionately assault black people who aren't a significant or immediate threat. Which was shown to be the case again when an all-white mob attacked the line of officers and no one deployed tear gas or pepper balls or rubber bullets. This officer did what cops are supposed to do. That's why we venerate him. Deescalation is literally all anyone has been asking for, we're just sick of only seeing it when white people are a threat.",2021-01-11 14:48:32
kuv85c,"ok, let me dumb it down for you. 


Bastard- an unpleasant or despicable person. 

Bastardized- to corrupt or debase. 


Nobody said all cops are bastards. We’re saying all cops are bastardized, meaning they work for a corrupt system and the police force in general is being affected by it. I PERSONALLY am studying to be a detective, and can still understand how corrupt the police system currently is. Therefore. All cops are bastardized.

""Turning off the news"" will solve the unemployment rate reaching an all-time high this year, the insufficient minimum wage for even skilled and educated low-income earners, or the absence of rent control or frozen rent despite the above two issues.

(Jesus christ the fuckin hypocrisy is deafening so let me spell it out for you.

>most people live on one meal a day

Living on 3 meals of processed garbage isnt much of an improvement when you had to work three jobs to afford it.

>thousands of people die from diseases like Malaria, Pneumonia, and Diarrhea

[america dealing with covid-19](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States)

The Trump administration initially responded by declaring a public health emergency on January 31. On February 2, it began to prevent the entry of most foreign nationals who had recently traveled to China. The initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, or testing for the virus. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump downplayed the threat posed by the virus and claimed the outbreak was under control.

A second rise in infections began in June 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several states. In August, the U.S. topped five million confirmed cases while also doing the most per capita testing of any other country. 

Its death rate had reached 499 per million people, the tenth-highest rate globally.



> diseases that kill virtually no one in first world countries like the US because those countries have easy and safe methods to prescription drugs for those diseases.

k9gelq,Why you talking about yourself bruh 😂,2020-12-09 03:20:08
k9gelq,"its not even related to the comment above yours... sorry but in general it’s common sense to try to be nice by default, yes, even on the internet where it seems easier to hide behind an anonymous profile. Why? Because spreading pointless negativity actually has an impact, even if its only felt on the small scale, but imagine if we all did the same?
So yeah, sometimes it’s only funny for yourself, and that’s why when you have these funny thoughts, think first about how others might feel or be impacted by them, and keep them to yourself.

Or don’t... but don’t be surprised if you get downvoted for it. 

You’re interacting with real humans, and believe it or not... even if it feels like life doesn’t make sense, 2020 is fucked up, nothing matters because the future is doomed, we feel like we’re interacting with machines, and our small tiny miserable random actions won’t matter on the grand scheme of things... it’s true... but it’s also easy to be nice randomly, so I chose to believe in karma, and so does the reddit community and its creators. So we feel forced to reply to people like you to point at bad behaviours in hope of making this place a better and safer place for all.

Believe me, I don’t even blame you for your comments, I’m just trying to give you another perspective, and sorry if I might have sounded condescending, or patronizing, or mad,  or even mean. I’m really not. At the end of the day, it’s the internet, and none of this matters. No one might read this comment ever and thank you if you’ve been reading until now. In any case I still wish you a good day, and hopefully I made a difference and didn’t write all of this for nothing.

4. An independent inquiry into police brutality

kztxth,"To be fair, you have to have to be very brave to criticize Putin. The cult of personality is extremely prevalent, and without a solid grasp of political theory most of the lies will go over a typical citizen’s head. There's also Alexei’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these criticisms, to realise that they're not just contrarianism - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Alexei truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Alexei existential catchphrase ""Путин лижет жаб ,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Alexei Navalny's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Alexei Navalny tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2021-01-18 18:19:45

h8fcw9,"Nah, I don't think so homie. 

#*All Lives Matter*™ is not, nor has it ever been inclusive.

Based on social media data we can evaluate the sincerity of the movement.

The hashtag #AllLivesMatter was used **14,308 times** on the day of the announcement that there would be no grand jury indictments in the Michael Brown case.

Source: [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/08/15/the-hashtag-blacklivesmatter-emerges-social-activism-on-twitter/)


The source notes further:

>The day in which the hashtag #AllLivesMatter appeared the most during this time period was Dec. 21, 2014, the day after two police officers were killed in New York City while in their patrol car. **That day the hashtag appeared 28,526 times.** **The hashtag #BlueLivesMatter, usually used to express support for police, was used 22,834 times that day.**

*All Lives Matter* is not used to any significant extent towards any other social justice cause:

>**In contrast to the use of #BlackLivesMatter, posts which used #AllLivesMatter in a positive manner were less likely to connect their posts with a broader social agenda.** Only 7% of the tweets using #AllLivesMatter took this position. Notably – and in contrast to the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag – #AllLivesMatter did not have a specific organization backing it or promoting its use in its early stages.

*All Lives Matter* has never been about 'all lives'. It's been about denigrating Black lives.",2020-06-13 21:23:30
h8fcw9,"I am perfectly okay with you believing that all lives don’t matter. I am not a “big supporter” of any movement called all lives matter. I am just a believer that all lives matter. If you truly think that black lives matter more than any other life, there is nothing that can be done to sway you.

Here’s a question I want you to ask yourself; What about all the black cops that get killed or hurt my BLM “protesters.” Do their lives matter less? What about all the black deaths caused by gang violence, why hasn’t BLM protested gangs? 

Also, nice copy paste. 👍",2020-06-13 21:30:59

who gives a fuck? Even if it was what is the point of banning a girl for having rainbow anything? Is literally any color on the spectrum of light now against God, who literally willed it into existence? Are we also going to forget that the Bible mentions rainbows as a promise to never flood the earth again?

Those don't even matter in this context, but it does show that a lot of ""Christians"" aren't very godly. I'm not even the most devout Christian out there but if this is what continues to be the norm for Christians I'm gonna just dissociate from them

Secondly, reading the comments in this thread is hilarious. 

Why would anyone be annoyed or upset at the ex wife on behalf of a stranger you know nothing about in a divorce situation you know nothing about concerning how the divorce ended up that way.

I don't think it's healthy to suggest that if people just do the Right Magic Thing™ (in this case, marrying their best friend) then everything will work out. Sometimes you do everything right and your marriage falls apart anyway. But you don't have to live in constant fear of that fact -- you can be realistic without being cynical.",2021-11-16 05:20:34

And god forbid you have to cancel.  In other words overall costs have not gone down at all.  

Funny how bus seats haven't gotten any less comfortable in the past 40 years.  Still the same amount of luggage too.  Same price.

The ventilator was supposed to be just temporary. It’s a long story but she got sick in august, went through surgeries and was in a rehab facility working on coming home. Then she got pneumonia and was able to consent to the ventilator cause the doctors said it would be temporary while she healed. Then they found that she had an infection around her heart and MRSA. She was starting to recover and then she had a stroke. A week ago today. And that it was it. It was massive, no chance of recovery and we knew she didn’t want to live with machines keeping her alive so we had to let her go. 

Her funeral is Tuesday. Sometimes I’m fine. Completely and utterly fine and then out of nowhere I’ll be crying and I have no idea what triggered it or where it came from. Grief is crazy like that. I mean, I lost my dad when I was 7 and my stepdad in 2013 but losing them is nothing, nothing compared to mom. 

What they don’t tell you anywhere is what exactly you’re supposed to do when someone says they’re sorry. It’s okay and thank you both just feel weird and saying nothing sounds rude. Grief man, makes you fixate on the weirdest things",2020-11-16 05:47:56

juz8ro,"I feel compelled to add my story here.  My dad wasn’t young, and had 2 previous heart surgeries.  I was young (19) and in nursing school when he wound up on a ventilator.  My mother was already chronically ill.  My father cared for her.  He was our rock.  That man played softball with my sister in his 70s.  He raised a total of 6 amazing children.  He was flawed and he raised us in less than perfect conditions with a less than perfect partner.  He showed me that life wasn’t perfect but was so very worth it. We had talked about his health and that he didn’t want to linger or live on life support.  He spent a week ventilated in the ICU waiting to see if the pneumonia would clear, waiting to see if he would be strong enough for surgery and begging for the tube to be taken out during every sedation vacation.  Begging to be let go, and one afternoon I broke.  I sobbed so exhausted from caring for my mother, worrying about being away from school and all of the family problems we had.  That nurse held me and although I’m sure he was uncomfortable as hell with a teenage girl begging him to take her father off the ventilator, he talked me off the edge.  He reminded me that the fact that my father could communicate me was a good sign.  He reminded me that I was so tired and needed to take a break. I did, and my dad recovered.  We had nine more great months with my father before he passed in his sleep.  I wish I had thanked that nurse more for that talk and those nine months, because my father and I spoke daily.  He reconciled with his children from his first marriage that he hadn’t talked to in a decade.  He made peace.

I could tell a thousand stories of how my mother’s home health nurses loved us kids as much as they cared for her, or the stories that I from my own career and those of my coworkers.  For now I will say, thank a nurse, a cna, a hospital chaplain or anyone caring for those who are ill, we can use all the extra thanks you can spare right now. ❤️❤️",2020-11-16 11:53:27

You are valuable beyond words. Thank you for everything you've done. ❤️",2020-11-16 06:46:47
juz8ro,"SARS-CoV-2 is not, primarily, a respiratory illness. It's becoming increasingly apparent that it's an overall inflammatory condition. As such people don't die from respiratory failure, or at least from respiratory failure alone, but from kidney failure, heart failure, clotting disorders, systemic organ failure, etc etc

You've probably heard references to the virus causing a ""cytokine storm"" - that is an inflammatory cascade (cytokines are pro-inflammatory proteins that are a vital part of the innate immune system's armoury against infection - the innate immune system being the half of the immune system that isn't about antibodies) and while inflammation is a natural part of our body's defence against invasive pathogens, as with many things too much of a good thing very quickly becomes a bad thing.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm

So, patients on respirators, all the respirator can do is take over for their damaged lungs/do their breathing for them. It can't do anything about all the other organs and body systems that the virus is attacking, nor can it do anything about the body's own defence system over-reacting and accidentally destroying itself. ie, blowing up the entire building when it was only supposed to blow the bloody doors off 😉

This is what has me, and every other healthcare professional or infectious disease specialist or epidemiologist etc etc so annoyed - people not only thinking it's not that bad a disease, but also thinking it's simply a respiratory/breathing disease, like bronchitis or pneumonia. It's not. It happens to affect the lungs first because that's where the biggest density of ACE-2 receptors are (the sticky out things on our cells that have an important job in normal times, but also happen to be the door that Covid has a key for), but it is a systemic disease.",2020-11-16 14:57:51
juz8ro,"Some good points but lots of assumptions there. I don’t have a car here. I do love the public transport though! I’m sure eventually the true social safety net here will be of use to me, but I won’t have access to public funds for a few years due to being on a visa. I think the pay is abysmal however still prefer to live here, and I would never want to go back to 4 weeks of AL and a sick time bank.  I appreciate how passionately you’ve defended the U.K. though. 😂",2020-11-16 08:56:32
juz8ro,"I believe there is an element of being put on a respirator increasing the risk of negative outcomes independent of it being the case that only the sickest are put on, because the level of sedation needed really isn't good or healthy for any kind of protracted period of time and does/can further depress the system. I have certainly read stories - only anecdotal, though my cousin who was on the Covid team in one of our main hospitals here in my city said that the same thing was playing out in his hospital - of the trigger point/indication for ventilation being changed completely over the course of the pandemic. As in, earlier on they were ventilating people at a much earlier/less severe stage of breathing trouble, akin to the stage they would ventilate them at in other respiratory illness - the kind of ""okay, they're having trouble maintaining oxygen levels even on O2 so we're going to need to ventilate them for a few days to get them over this hump"" stage of breathing difficulty, where they would expect them to be on a ventilator for a few days. Except people weren't recovering. They were on the ventilator for weeks, and then couldn't be weaned off. They didn't know why. So they only started ventilating as an absolute last resort. The ones who were imminently going to die of respiratory failure if they didn't, as opposed to the ones they thought just needed help getting over the worst of it.

So yes, definitely some of it - now, anyway - is just that only the sickest/most likely to die get ventilated in the first place. But they were still seeing more deaths of ventilated people earlier on than they would have expected. So, like everything, it's complicated 😉

I don't know, I could be getting my ""anecdata"" (freely admitted) mixed up; I am a scientist rather than a respiratory physician or anesthesiologist and don't know the detailed nuance of ventilator-related morbidity.",2020-11-16 15:31:28

7k8zl5,"It's like shoveling your own metophoricak 'shit-snow'. When you see it piling up and think...I should clear some of this 'shit-snow' before it gets unmanageable.   But yet, you watch it slowly building up, like a slow mo of ur life's unkept promises.  

Even then, because it's not usually an onslaught or deluge, you're somewhat accepting of the eventuality of it's sheer size and solace in the fact YOU let it happen

And why, Why?!??

Cuz some of us enjoy the show.  The morbidness of the silence that an early morning snowfall brings, let's us remember what 1998 was like...

 Because, it isn't that you don't care, you just might, slightly, somewhere deep in your subconscious know...watching the world burn around you, is gratifying

You never know why the silence and pureness of it all, only makes sense in that moment.  

It's the diametrically opposing reason we alright with it all.   The snow putting out the chaos we premeditated

The bridges we've burned, only light our way home.   It's in the silence of a new snowfall, the eariness of the silence that makes us turn, and reflect...  

Did I pour enough gasoline on that shit!?!   Why's mother nature trying to put out my God damn 🔥?

And that's when you realize you forgot that the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell 

It's only God's will and hell is only a 16ft drop from.the top

Yet Mankind survived

One thing I realized when my grandpa passed and so many people I didn't know had great things to say about him was how hard it was to ""quantify"" the traits .. everyone had distinct experiences of different ranges of traits.

gv1mb0,"My favorite part about the future will be the decline of golf -- and it will be a reflection on the evolution and progress of society.  The hoarding of the land by  fat elites is disgusting. Society will not continue to allow this one small group of people to hoard so much land. 

I've been lucky enough to live right near two golf courses that have closed permanently. It's fascinating how quickly nature takes them back over.

The best part about golf, and golf neighborhoods, is these idiots who buy these mansions or million dollar units on a golf course -- and then the golf course starts to go bust. I love that. 

We're going to put you in the middle of a special field, and we'll give you a stick and some rocks to whack at.

131fjp9,"My impression of the kids from left to right. First 2 kids are partners and the 2nd 2 kids are partners.

• 1st kid looks this is what he always wanted to do in his life.
• 2nd kid is literally Tommy Lee Jones from Men in Black. In reality he just wants to relax and drink his juice, but he knows this is calling, even though he doesn’t really care for it. 
• 3rd kid looks like she’s doing this just because her parents told her she should do it, but she also likes the thrill of it all. She also looks bothered and annoyed by the kid on the right. “Ugh, this is gonna be a long day”
•4th kid - Still a regular kid. Living a happy kid life! Millions of thoughts going through his head. “Is that a squashed bug on your shoe? Eww! Your tall for a girl?! When do we get ice cream? Is over yet? I wonder what my dog is doing at home?” He would have the personality of Ryan Reynolds

This would be a great show or movie 😂",2023-04-29 01:29:43

Seriously, don't call Police Pigs and whatever else and expect a thing out of them.  
They have enough dealing with domestic disputes where the woman calls the police and after they get there the police handle the situation and the woman/wife pulls a knife on an officer or assaults an officer as they drag him off to the cruiser to be taken away.   
That is a COMMON occurrence, the woman/wife decides she just wanted the police to rough him up instead of actually arresting them and when they don't kick his rear in but decide to take him in (after he assaults an officer) the woman/wife loses her mind and goes off. Never mind all the other criminal behavior and crappy attitudes they get thrown at them.  Yeah they decided to become police officers but YOU'RE expected to not break the law.

We end up in court to finalize or whatever. All I knew from TV is that judges were mean and scary and wore black. I was convinced that me and my parents were in trouble and they were going to take my new brother away.😂 I distinctly remember throwing up in the bathroom right outside the courtroom. It was horrible, horrible day. 


In our picture with the judge, my parents are beaming and I was about to cry and looking down. I remember the judge being super nice and trying to help calm me down. I think maybe he invited me up to bang the gavel. I wasn’t hearing none of it.🤣🤦‍♂️",2019-07-14 03:26:29

A good friend of mine is black so it's cool to be able to recommend products to each other. There's a fractionated coconut oil on Amazon that's pretty badass; I know she and her family liked it a lot too if you want the link. I'm still on my first bottle but she said they've gone through like 5 since I sent her the link. 😄",2019-07-13 20:27:53

Your grades get converted to integers (1-7) per unit which are then averaged out throughout your uni life to your GPA.  

7 = high distinction  
6 = distinction  
5 = credit  
4 = pass  
≤3 = fail (3 used to be a conceded pass but it's a fail now too)

axal2s,I've had this for years. I would go to the doctor and she would tell me it's a fungus 😒 but it wasn't until someone mentioned it on Reddit and I looked at the pictures that I finally found out what it was. Went to a new doctor and got some good steroids and I haven't had a flare up in a couple years. ,2019-03-04 22:51:38

axal2s,"Honestly? I do everything I'm not supposed to and I suffer. The compulsion to itch is so strong that I wilfully scald my hands to relieve it.. then it makes the peeling and blistering worse. In between the bouts of insanity, I slather up with corticosteroids and a heavy barrier cream then toss on some gloves overnight. I haven't found any ""triggers"" yet, but know I definitely could use some better resources on how to cope because it seems like different things work for every person I've talked to 😣 I don't want to sound so discouraging, but that's really been my experience with it. What do you do to cope?",2019-03-05 01:25:10

Before her C-Section operation she was told the likelihood of her or me dying in the process was very high so she prayed before going into surgery and told God, “If you let my son survive this I will make sure his name is Christian.” And welp, I’m here now lol. She had me at the age of 17 and wasn’t planning on keeping me until the moment I was born.

5ez00t,"You're not wrong, but that doesn't tell the whole story either. Trump clinched the election by tapping into the fears of so many people (loss of employment, ""culture,"" etc), but he did so on a false premise. 

Immigrants aren't the true threat to unskilled jobs; automation is rapidly absorbing those roles and will only continue to expand with technological progress. Someday we will reach a point where McDonalds cashier or assembly-line shift worker just isn't a job anymore. I think this is an eventuality that we need to accept and plan for, whether it is by pushing trade education for the traditionally unskilled labor base or establishing a standard living ""compensation"" that ALL receive, I don't know. 

The pushback over loss of culture is, while not inherently malignant, xenophobic. Time moves, cultures change. That is progress and will happen whether we like it or not. As with the technological change threatening their jobs, the changing social landscape in America has challenged conservative ""culture"" and adapting to that change is hard. Trump capitalized on that. He promised to return the country to a place where their values are imposed on others and their jobs are recaptured from the immigrants (read: robots) that took them - two things he truly has neither the power or interest to do.

I used to work with a multinational advertising firm. You can guess which one we spent more money on. I'd tell you, but we don't like to make it obvious. :)

Heroin addict for 24 years..

With such a long history of my use, I have found that methadone is really the only way I can manage to stay clean. I tried numerous Rehabs, detoxes, I did the rapid detox, I was incarcerated for 5 years for writing bad checks and used the day I got out. I also was a I.V. Cocaine addict . I haven't used at all in 6 years. I am praying  for you, keep up the great work !!!

6bmgoe,"Haha totally bud! Something about the statement 'coke is a gateway drug... to crack' just makes me lol. I agree with you on every level except the difference between us is a complete 180 on the drugs of choice.  Stimulants never really grabbed me. Perhaps it's just my nature of being a lazy person. But staying up all night? Fuck that! I love my sleep too much. Any day I don't have to work you KNOW I'm sleeping in. Having to lie in bed all night when I can't sleep is my own personal version of pure hell. Obviously that's one (of MANY) reasons downers grabbed me so hard. This of course means coming off them actually leaves you feeling kinda 'wired' in a very not fun way and getting a good nights sleep takes weeks (sometimes months) to achieve after getting clean. Again, for a lazy prick like me - that totally sucks ass and has even been the main reason for a few of my past relapses. When I'd been up for 4 days straight just because I stopped taking drugs and said 'fuck this, I'm getting some gear just to let me finally get some fucking SLEEP!' 😩",2017-05-17 12:56:23

Alcoholism, he believed, involves a spiritual thirst for a sense of wholeness – the true secret of its numinous power and the reason why a person can be led into an addiction. He understood intuitively that only a radical conversion to something equally satisfying to the individual at a deep level can promote recovery.

That is such a great thing to read. It's so good to hear that there are more people like this in our world. I'm sad when i hear news about people being discriminated based on their physical or mental being, that is not what's important. What's important is the person, and how they are. Most people are great just when you get to know them, but it feels like people have forgotten all about how to show one and another respect. And when you write such it fllls my hearth with joy. 

Thank you for making my day!

She’s a very happy lady, and never misses an activity in the home, and likes when my mom visits to take her out for an afternoon even if it’s for a haircuts.

But the President of the United States should not, on live television, feel the need to consult an expert with unjustifiably dumb questions (yes, there are definitely dumb questions if you’re a leader of a world superpower) during a national emergency. 

He didn’t say we should start injecting people with Lysol, but he did need to ask if it was a possibility to do so. He probably saw that Facebook status floating around “why is covid just a problem if hand sanitizer kills it? 🤔🤔🤔” And ran with it. Fine, it’s been twisted. But it’s still demonstrably bad, and frankly, I’m insulted for Dr. Birx, for needing to entertain any part of those questions directed at her.",2020-04-25 00:06:39

The fact is, there is nothing to say, accept the situation for what it is, until things change. We don’t know about the virus enough to know long term effects. A president telling people the truth (as much as I would love it) has shown that people will freak the fuck out.

Before the coronavirus the economy was hitting highs, the unemployment was down for all people, in 2018 alone $700 billion was repatriated, he promoted the first gay ambassador, he hasn’t taken us to war like it was promised he would, he tried to institute a travel ban early in this and Pelosi took to the media and had a movement to go to Chinatown because Trump is xenophobic, and there was an increase in cases right after that move. One week later everyone complained he didn’t do a travel ban early enough. I see so much negative things about him when he has done a wonderful job through all types of negativity and very little support from the people. He is losing money everyday and working around the clock while pelosi sat and ate a freezer full of ice cream.

ycu7z0,"My dad was a coal miner foreman all my life. You would be hard pressed to find people who work harder except maybe iceboat fisherman. They do it because it usually pays well and is the only job available. It's dangerous and it's dirty. That man was much dirtier than he is before he left that mine. Dad always looked like he wore eyeliner and his wallet was full of coal dust. Unfortunately, so were his lungs. 

He retired and was finally doing all the things he wanted. He planted roses, baked cakes, germinated plants, redid old cars. The man made his own sauerkraut. He read 3-4 books a week.

Then he got sick. Silicosis, lung schleroderma, Raynaud's disease all tied up with Black Lung. According to his Dr, he was in perfect health with the heart of a 30yo but his lungs were full of coal dust. 

He was a hard man and was used to work.  He would duct tape his o2 tank to the riding mower and cut all 6 acres of yard. 2 weeks before he died at 70, he taped the tank to his tractor and plowed a garden. With help, he planted everything he could think of. Most productive garden we ever had. Peach trees that hadn't produced jack in my 37 years started bearing fruit and mom got tired of making cobblers.  Mom said she knew that he had flown over that garden and asked God to bless it. ""First thing I'm doing when I get to heaven is whip his ass for giving me all this work to do.""  The peach trees all died the next year. 


These men literally work themselves to death to take care of their families. It's of no surprise to me that this man, who was no doubt absolutely exhausted, made the decision to take his son to that game no matter what. Good job, Dad. 💗",2022-10-25 15:39:50

ycu7z0,"Here is some follow up from the local news :

This is America.
 
Hard working and ever loyal.
A half mile underground, grinding and striving.
Soot on his face and warmth in his heart.
 
I’d like to introduce you to Michael McGuire- husband, father, American.
 
140 miles southeast of Lexington it sits.
Pikeville, Kentucky is coal mining country, seven thousand residents strong, proud and true.

It was last Saturday night when the town folk made their way to Appalachian Wireless Arena.
Coach Calipari and the Wildcats were soon to arrive, as blue collar welcomed Kentucky Blue.
 
It was a year ago, and Pikeville’s Michael McGuire was working as a mail carrier.
His wife Mollie was a dispatcher, together with her husband trying to make ends meet.
Money was tight, as Mollie had just given birth to Lynlee, who joined then 2-year-old brother Easton.
“I need to make more money to support our family”, Michael said. “I’m going underground.”
 
It was three days ago, and Michael’s Saturday shift at Excel Mining was nearing an end.
Tired and dirty and dusty, Michael took a deep breath of fresh air and called his wife.
The Kentucky basketball scrimmage was set to tip off at 6 pm- he had no time to go home and shower.
Michael told his wife that he needed to be at the start of the game- it was Easton’s first-ever Kentucky basketball experience.
 
“I’ll take the kids to the arena and meet you there”, Mollie told her husband.
The plan? Mollie would find the family’s seats and Michael would join them.
“I knew Michael wanted to be at the arena before the tip”, Mollie tells me.
“It was so important for him to be with Easton when the scrimmage began.”
 
Sue Kinneer loves Kentucky basketball- always has, always will.
As she settled into her seat, she noticed a man that stood out from the sea of blue.
“The man was dirty, with soot on his face”, Sue tells me.
“He looked very tired, but he was smiling at his son, and his son was hugging him and climbing on him- they looked so happy.”
 
As Sue snapped a picture of Michael McGuire (top left), she was also snapping a picture of America.
Hard-working and ever loyal.
Soot on his face and warmth in his heart.
Sue posted the picture on social media.
 
It was yesterday when Kentucky Coach John Calipari took notice.
He Tweeted Sue’s picture, saying, “My family’s American dream started in a WV coal mine, so this picture hits home.”
“From what I’ve been told, after his shift he raced to be with his wife and son to watch our team.”
“I have tickets for him and his family at Rupp to be treated as VIP’s!”
 
America had fallen in love with a hard-working husband and father who is providing for his family.
The same father who months before had gathered clothes and household items and delivered them to flood victims.
“He really is the best dad ever”, Mollie says.
 
Michael and Mollie are looking over their calendar as they are deciding on which Wildcats game to attend.
“We are thinking of the Kentucky-Tennessee game, but we are so excited we may not be able to wait that long”, says Mollie with a chuckle.

“Coach Calipari called Michael last night and told him we will be able to meet the players and go to the shoot-around.”
“We are so overwhelmed at the joy that this story has brought to us, and we hope that we have brought joy to others.”
 
And so goes the story of Michael McGuire of Pikeville, Kentucky.
 
A hard-working husband and father with soot on his face and warmth in his heart.
 
The story of blue collar meeting Kentucky Blue.

And a picture that reminds us:
 
This is America. 🇺🇸

Generational poverty, lack of education, and lack of work opportunities in the Appalachian region of the US are staggering. Dopesick (excellent series, IMO) shows how this specific part of the country was targeted for the unconscionable distribution of opioids because they knew folks working in the mines would have chronic pain so they easily got them hooked.

hsug81,"😃As a white male born, raised and living in Mississippi, this thoroughly excites me. Thankful for this. 

I remember the first instances of me wrestling internally with questions like “is this history accurately told to me?”, “is this cause worth celebrating?”, etc.

After years of this self-questioning, there was one decisive moment when I had my own ‘switching of the plates.’ It was when I read an article written by a friend I really respect—A friend with the last name Pickett, a direct descendent of George Pickett (Pickett’s Charge).

This friend, a college professor of history, broke things down rationally and empathetically in a non-threatening way. He too had a ‘switching of the plates’ story; and he ended this article with, “it is time to let it go.”

There are many reasons why they went to war... but as usual wars are declared by politicians 🙄 so countless young men who didn't own slaves and didn't own land fought each other... brothers against brothers. The southerners were duped by rich land owners to fight their wars just as the northern yankees were tricked into war. Basically its a war on control. So yea the south lost and they lost the right to slave ownership however the slaves had no where to go and ended up being ""slaves"" to their former owners even tho they were technically free.

The other had half a handle and a scraggly piece of paper tape on the other side where a handle would go. The metal bit that was half a handle wouldn't hold the door shut. On both stalls you just moved the doors approximately where you wanted them and hoped you didn't fart hard enough that the wind would move the door.

When I asked my manager about the door situation, he said, ""They've always been like that."" and then told me to get to work. I looked up parts online and it would be around $20 to fix both doors.

But seriously, if you look it up the reason American toilet stalls are the way they are is to actually to make you feel uncomfortable and do your business and get out as quickly as possible. Not kidding the short doors/walls are really to make you feel uncomfortable.",2022-09-24 00:54:37

So side story I worked in what we called ""pop up"" vaccine clinics at the end of 2022.  I'm not a doctor, just working administration and orderly duty and stuff so I might get the details wrong but apparently once the medical staff opens a certain number of vaccines they can't be used the next day.  So at the end of the night there would often be extra boosters.  The medical staff budgeted them carefully but it was the dead of winter and a lot of people no showed for their appointments.  

Instead of tossing them the staff would sometimes go around asking us if any of us was due for a booster or if we knew anyone close by who needed one. 

We made a lot of jokes about big pharma and drug pushing 🤣",2023-03-16 00:36:36

l44wf0,"I don't think cost is really the issue. Road trips are generally cheap as long as you don't eat out all the time, especially once you get out the US or Canada. The main issue for me would be responsibilities and security after the trip. The kinds of questions that I'd be thinking of are: Do you have a family to take care of now?

Billions, struggling daily to, feed, house, clothe, educate their children, just to survive on a few $US dollars a week. Striping CO2 sequestering forest, logging, dirt farming, mining with hand tools, and industrial chemicals, no PPE, in living conditions, shortening life expectancy. 

Utopia, stalled in its delivery by psychopaths and sociopaths, Ayn Rand rebranded objectivists. Worshipping, the imaginary ochre faced God of materialism.

The New York Post did report on it, as well as many other smaller media outlets. It was ACTIVELY CENSORED by big tech/media… they also conjoured up a story about how  “50 FORMER intelligence officers” say that it’s all “Russian disinformation”.. 😂 former officers, meaning they have no idea what’s currently going on. 

Do you remember when trump supposedly peed on hookers? Was that not reported on because it was literally made up and there was no proof? Nope, they reported on it… remember Russia Collusion and Schiff saying he has “evidence” that trump was a “Russian asset”? None of that was true or verified and it was front page news for years… remember the Steele Dossier which was saying the POTUS was a traitor? All reported on everyday for years, none of it confirmed or true and now turns out it was all bullshit. But hey, that doesn’t matter, media was just doing its job trying to convince America that orange man bad. 

You have the current (at the time) director of National Intelligence saying that the 50 former intel agents who said it’s “Russian disinformation”,  have no idea what they are talking about  and they have 0 evidence pointing to it being Russian disinformation…. But the media doesn’t care to report on that? 

You have (like so many Americans) been brainwashed. 

This didn’t “fall flat” it was a real story that was actively suppressed and purposefully not covered because there was an election coming up.
Is that not trying to change the outcome of an election? 

It’s pretty easy to “fall flat” when 99% of big tech/media (so painfully obviously) has an agenda.",2021-11-07 17:18:07

Edit: 

Having fake thumbnails and titles on YouTube to get more views is one thing, but having fake titles like this to REAL LIFE situations that need immediate attention is completely unacceptable. 

Edit 2: 

Here’s proof that this boy made it AWAY from the mob and into the safe hands of the crowd

I’m experiencing a lot of hate comments from people who think I’m here to divert everyone from the situation at hand. If my comment lead you to think this, I’m sorry, but I am not trying to change the subject here. 

What’s happening in Bangladesh needs to be recognized by the whole world, and stopped immediately, and I respect OP for raising more awareness 👏

My main argument here is that OP used a misleading title and thumbnail. See the video link posted on edit 2 and you’ll understand why. 

Thank you to everyone who understood my comment’s main point. The goal of this comment is to get OP to see this and hopefully release a statement saying that the kid managed to flee the scene without a “broken” head so that the thousands of people seeing this thread aren’t mislead to believe otherwise.

Originally bought it in 2006 to load with cartoons and kid shows for my 9 year old son and I to watch together when we were flying home from Yokota air Base, Tokyo back to the States.  Had a huge battery pack (""iLuv"", I think) that would keep it running for days.  Battery pack eventually died, and only thing I've noticed is the front face controls aren't as ""clicky"" as they used to be, but still work just fine.  Son is now 21, but I still use it every day for commuting to and from work with audiobooks and podcasts.  😎",2018-06-15 02:02:07

At one point I remember us crying as we couldn’t even get into the tent physically where they were staged (really not ashamed to admit that it was very justified *we got in eventually). Best of all the guys in front of us were topless apart from the ring leader who was wearing a fur hat with long side and seemed to be the gatekeeper of their special snacks lol it was Scotland so probably like max 0 degrees C. Anyhow It was is and will be the most amazing show I have see for all these reasons lol. Thanks for the link 👍

I lost my boy 6 weeks ago and it was the best decision for him but the hardest for me. He went to sleep in my arms with me telling him how loved he was. I miss him like a constant ache. Cherish every minute and know that however much you love him, he loves you tenfold.

h8gej1,"I participated in the first wave of protests in Dallas recently but had to stop because it became to dangerous and out of hand to some extent. 

What I did notice was black and white people coming together and not being shitty to each other. It was one of the most empowering moments of my life and changed my whole outlook on the reality of racism. 

Unfortunately, what I've witnessed in other years of my life is tons of racism towards black people. It's FACT!!!! No, I was not a part of it but I still see it and in the past I even found myself trying to make justifications for cop brutality in some cases by thinking things like well the person was doing something bad etc etc. 

I finally realized one day years ago that's not ok. I dont care what someone did or supposedly did you don't deserve to die like that. You can literally go out as a black person and die that day for no more of a reason than you're black.

Change is coming!!!!!! 😁❤️",2020-06-13 23:59:43

See you are equating BLM to others to not matter as much when thats not what it means.

It means black lives should matter just as much as any other life yet unfortunately its been proven that isnt the truth and thats what we need to change and make sure that there is equality and that all lives do matter. 

So even though you are technically correct and thats what we all want, you are being ignorant to the fact that right now that isnt the truth by saying that.",2020-06-14 04:07:15

Also, you have the _classic_ , old school film star looks (like Jim Caviezel has, for instance), which is also very refreshing to see. And of course, your acting chops has been validated by that rolling stone review! You've arrived!

May I offer the most sincere congratulations on this achievement! I hope that you go far and achieve all you want, in your field!

I work in live theatre (bts) and there are actors I know that have been expensively trained at prestigious programs trying to find “that thing” that makes acting believable and therefore powerful, relatable. They’re amazing at it and can perform most characters very well, but sometimes it’s just not “it”. You seem to be naturally able to inhabit the mind and world of the character in a way that makes your acting something different. I say if you’ve never acted before and you’re delivering /that/, don’t learn how to act. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Congrats, and great job, man. ",2018-10-12 00:26:44

Back where I used to live, a building next to my dad's work place (couple blocks down) had a few floors under construction if I remember correctly. Some dumbasses lit fireworks next to it and one of them went right into one of the construction floors. There must have been flammable paint or plastic sheeting or some crap because it went up fast. Burned the entire building down, some 6 or more stories.

Edit: fuck me it's worse than I remember. It was the Chinese cultural center. Not only an important government building, but a **44** story building. And the cherry on top is that the dumbasses responsible were the cctv department next door that caused the tvcc fire 😂.

oe3sz9,"I totally understand where your coming from, and let me say I appreciate such a well thought out answer and reply. 

They do definitely the effects listed above, but that arguement could be made about many things, I just do not agree a total ban on fireworks is appropriate or even needed. With the correct legislation, laws and appropriate punishments you can have fireworks  which are safer and have a lower noise level for personal useage and appropriately staffed events for the bigger variety, I just feel that if we can seek the middle ground and look for the compromise then everybody benefits! 

For example, and again I hate using this but it was where my original comment started, is that alot of your examples can be applied to dogs, the dog food industry will have more of an ecological impact and not to mention feral dogs that plague some proper nations of the world. We also have people that are terrified of dogs and I'd you were to ask their opinion it may be that they feel strongly that dog ownership should be banned, even more so if they happen to work in the firework industry 😂 

Undoubtedly dog ownership should be tightened as well, mainly just to prevent poor dogs being owned by people that have no right for them, and again this is the middle ground that makes sense.",2021-07-05 15:46:22

Maybe all those buttons are designed to have no give. Idk some function simply by touch or pressure.

The way of our society is so opposite of community, that it seems a severely uphill battle. ☹️ This kind of thing is really not the fault of individual parents, it's institutional!

Alcohol is a drug. You are an addict if you can't live without it. Because we have been desensitized to it and commercials make it soooo ""fun"". We don't look at it like it's cocaine or heroin or crack. But it is. The same thing. A drug!
If you can enjoy it quietly and peacefully, at home or out somewhere, cool. But it should not be looked at in such a jovial, haha look at me I almost overdosed (alcohol poisoning/blacking out is an overdose) light hearted way. It is a drug and it is some serious shit. 
Really surprised they haven't made ads disappear by now like they did for cigarettes.

dduqhl,"Thank you. 
Too much though kid. He had too much. What if he didn't make it to the toilet and vomited while laying on his back in bed, wasn't able to turn over and aspirated on it. Then he dead. Many people went out that way. I think Jimi Hendrix was one. Don't qoute me on it though. I gotta check.
Exactly what you said is the problem with the view of alcohol.
""O well we just went out last night and got wasted haha, I lost my phone and wallet and my friend almost died when he threw up on the torlet for soooo long, it was soo funny.""How much did you guys drink? ""O we didn't drink at all, we were coked up and poppin some percocet and xanax.
Bro, think about that. Doesn't it seem scummier when alcohol isnt the DOC. 
But alcohol causes the exact same, plus worse, scenarios all the damn time. But we just write it off as "" hey hey hey, they just got drunk haha"". Drugs are drugs and all of them can cause terrible experiences. Alcohol and caffeine should be used with care and respect too. Because, well,  they are an addictive, easily abused substance also.🙋",2019-10-06 02:53:49

rmx5wk,"This movie should have been called ""The CW presents Tommy Wisseau's The Matrix: A Star Wars Tale"" 

The original Matrix sequels are to George W Bush as the Matrix 4 is to Trump. I never thought I'd look back wistfully on the earlier sequels, but here I am. 

The main plot points are good, but I hated the execution. Hated. 

The first 30 minutes is a 4th wall-breaking discussion about the original Matrix trilogy 🤷‍♂️

Then there's a Matrix Parody section.

Then there's the lifetime movie section.

And then there's a part at the end that feels like it's the Matrix. 

Usually, when a movie fails, it fails in one or two key ways. This movie fails spectacularly in every way. It was actually still kind of interesting to watch, because it invented new ways of sucking that I didn't expect.

The cinematography was straight up from the 90s. The music choices were odd. The dialogue was a cross between extremely heavy-handed social commentary and dumbness.

Neo fights the lost boys from Hook.

There are friendly pet robots, like BB8.

That 90s low-frame effect that they used when slowmo cameras didn't exist gets used in almost every action scene.

Every character is gay. Not an exaggeration. Humans, programs, characters whose names you don't even know. To the point where you have to wonder how the human race is being repopulated. Neo and Trinity are they only straight characters.

So yeah, I still recommend everyone watch it. But it's a hilariously bad trainwreck of a movie. I went in with low expectations, but damn, I was still floored.",2021-12-23 18:13:44

Thankfully I’m healthy at the moment, but if I happen to be an asymptomatic carrier, I could never forgive myself for passing it on to her or the rest of my family. 

For now, we’re all keeping our distance from her, calling her daily and dropping off groceries from a safe distance. She lives in the countryside so my aunt will join her for walks while keeping her 6 feet away. This virus is no joke and i just want her to be well 😥",2020-03-28 19:31:11

Kept ranting on how we should all go out for lunch a week ago.... Until her church closed for the duration.  Still thinks my dad's being an agoraphobic dramatic ass though.  Like dude.  He's got advanced MS.  You're almost 90 and have severe asthma. Omg.  Because were being ""so unreasonable"" she legit sent the random face masks she found in her house to us.  🤦",2020-03-28 20:20:27
fqldp4,"Every 8 days? You can do better. Also see if the businesses in your area deliver food. Target does for one and that’s how I get my perishables. Everything else you can buy and stock up on for at least a month easily. I haven’t left the house in 17 days. I’m also very healthy in my late 20’s. It’s not my health that I’m worried about (although anyone in their 20s and 30s is NOT invincible and that way of thinking is sad and devastating..), but the health of any elderly people that I could come into contact with if I somehow did contract the virus and didn’t realize it. 

I read a story recently about a woman who came back from spring break and gave it to her mother and her mother died. This is the exact type of situation I want to avoid. I don’t want to kill ANYONE’s mother because of my actions. Please think people. ANY of us could have this RIGHT NOW, and not even realize it. Think ‘Typhoid Mary’, if you don’t know who she is look her up. Sad story no matter which way you spin it. Stay safe everyone. 🙏",2020-03-28 19:01:12

The couple who appeared in their 20s at the store with a tiny baby, not wearing masks or gloves and pushing their baby in the baby seat of the cart? Those ones I don’t understand.

ir2q84,"Here's the real problem with that. Our country has created a NEED for you to commute to work for our Faberge egg of an economy. 

Picture the typical American Monday.

I get in my Ford™ fusion that I couldn't actually afford so I have to pay off my 2.5% APR loan to Wells Fargo™ and start driving, hoping that if anything happens on my commute,  Allstate™ will not reject my claim 

Since I have an hour and a half commute and get worked ragged everyday I stop at a combo Exxon/McDonald's™ so I can run in and get a Mcgriddle© while my car fills up with gas. 

I go in to the office and make my company exponentially more money than they pay me, just happy they feed me just enough scraps to survive. 

Since I didn't have much time in the morning to fix a lunch when my 25 minute lunch break comes around I go To Burger King ™ and get a Whopper © for lunch since even if I had enough time to actually eat some real food I don't have enough money to. 

Since I'm unmarried, tired and hungry by 5pm when I get off I stop at a seven eleven ™ to get a snack, so I can make it home to pay my landlord and not actually progress towards any type of value being added to my life but instead spending all I have to spin my wheels in the mud and just barely stay afloat.

If you think we ended up here by accident and that this isn't all working as intended you should take a step back and look at your own lives and how much this virus has shown us that it's not us that need to live this way, it's them that need us to",2020-09-12 14:22:07

9szewa,"In high school, I had a friend who's dad became paralyzed from the neck down. He was playing catch while on a balcony with a child who was below on the ground. Reached for the ball and fell about 15 feet landing on his head/neck. His wife ended up leaving him, because she couldn't stand being a caretaker anymore. While I don't know the whole situation or all of their circumstances, I never understood how someone could do this to their spouse. I guess what I came to say is, you have a good heart and you guys are  fortunate to have found that kind of love. The kind of love that truly defines the word. Cheers to you both, and awesome costume😁",2018-10-31 18:22:59
9szewa,"I was in a rehab hospital and my roommate had a severe brain injury. She barely recognized people and she would often lash out and hit or kick people for coming too close. 

After lots of hard work I watched her get to get better, going from a wheel chair to a cane to walking again. She started to remember more and talk better again too. We cried tears of joy when she announced she did the stairs and I cried again when she got up and ran into her mothers arms and left that day. 

She was a senior in high school and was told she would not be able to finish or if she did it would be very limited what she could do in school. Her mom and friends stood by her, brought her school work for the rest of the year to her house, and at the end of the year she walked across the stage with everyone else. 

Standing by people is what’s important. It encourages them to do what they thought wouldn’t be possible if they were alone. I hope your wife is well and my thoughts are with you and your family❤️",2018-10-31 19:41:01

I’m also so sorry you’re going through this.  I hope you take my mother’s recovery story as an inspiration.   I’m going to repost a previous comment I made to someone else:

Chemo brain really does improve with time.  The brain repairs itself - the memories are there, it’s just that access to them has temporarily been blocked.   *You’re still there*.

Mom never thought she’d walk again or be able to form a proper sentence.  Now she has full mobility and is back to being better at crosswords than me.

Stay strong, friend. 🌸",2018-10-31 18:04:29
9szewa,"Piece of advice:

Chemotherapy is suspected to cause vitamin B12 deficiency in quite some patients and vitamin B12 deficiency can cause those neurological problems too.

I'm not saying it's all from a chemo induced vitamin B12 deficiency but it is worth looking into. And supplementing it with either tablets (which might not work well because your gut is probably still recovering too) or injections never hurt anyone. With a 1 mg injection every 3 days it's quite literally impossible to overdose. And overdoses aren't really damaging either. Any excess will be peed out in a short time.

I had those problems without chemo. I just suck at absorbing it at all so I had a deficiency.

It also helps with the always being tired and cold. My grandma improved loads when she started injections after chemo.

And the university hospital in my city is actually looking into the effects of giving an injection with every dose of chemo.

I just hope you have a speedy recovery ♥. ",2018-10-31 20:30:31

b0hqej,"Yes! I’ve had a ton of stupid questions/comments. Not in any particular order, but...

1) “You’re allowed to drive? What the fuck” 

Uh, yeah, I passed my license test?

2) “You’re really pretty/smart/cool/*insert pretty much any adjective here* for a D/deaf person...” 

First of all, what am I supposed to say? Thanks? Secondly, I’m just a normal person who happens to not be able to hear, don’t treat me as I’m some kind of oddity. This is NOT a compliment.

3) “You don’t *look* D/deaf” 

See above.

4) “You’re D/deaf and you got into college?!” 

Again, I’m just a normal person and yes, I’m smart enough to go to college. Fuck off

5) “So..uh....how do D/deaf people have sex?” 

Yeah, maybe this one isn’t as stupid as others but just plain weird to ask someone five minutes after meeting them. But I can confirm we have sex like everybody else 😂

6) “You have a cochlear implant, so that means you’re cured, right? You’re not Deaf anymore?” 

No. I’m still very much Deaf, not only culturally, but physically as well. The cochlear implant is *NOT* a cure, nor do I need a “cure”.

7) “Oh! You’re Deaf! You know Braille, right?”

Wrong disability 😂


Edit: Didn’t mean to turn this into a rant, but yes, I’ve gotten a lot of dumb comments/questions from people. But I’ve also gotten a lot of thought-provoking, sincere, and real questions from people who truly want to learn and understand. Those people overshadow the stupid ones by far. I don’t mind people asking questions and I’ll even encourage you to ask anyways if the question is stupid because at the end of the day, at least they’re learning, right?",2019-03-13 09:34:58

They may not be able to fix, but the can give an example they can be the example  they are supposed to be leaders, and leaders should lead everyone independently of their race, sex orientation, religion or stereotypes. 

What's is happening in America is the old far West gun sligin culture, which was semi dormant untill now. 
People are scared, there is an economical crysis and the is no social oriented culture.

So everyone for themselfs... It's wrong, too many states with too much independence. 

A good example (might not be perfect) is Portugal 🇵🇹 where they went full on social.

djwkpi,I'm pretty sure she didn't either. 🤷,2019-10-19 04:36:11
djwkpi,"> I see so many people willing to support Hong Kong, but will never do anything about the problems in their own country.

Because it's easier to wear a ""Stand with Hong Kong"" shirt and make memes than it is to actually do something to promote change. None of these people are about shit. Social media activists 😂😂",2019-10-19 04:42:28
djwkpi,Or she's a just genuine racist and nazi sympathizer 🤷‍♂️,2019-10-19 05:54:30
djwkpi,"Well 

A) she’s a heckler, calling a player a pussy ass bitch because he lost a basketball game to a team she arbitrarily supports. So she deserves to be condescended to at least a little bit, because this isn’t a political statement. It happened several years ago

B) I think it’s jumping through some hoops to see it as badass at all. I hate LeBron as much as anyone, but the way she says that reeks of “whoops, wasn’t expecting to get called out, sorry can’t hear you 😬” *scurries away*. Yknow, like every heckler ever when they get exposed",2019-10-19 04:29:34

simb49,lol 😂,2022-02-02 12:05:27
simb49,I love reading NFT meme comment sections because it’s just a bunch of assholes mocking something they don’t understand and aren’t a part of 😂😂 if it makes you money it can’t be that stupid now can it? Also if you don’t understand it or don’t want any part of it that’s no reason to mock it 😂 it’s enjoyment and a hobby for some of us. Classic toxic people though shitting on something others enjoy because they don’t comprehend it or don’t agree with it. Get a life lol,2022-02-02 18:12:09

🔥💨🔥Launching on 4/20🔥💨🔥

🚨ONLY 50 WHITELISTS LEFT🚨

420 Buds Club is a 4200 piece NFT collection to be released to the Ethereum blockchain.
The dev and team are giving out 100 whitelists to the first 100 people to join the discord server. This will give you access to the whitelist mint and you will have a chance to buy before the public sale. After the first 100 whitelists are given away you will have to grind to earn whitelists and OG Dealer roles. Dev has big plans for marketing so take advantage of this early pre marketing opportunity.

simb49,"honestly iconic memes like this i understand being NFT’d and having it confirmed the original in the blockchain. this meme is ancient, has been around the web, and IMO can appreciate as one of those things that signifies and time and place in humanity. to have what is officially marked as the original of this can definitely be of value to a collector. this i can consider art of the digital age. 


now those monkey pictures that people keep buying…🤔🤯",2022-02-02 17:31:47

simb49,"The amazing thing is they'd sell you a Southern Hemisphere star, barely even visible in a high power telescope in perfectly dark conditions, **and** you lived in Ohio or California or England where you'd never see it at all because it'd be well below the horizon all year long. 

Guess someone in Perth or Sydney can enjoy ""your"" star, if they have a 10"" scope and a very dark backyard 🤣",2022-02-02 19:47:56

simb49,"Disaster Girl (Zoe Roth)

>This iconic picture was captured in 2004 by Zoe Roth’s father, Dave Roth when she was observing firefighters controlling the blaze two blocks away from their house in North Carolina. In 2007, Dave entered this photo into a competition and surprisingly, won it. The rest, as they say is history. Now, she’s living away from the internet with her family and friends. her  insta @ zoeroth

According to it her father Dave Roth should own it. And the money should ho to his hands. Who knows who took the money. Who is controlling the laws of random internet stuff. Can he go and sue them. People expert in this discipline come forward and comment.

I am going to buy all pics from this list. 😅
