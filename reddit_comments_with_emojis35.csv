o8v2mm,"Trump Tower Greenland would have projected a much brighter version of the northern lights. They’d be visible from sundown to sun up. It would have projected a version of the entire night sky. Constellations were to be accentuated. The planets would have appeared larger, with the rings of Saturn being clearly visible to guests of the hotel. While the grounds of the resort would have the best vantage point to see the spectacle, nearby neighbors would also be able to enjoy the residual light, and a somewhat warped view of the “heavens,” from sundown to sun up. 

Not everyone would have enjoyed the brighter night sky, but the argument was made that the projection would have made it much safer on the streets. It would essentially have negated the need for street lights for several square miles.

Now when I look at the Northern Lights (naturally occurring), I can’t help but wonder how much more fantastic the Trump Sky would have been.🤷‍♀️",2021-06-27 15:32:55

- my mother cannot drive
- my mother does not know when to be quiet 
- my uncle owned a rival taxi rank company before he died

So now whenever I get a taxi from university, every driver knows my name/disability/what I study/where I live. Because my mother has told them. And she takes taxis so often they all bloody know and remember. If they want to add a bit of variety they talk about my uncle’s rival company and how shit it is. It’s excruciating because I find it really invasive and intrusive, and I don’t know what my mother’s told them — one time she lied to a driver to say I had a boyfriend (I don’t) and I confused the guy when I was like ‘...? What’ when he asked about my boyfriend.",2019-07-18 10:29:28

I can't say that I've experienced the same you have. But I've also hit an all time low almost two years ago. I got kicked out of school, mental illnesses going out of control and have no goals or desires in life. 

But it got better. I'm back in school pursuing a major that I enjoy. I'm advancing my professional career by interning, it took me hundreds of applications to land an internship but it was worth it. The next two years, and my future, look a lot brighter than before. 

All I'm trying to say, it'll get better. Just hang in there and don't be afraid to rely on family and close friends.

Good luck! ♥️

I have really dark ways of showing my disapproval. I have adhd, which means I'll win. You can't out last me. So when my neighbors think it's okay to let their dogs bark all day long. I, being a night owl, played my music just loud enough not to get a ticket. Malevolence. I will do shit to annoy the piss outta you all while not breaking any laws or rules.

Then she counts out the amount for the check again and places that in the envelope. I get my sealed envelope and I leave. When I get home I realize what has happened but the bank has no way to contact me and I did nothing wrong. Looking back on it, the teller probably lost their job over that mistake and I feel bad.

In the operating room he stepped in with his clipboard and began the verification process where they rattle off ""okay we're here with Jane Smith, for This Surgery, at This Time"" ect ect. He started but stopped and flat out said ""well I can't see crap, this is no good"" I laughed and told the nurse ""that's what you wanna hear before someone cuts you open!""

I told him why I was laughing like a crazy person. “You’re like Oedipus, running from one right into the arms of another.”  He looked at me straight faced and said “I get in trouble if I burn the coffee, though.”  Scream laugh from me.

I’ll take my pronamel and continue my run of negligible canker sores for the rest of my life, plus Fluoride Rules. 

STEVE HOLT

e: Okay so a few things. The SLS in this preparation doesn’t seem to have the same harsh properties as the Sulfate derivative, however [looking at this list](http://www.mouthulcers.org/toothpaste-ingredients-to-avoid) still gives me some pause in using an irritant of any kind to risk.

I’ve spent so many years of my life suffering from mouth ulcers that having found a toothpaste that works, I don’t want to switch off. 

And as an addendum, **most** of the sensodyne preparations still have the **bad** SLS, it seems they have removed it only from the Pronamel, which is a bummer as I was excited to use the “Repair” toothpaste but ended up getting severe canker sores within a week of using it 😕",2017-11-14 16:43:23
7cwav7,"Yeah they are.. And they are ripping off like minded (misinformed/ ignorant) people. Essentially charging a premium for meaningless labels, surprisingly common practice (because it works unfortunately). If you look closely you can see the brand name.

To start, no fluoride, and it's something they boast. 🤦‍♂️owner doesn't approve of it..

Not a surprise from a company who says this proudly: ""We have gone on record as stating that we would cease trading rather than comply with any compulsory testing regulations."" yep... 

Other things they claim, gluten free.. Just like every other toothpaste ever? Also FYI, unless you have celiac disease, there is no benefit in being gluten free.

They also claim GMO free. Another meaningless claim. Same as every other toothpaste ever again; calcium carbonate and glycerine doesn't have a genome does it.. And really, all those plants they get those 'all natural' ingredients from, 100% selectively bred aka selectively breeding for the traits, hence genes you desire, which is genetic modification (one of the many methods of it). And also once again, nothing actually wrong with GMOs, in fact we would be rather screwed without them.

They of course claim 'all natural', another meaningless claim. Everything is 'natural'; bleach is natural, arsenic is naturally occurring, you can refine cyanide from apples etc. And once again it doesn't actually matter where the molecules were sourced, if it has the same atomic structure, it's the same thing! H2O is still water whether you synthesised it from rocket fuel or got it from a natural glacier. And actually it's the synthesised compounds which are usually purer than the naturally sourced ones.

Another claim, can't see on the picture but I can almost guarantee they make is the benefits of the activated charcoal in there. First of all there are most likely trace amounts in there, notice how it's the least used ingredient apart from the flavouring. It is also only functioning as an abrasive, not what activated charcoal is used for normally.. And the job of an abrasive is already being done by the calcium carbonate, which is roughly 50% of the toothpaste. Activated charcoal is traditionally used as a filter, the large surface area on the crystal structure makes it good at 'catching' impurities and organic compounds. However in this use, it isn't doing anything ; any dirt from your teeth is suspended in the toothpaste and foam and washed away. It's not going to whiten your teeth; a toothpaste with sodium hydroxide would probably be much better. Yep, useless ingredient they will charge you more fore.

Nothing antibacterial in there either.

They also claim to be vegan and halal and kosher. Meaningless in relation to toothpaste. May as well chuck microwaveable on there.

Oh and those compulsory testing regulations they refuse to comply with? Yeah those tests that are for consumer health and safety? They refuse to do that because of the animals.. Because brushing a purposefully bred lab rat's teeth is so cruel, it's worth risking peoples lives over.. Fortunately for us toothpaste is like 3 essential ingredients, hard to fuck up. But still I'd be sceptical of their quality control, from a company like this; not unheard of for bacteria and such to sneak into what should be a safe product, even from reputable companies. No idea about the legal side of it, one would think compulsory tests were unavoidable. Probably a classification loophole.",2017-11-14 18:37:01

ebomu9,"Hahahha oh lord you’re hilarious. I’ve been at work, kid, I’m a grown up. 

Lemme be real for a second. You and I (and anyone that can read) can see that you’re just a young gamer kid. And it’s also pretty obvious that you don’t really know how Reddit works. According to your comments, you spend a great deal of time on Reddit running your troll mouth. I’m a grown ass woman who posted a picture of my floor that made Top Post, and you’re just a jealous little brat that had to leave a snarky comment like a troll. Also according to both you and i’s comment history, there’s only one of maybe two ways this could have gone down.  

Either you intended on asking if I wanna get raped because you’re still trolling me, or you accidentally confused my comment with a conversation you were with having with others on  your comment line. The latter would have been acceptable if you had just owned up to it like a man, but unfortunately you are not a man, and the rest of the world isn’t isn’t as dumb as you think they are. 

You see, you picked the wrong lady to fuck with. I’m a rape survivor, and when you said that shit to me I decided to give you a chance to own up like a man and apologize. When you doubled down on your childish projection/ gaslighting bullshit,  I decided then and there that I was going to let the internet destroy you. 

I went to your comment history and told everyone what a stupid little troll you are, and it fucking shook you so bad, you went full Trump mode spouting shit like “ugly girls can’t get raped” and started some crazy conspiracy about me being able to control Reddit and take comments from other threads and photoshop them onto mine, and being able to cover up mod deletions and shit 😂

You’re comments on my posts are all the evidence I need. You’ve contradicted yourself so many times here and proved yourself a liar and a troll. You must think everyone online is an idiot. 

Don’t worry, I be posting this on the other threads all over the place. I’m even firing up my old Twitter account. I especially want people to see your lovely rant about how ugly girls can’t get raped and how I’m a cunt and a liar, that’s fucking incel gold. 

I hope you get to be internet famous too, just like you wanted. “Nice guy” of the week. How does that sound? Oh that’s right, I don’t give a fuck what you think cuz I’m doing it anyways. 

Oh by the way, did you ever figure out how to use that reverse imaging?",2019-12-20 01:14:23

The amount of cringe is impressive. It makes me think that you in fact are not""in the market"" for a car, especially when paired with the rest of your post. Most people have an idea of what they want/need and you're here asking if this is a good sedan just because of a picture on Reddit. 🙄",2021-09-02 09:09:27

I am the cat, n here i sit

upon the drafty sill...

my favorite spot - a *purrfect* fit,

as i hold very still....

there's much to see out in the yard,

but as i feel the cold

i'm shivering...is getting hard

the *stealth mode pose* to hold...

i curl my tail - a pillow form

n gently sit on top

n now my paws are nice n warm,

the shivering i stop

with Every step i figure out -

(tho this one seems quite small)

the End of 'human rule', no doubt -

I'll *dominate* 

them All...

dl6rf2,"Buying. A TV and a PlayStation. Or was it an Xbox? Doesn't matter, a console of some kind.

The story ~ 

This was right out of high school, he had just moved out of his parents house and into his dorm at college. His roommates boyfriend was a sketchy dude. (Gay couple if it matters, the roommate is a really nice guy and the boyfriend ended up being an abusive, manipulative asshole so we're all happy he's gone. The then-roomate was a groomsman at his wedding about a year ago, so needless to say they're on good terms.) The boyfriend came in one night, and left with the console and TV. I think he got help from one of his equally-as-sketchy friends on campus. Roommate had no idea, turns out BF stole and copied a key, and in casual conversation, mentions that my idiot friend got stuff stolen from him at night. ""What kind of stuff?"" ""*this and this*"" ""I can sell him a *that* and *that* cheap, let me call someone.""

He ended up buying his own stuff back, took him a solid week to put two and two together, and the boyfriend ended up arrested a few months later and I believe is still in jail for a DUI.

Edit- oh shit gold, I think I'm gonna go stalk my friends Reddit page tomorrow and give him shinies on the most random stuff 😂 I love this site. Also, his wife has enough common sense to make up for his dumbassery. She's gonna find this hilarious.",2019-10-22 02:28:26

♥️🇯🇵

They provide life saving treatment to them with zinc and a zinc ionophore so they are less likely to get severely ill, and they don’t force experimental prophylactic gene therapies onto their people like the tyrannical governments.

And they take care of people who are I’ll or in quarantine by providing food for them.

Instead of forcing them to go back to work like the CDC does here in the US… reducing quarantine to 5 days.

>“We are really taking that leap [to drive innovation] – us as a company, Bayer – in cell and gene therapies … ultimately the mRNA vaccines are an example for that cell and gene therapy. I always like to say: if we had surveyed two years ago in the public – ‘would you be willing to take a gene or cell therapy and inject it into your body?’ – we probably would have had a 95% refusal rate,” stated Oelrich.

The feds, state, and local governments have completely abandoned people with respect to mask guidance. People should wear N95 now, not a thin piece of cloth or a flimsy napkin.

a4b6zx,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Crab Rave. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the Crabs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation- their personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Crab Rave memes  truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the Crab‘s existential catchphrase ""🦀 OBAMA IS GONE 🦀,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Eoin Marc O’ Broins genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Crab tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2018-12-08 17:41:02

x5m2ye,I found out when I was older that I had a twin but my mom had a miscarriage at about 4 1/2 months pregnant. She rushed to the hospital thinking she had a miscarriage with me. But when she arrived  they said she did have a miscarriage but the other baby is fine. She obviously was extremely shocked as she did not know she was pregnant with twins. I was fine but my brother or sister was not. Honestly I felt weird my entire life like something was missing and I know that sounds weird. When my mom told me when I was older I kind of made more sense to me because I know how twins have this weird connection. Who knows maybe that’s why I’ve felt weird all these years? 🤷🏻‍♂️,2022-09-04 14:51:17
x5m2ye,"In my opinion, I would be honest with her about it from the very beginning. I didn’t learn until I was nearly an adult that there was another baby developing that “disappeared” early in my mom’s pregnancy with me and it felt very odd to learn that. My father has since passed and my mom has been very sick for a *while* so it’s impossible for me to get more information about it, though I want to. It’s a bit weird because I had an older brother before me that my mom lost and I always knew about him. 


If she always knows, it may just be normal for her. Maybe on her birthdays or something you can add another candle to the cake or something for her sister? And use that as a reason to explain to her what happened (in age appropriate terms)? Maybe just simply telling her she had a sister in “mommy’s belly” that isn’t here anymore from the start might prepare her for a lifetime of knowing? Every family and child is different of course, so do whatever is best for yours! I’m just throwing out thoughts tbh.


Also, I’m so sorry about what happened to your daughter, that sounds incredibly difficult in many ways (especially if you’re in certain states the US..). I hope you have a very healthy and happy pregnancy and birth💕",2022-09-04 16:51:03

x5m2ye,"Not a parent but I’ve lived some things and met many many people. I’ve had underclassmen latch onto me as a safe older person to talk to and I’ve held people while they learned someone they loved died. 

I think it’s always gonna feel like you’re fucking it up to some extent. Grief is a messy beast and from what I’ve seen, it never really leaves. It just gets easier to deal with. It sounds like you love your kids to pieces. 

Even if right now things are messy and hard, just keep loving them no matter where they are and doing your best. 

I struggled against my mom for a long time. And it was only a couple years after I started college that I realized that I was kind of a shitty kid sometimes, and that my mom did her damned best and I didn’t need anything more. It’s not perfect, I don’t agree with some of her decisions. But I can recognize she did her best and that I love her for it. 

Hope this helps, I’m sorry if it doesn’t.

x5m2ye,"My grandma was a twin born in 1931 (and a Gemini to boot! Aka “the twin” sign).

We suspect she was born via superfetation. Aka, her mother was pregnant with her twin brother but continued to ovulate, so she was conceived later and she was developmentally a month or two behind her brother as a fetus. Ofc they were born on the same day, and he was full-size while she was teeny tiny.

They were born in a rural, wooded cabin area, and because they didn’t have access to anything resembling modern medicine, she had to be swaddled and kept in a low heat oven to keep her warm (no incubator).

She just passed this spring  just before her 91st bday. Had a beautiful marriage that lasted 71 years before my gpa died of covid.

a50tmx,"Very interesting ... I always wondered how this worked. And now I know why no one knows how this works by memory!

Koreans have a similar yet much more elegant system. There’s unit called “chon (촌)” which counts how far you are from a relative. 

Calculation is simple. You and your spouse have 0-chon distance. You and your child have 1-chon distance (similarly, you and your parent have 1-chon distance). That’s IT.

So you and your sibling (brother/sister) is a 2-chon distance because you’re related through your parents (you, up to your parent, then back down to their other child, AKA your sibling). Your uncle and aunts are 3, because sibling (your parent and them) plus one (your parent and you).  Following the same logic, your (first) cousins would be 4-chons. So easy to figure things out!

Korea is a very homogenous society where all of the lineage started from a relatively small group of people. So while many people would be distance blood relatives, Korean law limits the relative distance at 8-chons. 

Now you know how to figure out how far or closely related you are to somebody so you know whom to ignore without guilt at many family gatherings this holiday season! 😉",2018-12-11 02:14:24

mmbi0z,"I work in veterinary medicine. It’s never easy, watching them grow older. Let them live their best life with you and after they are gone, mourn as much as you need. In the end, remember that you loved them for a reason- and a new pet can and will give you a new reason. It’s beautiful really, that we can continually open our hearts. Pets do that for us- open us to love, show us how to do it, and then leave so we can do it again. 💕 Much love to you and your girl.",2021-04-08 02:01:28

11gugs0,"When I grew up I used to visit my grandparents in a town about a couple of hours away. The passed away in the 90s. About 20 years later I was in that town and wanted to visit their old house. I pulled up outside and took a quick pic to send to my sister. I then walked down to the local park I used to play at. 

When I came back to the car, the owner came out and asked why I was taking pictures of their house. I explained and they straight away asked "" are you 'insert dad's name'"". I said no but that's my dad. They said I should come in. So I got to go in the house which was crazy, so many memories. They were redecorating. They stripped the wall paper. Written on the wall was a poem by my dad, signed and dated in the 50s. Then lots of measurements. My dad, when he was a kid, helped my grandad redecorate and then had written stuff on the walls for whoever redecorates in the future. That person in the future they were writing to was me. So many variables as to me seeing that text. 

I told my dad about the story afterwards and he didn't care at all. 😆",2023-03-03 09:40:08
11gugs0,"I had a similar experience. I noticed a car parked out front of my house when I was pulling back up from a quick trip, and when I slowly crept by I noticed they were taking pictures.

I hopped out of the car fast and before I could get the words “what the hell are you doing?” out… noticed it was an extremely old couple. 

They told me that they used to live there and the house actually used to be a set of apartments back in the early 1940s, with the downstairs and upstairs being separate units, yet with a shared kitchen. Was mildly interesting for sure 😂",2023-03-03 07:59:35

11gugs0,"I lived in my childhood home until I was 19, I loved and adored that house. The young couple that bought it also loved it and had no plans to change it. This was in 2006, they were very nice people. I moved out of state but every time I’d visit my hometown I’d drive by hoping to see them outside. It finally happened last fall. My dad and I spoke to him for about 10 minutes from the car in the middle of the street and then it happened. He invited us in. They walked us through the entire house but not before having a little chit chat in the living room and I burst into tears. They really didn’t change anything except some paint colors. There were two tables that belonged to my family that they kept. One was in our garage and now they have it as their dining room table. The memories just swept over me. I was so grateful to be IN my childhood home and to just take it all in after not being inside for 15+ years. It was an amazing and wonderful experience and I hope you are able to do the same for this person if it is the right choice for you ❤️",2023-03-03 18:26:08

It's the cutest story about a young girl, named after me, and her adventures with Winnie-the-Pooh, her loving friend/bear lol. When I went to see her last, I brought the book. When I sat down beside her and began to read the book with her, she transformed right before my eyes! She sat up on her own, opened her eyes wide, and grabbed my hand! She can hardly speak, but she motions for me to lean in closer to her, gives me a kiss on the cheek, and says ""I love you""! I cried 💖!!

11gugs0,"This happened to me a few years ago and letting the couple into my house was such a big mistake😅 they came to reminisce about their first house they bought together and then spent the next hour criticising and chastising me for design choices.

The bedroom had some disgusting, rotting floral wallpaper on which we tore down instantly and painted instead. They looked at me shocked and said I didn't understand ""class""

Complained that I converted the study in the attic into half man cave/half play area for the kids and they were just the most pretentious people ever.

Didn't kick them out because they were like 90 years old but definitely not letting people reminisce again🤭",2023-03-04 02:55:48

11gugs0,"My grandparents lived most of their adult lives in a small house in Alabama. Although it was nothing special physically, and it was always cluttered (my father was in his 50's when his father died and they sold the house, and his and his siblings' childhood toys were still there), there isn't anywhere I was more comfortable or at home.

A neighbor bought it, but never did much with it, and about eight years ago I took my wife and daughter to see it. It was unoccupied and in bad condition, the front room window was boarded up and the glass partly shattered. I took my daughter (about three at the time) around back and the sliding door to the den was open. We sat on the steps going in to the kitchen, but the door was boarded up.

Now it's fixed up and sold or rented out. They demolished my grandfather's office and my grandmother's sunroom, which is a shame, and built a front porch. It looks better, but I prefer the old version. I haven't been there since I took my daughter that day, it's about 500 miles away from where we live. I keep going through it in my mind as it was, hoping I'm haunting the place 🤣",2023-03-03 13:33:28

It's 9 hours away from where I live now and I spent nearly half of my life there and every summer when my family goes on vacation, the route we takes happens to take us through my old little small town. Sometimes we drive by and just take a look at the house. I've wanted to go back in and see how things look but also I think it would make me really sad at the same time. Idk. I like the idea and I think it would be really special to let her see her old home ❤️",2023-03-03 13:51:03

My nan noticed that the buzzer still listed the last name of someone she had as a neighbour and thinking it might be their kids that live there, she buzzed the number - And it turns out the same woman my nan knew still lived there! She invited us in and made us tea while pulling out photo albums with lots of pictures of her and her family with mine from 1970-1983 when my family moved back to Canada. It was so amazing to see that connection, and learn more about the local history! ❤️",2023-03-03 14:37:28

I looked at how the house looks now, they installed wooden floors, and they still have the office wall window (it was like a giant cut out in the wall)  i watched get put up, and they still have the memorial flower bush in the backyard from when my aunt passed when we lived there. the trees and plants outside are so much bigger now, and i can still see an old google map's picture of my mom sitting outside of the house 🥲  a couple days ago i drove past the neighborhood when i was visiting a friend, reminiscing so hard right now, i could point out every little thing i remember about the house,",2023-03-03 14:56:52

11gugs0,I hope you said yes! I tracked down an older man who lived in my apartment when he was a little boy in the late-1940s to early-1950s. He was really excited to hear from me because he'd always wanted to see the apartment again but had never been able to. He and his wife came by and told me some great stories about the SF of his youth. We're still email friends. It was really special  ❤️,2023-03-03 15:10:10
11gugs0,"When I was visiting my parents a few months ago I arrived at the same time as some people who were clearly looking around like they hadn't been there in ages. We immediately started talking about the cats walking around and one was immediately telling me how she had been born there (it was a tiny street and everyone kind of knows each other, so being born there basically means someone will definitely remember you :p) and I excitedly told her I had been born there too and was visiting my parents. Then it turned out they were actually there to see the old house again, which turns out was my parents house 😅 

I had never met the previous owners, so I didn't know them. She was the daughter of the guy who had sold my parents their house back in the day. Back then she was around the age I am now, so she had moved out a long time before that. So apparently we had both been born in the same house and she could tell so many stories about it, and the neighbourhood. She had even known my neighbours who had sadly all passed away already. I guess she had expected it, but the ones behind us died from cancer and the ones next to us from dementia, so it was sad to find out that's how they went :( 

She told us many things about our own house and even some of the stuff we decided to keep, which was very awesome! Apparently a little folding table we used all the time as kids and adults was made by her father! Real quality work there 😅 she was happy to see even we continued to enjoy the stuff they once owned :D 

People I told about it were worried they might have been scammers checking out the house and stuff to break into it, but we were lucky my parents did actually remember them, so we knew they were legit. I guess it might be safe to check if they really are previous owners and not just people checking out the house to break into it, but it would be a nice experience for both the precious owner and yourself in my opinion!",2023-03-03 15:25:23

That being said, do not simply let her and her husband in without having cameras inside first. We do not know what kind of people they are / aren’t 

I hope she enjoys her mother’s old sun room 😊",2023-03-03 16:22:26
11gugs0,"We visited my husband's grandmother over the summer in Tennessee (it was my first time meeting her). She wanted to show us all the places. So one day we went over to Oak Ridge where the Manhattan Project was stationed. Her father worked at the facility, but it was so secret no one knows what he actually did there. So we drove around the town, to the former site of the Project, and the old neighborhood she lived in. Her house she grew up in was not longer there, but the neighborhood still was. She was absolutely thrilled for the trip. She hadn't been back to the town for 50 years. She was as giddy as a teenager telling us stories and showing us places she used to go. We later met up with some more family members for dinner and she couldn't stop talking about the visit. It think this visit will last her the rest of her life. 🥹

I think it's worth the gamble to give this woman a brief look at her old apartment. She'll be raving to her friends and family for years to come. 😊",2023-03-03 16:56:42

fjmi1i,"But they’re still fine with everyone taking filthy paper out of their pocket with grubby (very likely unwashed) hands & passing it to someone else who will then usually not wash between taking that paper heating food items & touching cups in line for drinks to be made (so they can write names & orders) that will then be touched & consumed by the people who ordered those things.  

So it’s 
-
1) potentially infected person pulling paper out of their pocket after absentmindedly maybe say, biting their nails or wiping their nose (or here’s a big brain one- putting the cash in their mouth!  real efficient for carrying multiple items) which they forgot they did a half second ago & handing paper to barista. 
2) barista takes nasty coke, feces, covid, bubonic, snot encrusted paper-“& what’s the name on that order?”
3) using a sharpie, barista then uses grubby fecal-cocaine fingers on outside of cup-scribble scribble-then maybe let us graze the rim with the unwashed hand now as a cherry on top “NEXT in line!”
4) same procedure with same buboniccoke fingers all over everyone’s cups
5) now, customer can grab cup with bare hand & enjoy!!  putting it near, on & around mouth while absentmindedly scratching the nose, rubbing the eyes & maybe just taking off that lid & drinking that caffeine slurpy like an adult!- yep the one your barista grazed with their cokepoop stained hand.  Nummy!

Or this is in an ideal world where everyone is abiding the precautions of hand washing, hand sanitizer, hand washing right after handling cash & before touching another surface (here wait a minute!!  My best friend’s uncle’s wife’s best friends cousin’s birthday guest from grade 9 works in a ambiguous government job.  They said Covid can’t live on paper, metal, glass, fabrics, air, skin, rubber, plastic, food, in fact it magically evaporates the second it hits oxygen!!  Why are we worried????👍🏻), sanitizer, gloves?, hand washing, hand washing, hand washing, hand washing, hand washing, & I almost forgot, hand washing.  

In that ideal, perfect Mandela effect universe butting up to the edge of ours yet never merging, where no one forgets, or has an automated, muscle memory process absentmindedly in use during rushes— or hey, maybe also because they don’t take it seriously- cause in the alternate universe they do take it seriously (whereas we just want to believe they do in this one).  

In a that world where the Bernstein Bears are still “stein” -that’s very much unlike the world that produced the outbreak of an animal to human virus because (perish the thought) cleanliness was 2nd (even 3rd or 4th in the list) to efficiency & quantity.  

Cause in our world it’s sweet to assume people will go to that much trouble to stop “the common cold, flu, only kills the old ppl virus” but it’s not realistic.  Because most people see the cattle stampede for toilet paper & the monkeys panicking to eat hand sanitizer & assume this is another media scare tactic they won’t be taken in by.  Precautions are for dummies/sheep/the uneducated.  No way this brand new virus could mutate & even if it doesn’t “I’m not sick so why should it matter if I pass it to someone’s grandmother”

Thanks for discouraging people from loitering in the same space that they potentially already infected themselves or someone else in through the exchange of filthy lucre.  Oh & don’t forget those card terminals -touch touch touch -button button -touch touch swipe “uh it’s not working” “it’s a chip” “phyhhhh ooh k..where is it...” “underneath side there, you’ve only used the same thing 4,000 times this week” fumble fumble-rub rub - hell just assume the last person LICKED it.

While it's clear they are misinformed, I'm sure coming into a discussion and being berated the way he is is bound to put up some walls. 

I should be shocked that even in times of crisis people can't respect each other, but I'm really not at all. Everyone is tense and on edge right now but I feel like maybe until things normalize, we could all try to be decent to each other. I'm not saying you addressed them a particular way, I'm just pointing out why they might be getting particularly defensive in this thread.

Edit: Wow, who would have guessed toxic old Reddit would just downvote comments they don't like. Being mean is ok as long as the masses agree with it. Color me shocked 😂

A) This is a hotel so probably likely to have a higher level of professionalism of carpenters working for whatever big company that got the contract for this hotel as compared to some local carpenter(s) you’d get doing work on a residential home.

B) Decent doors are LEGIT expensive and while fiscally it might be cheaper to do two separate doors paying your average skilled carpentry guy.....but that cost difference is even more offset by the level of fancy this hotel chain is going for and wants to spend extra money on to not be a cookie cutter motel.

epkf1o,Chemo is unnecessary and needs to stop. We've definitely had a cure but there's no money in the cure! Chemo is a billion dollar business! 😤😤😤,2020-01-16 19:43:23

epkf1o,"I had a port too and beat cancer(leukemia). The nausea is the worst part besides eventual hair loss. If you can ask right away for synthetic THC pills that help with loss of appetite and nausea. It will help keep your spirits up, too. Take care!🙏🏽",2020-01-16 20:10:29
epkf1o,"I think that happening depends on what type of chemo you’re getting and how your body handles it, bc I’m pretty sure that didn’t happen for me when I was on chemo, my nails did get really frail tho. How you react to the chemo you’re taking is different for everyone, no one really reacts the same way as someone else for the most part. Trust your doctors and stay vocal about how you feel to the meds, and always take the meds. You’ll get through this 😊",2020-01-16 20:27:18
epkf1o,"I’m so sorry you’re in this shitty club, but you’ll be so glad you have that port when you start your infusions. I was just starting mine around this time three years ago, I had no idea what to expect. My nails actually escaped relatively unscathed, but I had AC chemo (The Red Devil) so I lost all my hair and had a bunch of other typical symptoms. Everyone experiences it differently, so I’m hoping it will be as easy as possible for you, considering. 

 I know there’s a bunch of great advice in this thread from other people who’ve been through it, but I’ve been thinking a lot about that time of my life lately, and this is what I will pass on to you from having been through it.

Keep a daily diary of this experience. Whatever you want it to be — how you feel, random thoughts, venting — whatever, but document this experience for yourself. It’s one of my biggest regrets that I didn’t do this, I was just in a really bad headspace at the time and I wish so much I had that to look back on now, to truly see how far I’ve come, day by day. I did take quite a few pics during the process; shaving my head, chilling in the infusion chair, lots of pics with my kids...and my favorite one of the day my dad showed up at my house with HIS head shaved, and his beard, in solidarity. ❤️ It’s to this day one of my favorite pics ever. Take those pics, you’ll be glad you have them later.

This is a brutal thing you’re facing, but you can do it!!! Just make it though that first day. And the next one. And the one after that. I hope you have a ton of support in our life as you go through this, but if you every need some encouragement or want to bitch about chemo shit, message me any time. You’ve got this. 🤘🏻🤘🏻",2020-01-16 23:59:20
epkf1o,"I'm so sorry for your loss. It makes me smile to know that he had a good sense of humor through everything he went through, I'm sure that made all of this a lot easier for both of you 😊 I always got pumped when my pee would be neon orange or the color of mountain dew.

13ikhf7,"That was an exchange mishandled... not the fault of cryptocurrency as a concept... Exchanges are a different beast.  You appear to be misinformed or undereducated about the nuance of all of this.   We can't be stuck between 2 worlds.  From a principled standpoint, crypto is a much better world to be fully into though, compared to traditional banking.

Is crypto fully convenient or the better option today?  Not quite... not quite... but that's only because the banks are fighting tooth and nail to keep it from happening.  Because they know it makes them obsolete.  They know its more fair.  They know its more ""socialist"", and better for the lower classes.   They know its the better solution....  It's quite literally a mathematical certainty.

The major problem right now with Crypto is the ""whales"" in fiat currency's ability to manipulate it.  Of course our money is better with banks and credit unions today... it's what our society has run on for as long as any of us can remember... and it has benefited those people for as long as we can remember.... so they have all the power to make us think they're the only option... they are not.

If we could switch fully to crypto tomorrow, and not need exchanges or fiat currency, we would all be better off...
But this transitional period is the battleground where sacrifices need to be made and change needs to happen.

As long as we are in transition, and ""Exchanges"" need to exist... then yes... there will be ""fuck shit"" and ""sus"" things going on, by everyone who holds all the Fiat currency today.  That has nothing to do with Crypto though, and everything to do with the current corrupt existence, pushing their influences through exchanges.

Edit: downvoted by losers who invested in an exchange promoted on the Superbowl 😂.  Please realize this makes you a dumbass.",2023-05-16 00:31:43

Now this is key you need to improvise and make a hole in the plate

Then lube it up and insert

Thank you guys so much!!  

Ok, I don’t know how to edit the original post to add additional text to it. 

- I had a Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (a weight loss surgery) years ago.  I *did* bust my tush to lose the weight, and lost way more then people typically do, but I also had surgery. 

- I train Olympic weight lifting. I lost so much, and have maintained that loss due to this, more then the surgery I think.  

- This photo was taken during a boudoir photo session, several months ago. The photographer works out of New England, her studio is in a converted mill.  The floor is old :) 

- The skin removal surgery (yes, that is plastic surgery) was in January.  At the time of this photo, I was 6 months out from that surgery, and COVID lockdown had just lifted. I’m actually “cushier” then normal in these pictures, because I hadn’t worked out in 6 months... and, well.  Because pandemic 🤪

- My surgeon is Dr Galvez in Tijuana Mexico.  He specializes in skin removal after massive weight loss.  He. Is. Amazing.  Absolutely incredible.  

- here is some video clips from the surgery, from my surgeon’s Instagram. Includes before pictures of the skin, and the removed skin. NOT SAFE FOR WORK!!!   [surgery video clips ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nwqrs79e57ze6c2/Video%20Jan%2017%2C%204%2015%2050%20AM.mp4?dl=0)

- For those of you saying it’s photoshopped.  Well, I mean... yeah.  How else did I get the black boxes on there.  🖕🏻.",2020-10-30 02:39:51

But as someone who's trying to lose weight (granted not so severely that I'll have lose skin I think?/hope?), I'll say that you look incredibly beautiful. Not in the sexualized way, but genuinely beautiful. Your scars don't define you, if anything they show that you're a warrior, and that you've fought a hard earned battle to lose the weight you had previously. If you ever feel self-conscious about the scars, or generally don't like them, always remember that they're a sign of your strength of character. What you did was incredible, so wear your battlescars proudly! ❤️",2020-10-30 17:21:14

I'm assuming mine were deeper and the whole synthetic-mesh-pushed-through-unrolledand-attatched-behind-your-abdomonal-wall thing probably had a lot to do with the pain, but still I can't imagine having incision as LONG as yours.

I’ve never seen this type of incision before. Most loose skin surgeries I’ve seen cut under the breast tissue and do a typical tummy tuck incision. I didn’t even know something like this was an option. 

What are the benefits and disadvantages of doing it this way? It seems like the results are much more symmetrical and realistic just with more obvious scarring. I’d prefer the extra scars with more natural results myself.",2020-10-30 04:46:01

Baby is 4, skin is still saggy, but I’ve never seen removal scars that were this beautiful. I was always afraid of the scarring but this makes me rethink that fear. Stunningly gorgeous ❤️",2020-10-30 16:56:43
jkmu5a,I 100% read this as “tell everyone you’re a republican”.   And was like wtf no 😂,2020-10-30 02:52:46
jkmu5a,🧟,2020-10-30 04:02:48
jkmu5a,"Oh it’s there. It’s a photo from above, so the leg skin is sort of dangling underneath 😂

I do have a decent amount of skin on my thighs, and plan to get a thigh lift from the same surgeon.  Some day.  COVID changed that plan. (It was supposed to be this winter)",2020-10-30 02:54:55
jkmu5a,"My surgeon keeps the belly button.  They do basically trim it and move it 😂

I’m not sure if anyone has asked to NOT keep it.  He probably would cater to that?",2020-10-30 03:24:59
jkmu5a,"I posted the video... somewhere in the comments 😂. 

It’s NSFW. It’s clips of surgery.  You’ve been warned. However it is quite interesting.

jkmu5a,"It won’t rip. I promise 😂

After THIS much weight loss, nothing but surgery will remove the excess skin.   

However, in regards to smaller weight losses, or a pregnancy - skin elasticity really is just a genetic lottery kind of thing.  Some people bounce back, others don’t.",2020-10-30 03:33:14
jkmu5a,"I did, for a few weeks afterwards.  It felt definitely like a disconnect touching one half of my stomach to the other.   They didn’t last very long, but they were definitely weird!  

One particularly memorable moment... The surgery really wasn’t as painful as I expected, it was very manageable.  However, I did have one pain episode the first night.  It felt like pain in my mid-abdomen area, which resulted in the attending on the floor rushing in to make sure there wasn’t a complication.    So when they were examining my mid abdomen area, nothing was painful.  She went to look at the incision around my hips, and THAT was where the pain was coming from.  When she told me that, I literally asked her “are you sure”.  

She was very very kind in response, when I’m sure internally she was rolling her eyes, thinking she can tell an incision site when she pokes one 😂

The skin that was pulled down to my hips CAME FROM my mid belly.  It was really weird.  (They did very quickly manage the pain, once we realized it wasn’t an unexpected complication)",2020-10-31 04:35:10
jkmu5a,"Oh definitely.  The skin was still a badge of honor, I worked hard to get the loose skin 😂

But the scars I’m also quite proud of, and do look better for sure!",2020-10-30 02:58:46
jkmu5a,"I did lose the weight, this surgery was removing the excess SKIN.  (About 8 lbs of skin).  

It’s so neat and organized because my surgeon is really good 😂",2020-11-06 02:35:27
jkmu5a,Lmao 😂😂😂😂,2020-10-30 12:45:10
jkmu5a,😂😂,2020-10-30 02:46:22
jkmu5a,"They can’t donate it. I did actually ask 😂

Apparently it’s too complicated, and the skin itself isn’t really GOOD skin. It’s damaged, stretched out etc.",2020-10-30 02:41:13
jkmu5a,"It was about $17,000.  I paid out of pocket because we went to Mexico. The pain honestly wasn’t as bad as I expected!   The drains suck.   I’m a stay at home mom, and was able to do my thing with my kiddo by 3-4 weeks out.  If I had a desk job, also could do that by 3 weeks out.  For a more physical job, where you’re on your feet a lot of the day, 6-8 weeks.  For a very physical job, 12 weeks.  I wasn’t cleared to work out until March 12.  (However... then COVID. 🤦🏻‍♀️)",2020-10-30 03:23:39

It really is amazing how talented the surgeons are.",2020-10-30 04:03:53

My tailbone takes me by surprise too. Ouch lol",2020-10-30 03:56:27
jkmu5a,I lost 25kg this year and have found myself touching things I've never felt before. Really foreign to begin with 😂,2020-10-30 04:27:22
jkmu5a,I’ve lost 50 since January and I can’t stop feeling my collarbone. 😂,2020-10-30 05:17:45
jkmu5a,"Right after weight loss surgery, and for 18 months or so after, you typically will not feel (physical) hunger.   However “head hunger” is a whole different ballgame.  

I’m going on 3 years out, and I do feel hungry.  But I also feel full after eating.   

I track and weigh food.  I count macros.  (Mostly for my workouts but it’s a good habit) 

The surgery will give you the tool, but you do have to make life long changes.   However I don’t ever feel deprived.  If I want pie, I eat pie.  Then track pie. And adjust the rest of my nutrition around the pie. 🤪",2020-10-30 03:59:55
jkmu5a,"I ran a shop for a good chunk of time. The issue with tattooing near scars is more often than not clients expecting to be able to tattoo something specific OVER the scar. Very rarely do people come in and think of incorporating the scar as a main piece of their design so .....a lot of times it's a ""please for the love of Christ take my suggestion ....otherwise that ink likely won't hold 🙏""

That said we did have this one bad ass chic who survived a shark attack come in to get shark teeth tattooed around the bite marks at the edge of the scars ....the effect came out similar to it looking like the teeth and dragged across her.  Plus she was cool as fuck.",2020-10-30 03:06:08
jkmu5a,ugh. YEA. I didn't expect you to call that out lol. Sitting on unpadded seats is now uncomfy 😂,2020-10-30 04:19:33

jkmu5a,I’m doing a 30 day Blogilates Ab challenge (hence the tailbone grinding moves). Guess I’ll do a glute challenge next 😂,2020-10-30 20:39:14
jkmu5a,"I missed this question! Hopefully you see this, I don’t know how to tag you.  

There are a couple different kinds of breast reductions..  some of them, (pedicle lifts) leave the nipple attached, via blood vessels and nerve endings, and it all basically gets folded back up inside there....(I’m sure it’s more refined then that, 😂).    Another style is called a free nipple graft, they basically take the nipple off entirely and reattach after.  

My lift was a pedicle.  I do have sensation, but it’s not the same exact sensation as it was prior to surgery.   Before, my nipples were a really big erogenous zone for me, afterwards they still are, but they are different.  I think a big part of the difference is before there was just so much skin, it could be really ... eh. “Manipulated”, easily. And after there, obviously, isn’t as much skin. 

But the sensation absolutely is there.  However, as someone else replied... it DEFINITELY is a YMMV type of thing, and the type of lift also plays a role.",2020-11-01 05:14:49
jkmu5a,"I’m so sorry you had to go through all of that. It’s a painful reminder that the WLS journey is not a “easy way out” or “walk in the park.” 

The risks of all WLS themselves are significant and participating in online forums and support groups is the best way to get life answers from people who have gone through it all and will share their experiences. 

Most complications in those forms are a result of the weight-loss surgery itself. But the ones that really break my heart, are ones like yours where you have gone through all of the work and this is supposed to be the part where you get to enjoy the reward of all of that work with the body you can really be proud of after all the excess is taken off.

WLS is never a journey that should be entered into
lightly. Thank you for sharing your experience so that those behind us can know our successes and be aware of what can go wrong. It’s takes a lot of work and there’s a lot of risk. 

I hope you seek counsel for the allergic reaction they ignored despite your complaints. You were in a horrible situation and adding a five day long searing allergy attack is unacceptable. My heart is breaking for you. I am so sorry for all you’re dealing with!! ❤️",2020-11-01 20:17:40

e9vd1c,Did you get this from Penguin publishing?! I bought this from the small book store at my office building on a rain day.

But then I thought if I was that toddler, I’d play with the sticker, eventually rip it off, play with it, then end up throwing it away before I got home. Prolly best it was placed on the back, out of sight out of mind 😂",2022-10-19 01:01:00

y7gtpu,"I really could have used this. For spring picture day, the school started sending reminders weeks beforehand. Not only the flyers, but digital reminders as well. After being beaten over the head with the news that picture day was approaching, of course it still slips past my last two brain cells.

My daughter comes home from school that day, and I get the flyer with the QR code to view my photos. I freeze and die a little inside, because of all the days my 4 year old decides to wear a hot dog dress to school, it was picture day. The silver lining was she completely owned the photos🌭",2022-10-19 02:07:45

P.S.: If you've never had Culver's, you're probably new to Wisconsin. You have to try the cheese. The international cheese-making competitions are always trumped by France, Italy, and Wisconsin. We're top of the line. Belgioso, Sartori, LaClare and Caprine Supreme make killer goat cheese.. 

Also, Pro Tip: If you see glass bottles of milk in supermarkets, that milk is 1) the shit, and 2) the bottle is returnable and you get $1.50 off.

c7g1bc,"I saw it in San Diego when it was in its limited release. A long drive but it was worth it.

The problem with it though is that it’s primarily a visual and auditory experience. The narrative itself is kinda boring at times, but the visuals and music make up for it completely. It sounds stupid saying it, but watching this movie on your phone, desktop, laptop, or regular TV setup will not cut it. The music and the beautiful animation are equally important.

You have had to had watched it in theaters when it came out, or have a decent home theater setup with good speakers or a decent headset to watch it now, or else it simply just won’t be as impactful.

If you have to watch it in a subpar environment though, I’d say it’s best to watch it alone, sitting down in front of a decently big desktop computer monitor, and with some good headphones 🎧r earbuds. Close the blinds and turn off every other light source.",2019-06-30 20:31:05

17yblio,"When I finally had enough money to buy my first car, my crazy ass decided to look into a ford model T, a rag top. I’m absolutely crazy and I loved the antique cars at the amusement park when I was little, and I wanted an antique convertible. They were so beautiful and just majestic. Why did I spend 200 hours search for one? Because I was just a jackass teenager. 

The only problem is I live where the air hurts my face and the snow fucks us 3/4 months out of the year. 

So when I begged my dad to go with me to test drive and buy a specific Model T he just looked at me like this: 😳

“What the fuck is wrong with you, it’s 2007 you cannot have a car made in 1918, no, you’ll get yourself killed! You’re done, I’m taking over” 

I wisely and thanks to my dad, ended up with a nice, safe, reliable, civic. But man did I dream about that Model T for years. I’m 35 and I still dream about it, someday I’ll have one. I’ll give everyone rides too. Such a magnificent piece of history is meant to be shared as much as possible, with as many people as possible.",2023-11-19 02:53:04

I’d start at the top of the driveway and get moving at a decent clip. Then, at the bottom of the driveway, I’d jump as hard as I could on the back of the deck so it would fly up in the air, and run away screaming, hoping it wouldn’t hit me on the head.

Thanks again for the good thoughts and I hope you're able to get out as often as possible, my friend 🙂",2021-01-24 20:28:35
l43y0r,"Sending good thoughts to you and your family ❤️

I was always 'intelligent' in school, but never, ever felt comfortable. Going into my profession, as much as I loved doing it, I'd only have about 6 good months of drive and enthusiasm at any new job or pursuit. Then it would all seem like so much time spent doing things I didn't enjoy to hopefully do the things I did like doing just a little in between.

My only thought would be, whenever you need someone to do something or hopefully change a view/attitude, give them more than one option.

If I wanted my child to put his coat/sweatshirt on to go outside, instead of 'put your coat on' or 'you know what we do before we go out', I'd ask them 'what do you want to wear, this or that?' or 'you're pretty smart, what should we wear, a sweatshirt or a coat?'

Or in the case of someone who's feeling so out of place that they need to yell and scream, I'd approach the same way: give a few options that you're ok with of something else they could be doing, and let them feel and be the one to decide.

When you need to set rules, let them be a part, give options you're ok with no matter what they choose, and then it's 'their own rules' they'll be breaking.

Lastly, I'd say to try (it's so, so hard, I was that kid), to not give any 'power' to their negative words and actions (unless it's a harmful action, of course). If they started swearing I'd act exactly like the words for nothing. 'i want to fucking go outside!' they say just to use the f bomb. You say, 'cool, you think a sweatshirt or jacket would be best?', like the f didn't exist.

*I apologise if this sounds like I'm pretending to know anything about anything. You comment just sounded like it was a difficult situation, so I'm offering some specific actions that I've seen help and feel would have helped me.

So disregard all my 'advice' if you feel it's telling you I know what you should do, and take for what it's worth don't kind words and thoughts directed to you and your family. Be well ❤️",2021-01-24 20:49:11

Every time someone came inside even if you lived there, he’d run full speed and shove his huge head into your crotch, and if you blocked him he’d just sniff from behind. One family friend came wearing a skirt and he went all the way in there… such a weirdo

**Edit for stupid people:** full speed is like 1mph seeing as he was a senior dog with 3 legs and 100% blind, and also like 48pounds from growing up malnourished with teeth falling out in old age. Family and friends were *very* aware of this since we fostered dogs and everyone loved to see them while we had them.  Not every pit/pit mix is a terrifying death machine waiting to strike🤷‍♂️ Strangely, some people are okay with dogs who can’t see anything sniffing them for a few extra seconds… weird huh?",2022-09-16 18:00:16

-----

Remember when i stood there, looking out behind the screen

The light was shining on me, in a way you'd never seen

and then you took a picture, that you cherish to this day

I am the dog who left too soon -

'The one that got away...'

It seemed a perfect setting there, and little did we know

that i would have to leave, too soon -

it's always hard to go...

my soul i leave behind with you! a perfect 'Work of Art'

Forever I am with you, friend -

My pawprints on your heart

129uaxq,"When I moved to another state we rented a house with an in-law aADU ( for the owners to keep their belongings ) .  Eventually owners emptied ADU and rented it out to a single mom and child.

She was strange from the get go 

Long story short boy had an accident in the property n her ex found out and wanted full custody.

Few days later she dyed her son’s hair and n cut it.
Thought “wtf” and next day I notice she didn’t come home.  Didn’t think much of it til 2 days later 3 police cars pull up .  I happen to know the police man as his wife was my daughters teacher.  He explained she was suppose to meet ex to surrender her boy but bolted out of state.   The poor kid…. She was definitely not in her right mind.

129uaxq,"I have also kept mine, for shits n giggles when I'm feeling down. An ex-friend turned out to be toxic and dangerous and didn't like it when I found the courage to escape her. She reported me to Social Services (UK) and we had a random lady turn up one morning, claiming a report had been made that I was neglecting my child. My daughter was 4 at the time and I was raising her alone in a rough area, but she was healthy, happy and once we closed the front door we were safe and spent every second together. Some of the claims my ex-friend made was that my daughter had a diet of super noodles (ramen) and went to school in pyjamas and I never brushed her hair and spanked her. The SS lady knew instantly that it was a false report, and claimed it was an anonymous phone call received, but said she had to carry it out. I had just been paid so we had a fridge full of fresh produce and my daughter was feeling chatty that day and charmed the pants off her. When she sat me down to get my side of the story. She said she was unable to confirm my suspicions but when I put to her that I bet the anonymous person that called was an older woman with a thick raspy Pakistani accent. The lady nodded at me. We both knew.

My favourite part in the whole report was ""I find the claim that OPs daughter lives on a diet of noodles unfounded and ridiculous. OP was cooking their evening meal when I arrived and I saw no evidence of unhealthy food. OP was cooking a fish dinner with vegetables. Child looks healthy and in no way malnourished.""
My daughter had already eaten her tea before the lady arrived and hated fish 😂",2023-04-03 07:12:33

129uaxq,"I read stories like this... and I feel like the things my mother did weren't so terrible, right? She was pretty much Mommie Dearest, with the crazed cleaning obsession and ""no wire hangers"" type of incidents. Except, when I was a teenager, she did once try to drunkenly shove me down the basement stairs, and after I scratched her arm grabbing it to keep from falling, she told everyone I had *stabbed* her!

But this makes me so angry, because Children's Services investigated me multiple times and threatened to put my daughter up for adoption on reports from my psycho mom that my house was ""filthy"" and that my then 6 year old played in the fenced-in back yard on her own. 🤦🏼‍♀️ When the agent showed up at my house, she looked *stunned* that my house was not, in fact, ""filthy,"" and that the back yard was all fenced in, neat and tidy, with a swing set and toys, and a gigantic picture window that allowed me to watch my daughter from three different rooms.

ETA: I apparently have a person called ""Bunniemonkey"" stalking me across threads. There are a lot of mentally ill people on Reddit, and she's obviously one of them. If y'all could encourage this woman to seek help, I'd greatly appreciate it.

ETA2: Bunny is a very troubled lady with a lot of demonstrably incorrect claims... Such as her discriminatory claim that disabled people are all faking it to avoid paying child support, because she's angry at her disabled father for not being in her life. She's now gone off the deep end to stalk me for the ""crime"" of pointing out that [benefits are in fact paid to the children of disabled people.](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/qualify.html#anchor7) Now she's making the incorrect claim that CPS wouldn't investigate my mother's false report, despite the fact that, ""In accordance with section 2151.42.1 of the Revised Code, the public children services agency (PCSA) shall investigate each report of known or suspected child abuse or child neglect, or threat thereof, which is referred to it. Furthermore, section 5153.16(A)(1) of the Revised Code also states that the PCSA shall make an investigation concerning allegations of an abused, neglected, or dependent child."" Bunny desperately needs that therapy. If y'all could report her hateful, harassing comments, I'd be very grateful.",2023-04-03 05:25:30

10470qj,"Would it be worth taking into consideration the varying attitudes on drinking pre and post prohibition for perspective?

I have nothing to specifically site, but remember reading several different articles about drinking habits being even greater (pre); was more casual, safer then water, youth drank, people drank at work on the job at lunch (building skyscrapers and such), while temperance movement is pre-prohibition it wasn’t until right before alcohol was outlawed, but after prohibition “drinking culture” has had constant foes in various movements and groups, as well as science over the years getting better of what life’s LD50 for death or developing “delirium tremens”.

My point being, if I got one??, IS “society”, upbringing, learnededness 🫣, and culture itself tries to push an objective narrative on how you should live your life, and what desires you’re allowed to have, like total Karma Police, on something that for the most part is a subjective and harmless (if in controlled set and setting) activity, that’s nobody’s business,,, “as long as you good bro, you ok, you need to talk”, if that makes sense.

All that being said- great idea for keeping yourself(s) honest. Things get hazy, and charting out mind altering substance shifts is a great self check for reminding yourself, “maybe I’ll just take a hot epsom salt bath, drink some water and reset tonight with some sleep”.",2023-01-06 02:29:45

Thank you for posting this, it really helps me “keep it green”. Literally. lol 😆 sorry - I couldn’t resist. It was just too perfect of an opportunity to say this. 

And the best part about initially not drinking - even though you feel like shit in the beginning, your bank account is much happier than it was before!

djsdt4,"Hard hats are completely unnecessary with Jack Corps Industrial Brain Plating™! You can now wear your previously old, dumb, and rusty skull with a brand new brain plating! Our plating helps with brain protection by first removing the scalp, making sure that no cranial injury will result in any nerve tissue damage. Then we will use a standard treepanning (patent pending) method to fill the skull with liquid nylon that will harden, and be used as the base for our cranial casing! Line that baby with liquid iron and place on the Brain right? No! Our team over at Jack Corp Labs™ will do you one better! With a simple additional payment of $129.99, we will line the casing with high acting joy buzzers to keep the brain alive and active in case of comas, death, sleep, or other preventable ailments! Now take a look at you! Happy as a seal! Now you will never need to worry about any head trauma again! For the normal brain plating, pay a simple fee of $299.99 and head to the nearest Jack Corp™ unlicensed surgery clinic! And remember our motto: “A sad patient is a mad patient!” So if you don’t like our service, there is probably an underlying issue that can be easily fixed with another one of our surgeries or other miscellaneous products! So come get a Jack Corp Brain Plating™ today!

Jack Corp™ is not liable for any issues that may come up after the Jack Corp Brain Plate™ surgery. And issue that may appear to be caused by the surgery is a result of a disorder/disease that you already had.",2019-10-19 01:06:29

niuyuc,"Oh god, I just had a really weird flashback - when I was a youngish teenager in the mid 2000s, I went to a film camp with my friend. I had a mobile I didn't use much that was set up to have just one number as being the 'free' one, so you could call it as often as you wanted without charges. However, any other number charged by the minute. I believe all the phones I had up until that point where like that.

When my friend told me she had a new phone where she had 60 MINUTES TALK TIME all excitedly it blew my mind. I just didn't know that was a thing. She let me use the phone to call someone, and I called some guy who I was chatting to at the time. I had no concept this was only 60mins a month, for some reason I thought 60minute for each session, and after that it would start charging you by the minute. So I spent all 60 minutes just talking to this guy. 

Her parents really angrily rung up mine, saying I needed a talking to because I spent all her minutes for the month and she had rung up a huge bill from all of her own calls. 

I just really stupid and didn't understand 😂",2021-05-24 07:23:43

a29yp0,I recently lost a most beloved cat named Bo. He was my best friend and even my husband knows that Bo was the love of my life. He passed in my arms while we cried together. I had him cremated and bought a beautiful teardrop necklace from perfect memorials  the teardrop contains some of his ashes so now he goes with me everywhere. 💔,2018-12-02 15:51:03
a29yp0,"I'm so sorry for their loss. We had our 19 yr old friend put down a few months ago and I still miss him every day. We got his real prints in ink and I got 1 tattooed along with his portrait. I love the idea of flowers or a plant outside. I hope it gives them peace, my thoughts are with your friend and their family. Thanks for sharing, brings good memories 🙂",2018-12-03 03:07:48

a29yp0,"Tape the top of the urn shut, and say;
(Your cats name) roll over! Then proceed to roll it on the counter. 
I was super distraught after my dog passed away,  (My stepfather and I rescued him from a junkyard in January of 1999) and I was very inebriated with my stepfather when he did this in the living room. My stepfather was also very affected by Chance passing. 
It lifted that weight of his passing immediately. 
I am sorry for your loved one leaving you; but they are always there. 💜
I miss my Chance, and your little 4 legged friend will never truly leave you. 
I have a cat now, Jade, and she acts very much like Chance. Almost to a Tee. ",2018-12-02 06:56:34

a29yp0,"It’s all good man. Some places actually do real paw prints. I’ve yet to go through it with any of my personal pets (to young, but I mourn the day), but some of my friends pets have gone and it’s weird seeing them gone and how my friends deal with it. 

It’s even weird for me when you’re pretty much a second child to that family and their pet isn’t there. 

Take care man 💗 ",2018-12-02 14:37:01

a29yp0,"We just lost our buddy Cody cat to cancer after having him for 14 years.  I was so happy that I was able to spend some time with him and when he was on the pain medicine and steroids he seemed very much like his normal old self for about a month. 

 Having to let him go was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do.  I’m so sorry you’re going through this cause I know how much it hurts... if I can offer advice (since I’ve had to go through the same thing very very recently)  even though saying goodbye is devastating, waiting too long until your kitty is suffering is regrettable.  I said goodbye to Cody pretty quickly after he was taking a turn for the worst.  His cancer was in his face and mouth and it was causing him trouble breathing and he couldn’t eat.  That’s one thing veterinarian told me:  if they stopped eating then that’s a sign it may be time. 

I’m happy I was able to give him a little more time and that when he went he wasn’t suffering terribly.  Again, I’m sorry because I know it is just heartbreaking.  ❤️",2018-12-02 05:48:11

a29yp0,"She loves you more than anything, and you love her just the same. You’re deeply bonded. You’ve already seen each other at your worst. You’ll both be scared, and sad, and confused... but you’ll be together. You’ll be in that moment together, and I think if you could ask her, that’s all she’d really want. Just you, there. No matter what state you’re in. It’s understandable to not want to be present, because it really is so scary, but it can also be a really poignant way to end that wonderful journey you’ve went on together. Holding her and just showering her with every ounce of love you’ve ever felt for her, and giving her your tears as a gift to carry with her to wherever she’s going next. 

I hope that day doesn’t come for a long, long time and you have many more years with your baby, and I hope when her life comes to a close you’ll be ready and it won’t be so hard to be with her on her last journey, and it’ll be a beautiful, meaningful goodbye for you both ❤️",2018-12-02 14:23:37
a29yp0,"I have a facemask on don't make me cry more 😭
But seriously, that is so sweet and I'm so happy to know that. It's so heartwarming that you and other shelters really put care into these animals. Were any of the animals labelled as aggressive change their behavior with you once you started working with them? I always thought about how a lot of the animals labelled aggressive were proboaly just very scared and needed someone to be patient with them before they showed themselves.",2018-12-02 08:17:00

juuxar,"Indeed! Look at you: a human? Sure, that's how you label yourself and establish your limits of self. But look closely, you are made of components: organs, those in turn are made out of cells, other forms of life. You have gut bacteria that is responsible for regulating how you feel. Again, living organisms.

As above, so below; let us look above the human scale: a family is another layer of this abstract fractal, above the family there's the larger society (like city, country) forming a living network of cells (humans). Then there's the whole planet, in which plants, fungus, and animals like ourselves live (or should live) in perfect harmony as to keep the whole organism ""earth"" healthy. That's not what's happening rn. Anyways.


Look at your arms, it's a simple fractal (unfolding straight line). Btw the proportions of your fingers, forearm, whole arm, obey a ratio: the golden ratio. Pretty cool!


Trees, roots, fruits, vegetables, moss, mushrooms and fungi, animals, rivers, blood vessels, crystals and minerals... The list goes on. They are all capable of fractal displays. 

Have fun seeing the fractal world!

ufzorw,"So anyway, I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.",2022-05-01 15:55:03

Tiles are never actually the full exact 6"" measurement- usually fractions of an inch off. So that working in combination with the grout lines worked out perfectly.

73tv7u,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2017-10-02 21:21:14

take4p,"man I wish I had thought of something clever like this. I was so annoyed with school I didn't keep a collection of anything. Except for one time in preschool, when I stole half the sequence decorations that you could use to make projects. I would refer to them as my ""sparkle collection."" Lmao I still have that & ig one other thing I have had in the past. It was a collection of old ballet shoes that the dancers would decorate whatever company performance was going on that season and then would put in the small ""kids marketplace"" to sell after the performance to raise money. This was at my old, classical dance school I danced at for a long time, & was a big dream of mine to be in the company. Parents would buy them as a ""memory souvenir"" type gift and it was supposed to inspire the younger students to continue dancing. After I quit dance at the year of 2017 and despising dance for so long after, I quickly decided to get rid of them last year after going through and getting rid of lots of crap that was in my room.😂😂",2022-04-05 01:27:22

3 months later, he gets another letter, from the same bank, remaining him he owes them $0.00 and if he fails to pay, they will send a debt collector. Again, tells us the story, laughs about it and shugs it off.

nocap I used to work at a metal warehouse & one day outta the blue we had new management..when I say they were the definition of micro manage, they would pop outta the blue like “what’s the ETA on that rebar order?” every 30 minutes knowing good & mf well that orders gonna take a minimum of two days.Anyways my supervisor was literally over it on this particular day & told em “fuck this & fuck you” he was trying to rage quit basically, so to persuade him to stay I swear to god they told him give them till the end of the day, they’ll have a “meeting” about it, left the warehouse right there & then came back almost 4 hours later! Mind you my managers just walking around mad at this point..ANYWAY they come back with FUCKING bags of food, didn’t give him any food but gave my supervisor a 99 cent card with “We appreciate you & thank you for your 25 years with the company” written inside, & a $25 Amazon gift card….

lyq0gm,"In the form they used it, it's an astigmatism. That being said, language is bendy and grammar enforcement is inherently classist.

**Edit:** Honestly, I do not mind being mass downvoted but I am afraid I mischaracterized my intentions. The origins of grammar enforcement was to separate the the wealthy classes that could afford the new grammar school trend from the poorer social classes that could not. It's why you see past works (from before grammar enforcement became popular), like Shakespeare have different spellings for some of the same words. You could spell a word any way that sounded correct based on how you were taught letters sounded and it was fine (like Irish Twitter™ for a modern example). Today, the attempt to separate the classes via grammar is not as prominent, but the disdain for people who haven't learned every single fucking rule is still ever present and it's *inherited* from the intentions of having enforced grammar rules in the first place. That's why prefaced the word classist with ""inherently."" 

My point was, language evolves rapidly. The word ""literally"" is now a secondary, slang definition in the common dictionaries under ""figuratively."" Is it really that important to be constantly pedantic?",2021-03-06 02:39:35

Fun little story on how I got into watching Colombo: when I was about 12 y/o, I had half days on Tuesdays, so I was expected to come straight home and get my homework done. Instead, I’d turn the tv on and watch a couple hours of tv. I was flipping channels one day and saw this show playing. I thought it was entertaining and recognized some of the other big names- mostly Star Trek characters. In fact, one of those episodes was on when my dad surprised me by coming home for lunch. I didn’t hear the garage door, and before I knew it, my dad was standing in the kitchen looking at what I was doing in the living room. God, I thought I was in so much trouble. But all he did was say ‘oh, Colombo.’ Then he grabbed his lunch and joined me 😂 

It became a ritual every Tuesday.",2021-03-06 07:30:24
lyq0gm,"Yea im not sure. Like i said, my info is limited. We also all have brown eyes. My pupils are large, even normally. Or at least larger than anyone I've come across. Not crazy large, but definitely larger than ive seen in others. 

I dont have insurance and havent gone to the eye doctor in over 15 years (even tho i def need to bc I need to get glasses lol). I was gonna say, if i can remember, or even go, I'll def try to take a pic and post it lol. I just remember looking in the mirror when I got home and being like ""holy shit, I can barely see my eye color!"" 

So maybe it was an allergic reaction? Light? Idk. But they def were almost all pupil & to the edge of where the color would start. It was like a sliver of color, the rest was pupil. Idk if that makes sense? It wasn't all pupil but there was barely any brown left, like it was close to being all pupil. It was as if you were to draw a circle with a pencil tip, that thinness would be the color. So it was def touching the edge.


ETA- formatting 🤦🏻

E2- so I just looked at the google images for ""dilated eyes"" and what mine did doesnt seem that weird because I came across pics where they are dilated and almost touching the edge. I even saw one where the top part of the pupil was touching the edge but the rest of it wasn't. So the fact that mine were right there at the edge isnt impossible. Just uncommon prolly 🤷🏻",2021-03-09 06:41:39

I pet her and tell her what a good hunter she is; she then proceeds to messily devour it. 🥰",2021-07-20 21:56:27

10fl031,"There is an episode of the animated series where an actual alien space ship comes down, and it has another Mr Bean in it, who wins Irma's affections. Eventually he shows Irma the space ship, and it's full of yet more Mr Bean clones (each with a different animal toy instead of Teddy). Irma is a bit freaked out so runs away. The actual Mr Bean is also on the space ship and wants to go with them, but they decide he is better off with Irma, so he's beamed down to earth (at which point the familiar music plays). 

That's the rough gist of it, at least. It's entirely possible they came up with that storyline just for the beaming down joke. Howard Goodall does the music for both the original series, and the animated version, so I'm sure he was in on it.

We watch the animated one quite often with our boys (sometimes even the original). I'm not an obsessive Bean fan 😀",2023-01-19 07:56:59

You cite people who don’t use mosquito nets or wear seatbelts. Could we classify these people as people who take more risk, or maybe better yet people who don’t think logically, could this also be expanded to their sex lives? Maybe they are less likely to have protected sex and therefore are offsetting those who die earlier by having more children? 

Also alcoholism is likely to lead to an early death however not before reproductive age and therefore those genes are likely still being passed on. 

Maybe it’s nit picking but natural selection is one of the mechanisms of evolution. Selection is definitely still happening, but is natural selection...?",2019-05-22 01:51:00

pmt0zb,"Hi! I hope this gets seen! I’m an analyst for a Fintech company, in the Chargebacks/Fraud Operations world. It is against MasterCard/Visa’s “rules” (there are actual operating rules banks/merchants must abide by in order to process on the different payment card networks) to charge these types of fees… In order for a hotel, rental car agency, etc. to charge your credit/debit card after your stay w/out your direct authorization, they have to have direct proof that you caused damage to your room. 

So, basically, you would have had to sign an invoice/bill acknowledging the $250 cleaning fee. Because of this, it’s nearly impossible for these charges to stick. They’re *extremely* unfair… hotels and rental car companies will charge you for “cleaning” with absolutely no proof that you were the one who caused the “smoke damage”. 

If you **ever** are charged a cleaning fee by any hotel, AirBNB, car rental company, etcetera. Call your bank and dispute it. We can easily win the case for you. You should never have to pay for a company’s deep cleaning, just because they need to be able to offset their costs. 

🌈The More You Know

Edit: just to add, if you knowingly trashed a hotel room or rental car, disputing it on your credit card does not absolve you from being held responsible. The company can still come after you through other collection routes, but they won’t bother unless they have solid proof.",2021-09-12 18:01:10

Standard allergens and then odd ones things like chocolate and newspaper print making me sneeze. Which makes sense as I am allergic to Pine and newspaper ink is rosin made from pine tree sap, called colophony

The chocolate is actually variant of photic sneezing.The name of the syndrome that is given to people who have photic sneezing is called Autosomal Compelling Helio-Opthalmic Outburst, which stands for ACHOO syndrome. Which I think is perfect.


The 'Dark chocolate sneeze' which affects about 25 to 30 percent of the population is on Chromosome 11. SNP rs11213819 is the identified Neanderthal variant.

But I went profoundly deaf and it was because my eustachian tubes were completely blocked and I'd already had a blown eardrum. I was born with allergies to dairy and a lot of medical problems and they told my parents I wouldn't survive but they weren't that lucky, lol but I was born without an immune system and I don't produce a proper amount of white blood cells and I don't produce antibodies so I battled a lot of infections and illness and as it turns out I'm allergic to all but 3 known antibiotics and most medications. I can take acetaminophen for pain and morphine derivatives and that's it! Life is just a joy 😂. I'm allergic to almost all foods, I can eat chicken and fish, some fruits and vegetables but no legumes, lentils, nothing that grows in a pod, no mushrooms or yeast. No corn or corn byproducts and I had no idea Tito's vodka was pure corn because I don't drink, I'm allergic to most alcohol so that was fun! 🤪 I lived in Florida and I'm actually allergic to the sun, they're trying to figure out what I'm not allergic to because they think that list would be shorter 😂. No nuts of any kind and NO CHOCOLATE, I don't care, I'll suffer! I had shots every 3 days for over 7 years and they want to test me again because I have developed new allergies and they want me to have more shots and I said no. I've died several times due to allergic reactions and most of those were caused by doctors errors and I'm a former nurse and I know what to do and I'm almost 60. They never thought I'd survive my birth and I've done that and a lot more than that! In life you have to have a sense of humor because shit happens every day and you never know what's going to happen next but the best way to deal with it is to smile and laugh because that might not cure you but it will sure help get you through the day!",2023-01-24 06:30:07

10jouu8,Ouch 😣,2023-01-24 02:10:35
10jouu8,"Lmao that reminds me of when I went through this, though it was the exact opposite. 

I am very likely allergic to *something* in my environment and I get mild, daily symptoms from it. When I went to a specialist to try and determine the cause, they poked me with a bunch of allergen samples just like this to see what I reacted to. 

Well, they did the test and we sat there waiting for a reaction. And we waited… and waited…. aaand finally I saw one small single bump! Yay we found it! But then the doctor quickly spoke up to let me know that what I was seeing was simply an expected reaction to the control for the test and not an actual allergen from the test. 

We waited a few more minutes, but nothing else reacted at all. Never been more bummed to be told I’m not allergic to anything in my life (well, at least anything they tested that day). 

Still experiencing mild allergy symptoms to this day 🥳 …wooooo",2023-01-24 02:11:47
10jouu8,I just had an allergy test/panel today as well. Quite the experience. I only had 40 though 😆,2023-01-24 02:14:25

10jouu8,"Agreed. 

Unfortunately, allergy shots aren’t permanent if not consistently taken throughout life.

Found that out a few years after finishing up with them. 

I still think the tests results aren’t super accurate. But, that’s just my opinion. So, it really holds no weight. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️🤷",2023-01-23 22:25:05
10jouu8,Give it time. Maybe in 20 years he will be! 😂,2023-01-23 23:17:03
10jouu8,"it's honestly awful lol. it amounts to like, a minor disability. it's much better now that i'm older for a variety of reasons (no longer dog height, people listen to me now 🙄, i have full control over where i go, plus asthma naturally gets better as the lungs grow as i'm sure you know), but when i was a kid it was a constant nightmare. the most unexpected part of it is that anytime people are rubbing against each other in public - bars, clubs, concerts, moshpits, sports events - they can trigger a minor allergic reaction if they have dog hair on their clothes. i can go to houses where dogs live, but the places i touch have to be clean of all dog hair, and there has to be sufficient ventilation for there to be no dog particles in the /air/. i have had asthma symptoms from standing in a front hallway, fully clothed in winter clothing, just from breathing the air. i cannot touch any dogs ever. technically i am not allergic to the hair on dogs that have hair instead of fur, but i'm still allergic to their saliva and probably their entire bodies too. wack-ass allergy to have in a culture where some people genuinely consider their dogs their children and think they should be able to bring them everywhere, lol",2023-01-24 00:29:43

We went with a sort of spooky horror theme, decorated the library, employed a tarot card reader for the night, screened “Arachnophobia”, fed them pizza and let the teens make as much noise as they like. It was quite successful and we got a lot of good feedback. 

Like you said, it’s a safe place where teens can hang out and they’re supervised but not watched over by parents or teachers.

Teens are at a certain point in their lives where they DO understand the kind of behaviour that is expected of them, but they’re still kids too and like to let their hair down. 

I think letting them have their own area of the library is a great idea, and it gives them a sense of ownership over the space too 😊",2018-10-11 15:04:57

The jokes in CAH are only as PC as you want them to be. The newer decks are just several of the pre-existing numbered decks grouped into colour coded packs, to make building the full deck easier. 
Having the word ""patriarchy"" in a card doesn't make CAH pc mad. Ive made many an offensive joke with that card. 
I think a few here miss the point of CAH or have never played it. 
YOU MAKE THE JOKES FGS 🤦

Also if you think thats funny, CAH i believe have purchased a plot of land which Trump was building a border wall on. If you can't enjoy a simple card game because ""muh president"" then CAH ain't for you. ",2018-11-28 21:21:54

ru8cdv,"No regular Goldfish? They're the best. JIF is my favorite peanut butter. Whatchamacallit is a great, but underrated candy bar. Sweet Baby Rays is great, but I prefer the original. A1 is a good sauce, but you shouldn't NEED it for steak. 😉

Oh, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch is the best cereal.",2022-01-02 15:00:47

ru8cdv,"Ah, for those die hard Arm and Hammer brand loyalists😂. I’m always amused to see what people are nostalgic for. Usually junk food, but that’s also because it’s non perishable and very shippable. I always hear how our bread products are unique(painfully sweet to others) but are never in the American Aisle. Wouldn’t be worth the import for the short shelf life.",2022-01-02 13:33:44
ru8cdv,"I’m an American that lived for decade in Ireland. 
The only thing we ever missed was peanut butter. Paid many an airline overweight luggage fee to import our stash.
…and by “we,” I only mean me and my spouse. My Irish-born kids discovered Nutella, and there was no looking back. LOL

Rest of Irish/UK groceries were 👍 - especially the breads, milk products, and meat that didn’t have the mysteriously long shelf lives of their American counterparts.",2022-01-02 17:16:44

It is not a well designed area. Fucking Brentwood and Clayton make me want to die. 

I always go the back way through the industrial area. It’s a longer drive but takes so much less time overall when it’s packed on a Saturday.

1) You didn't ask. You basically said ""How dare you use a word (that most people clearly already understood, based on how many people were using it) and not explain what it means?"" rather than the reasonable, mature alternative of ""What does that word mean?"".

2) Tree grafting is similar enough to skin grafting for most people to infer the meaning with context clues.

3) Read your post again and tell me you don't sound like an whining, entitled brat, expecting everyone else to gloss anything outside of the 100 most common English words, which, according to you, now qualifies as ""*esoteric terms*"" lmao

10l94jq,">patients have said Flagyl is the worst.

Can confirm. As someone with Crohn's disease who took it for years, Flagyl has to be the worst. The pills are in no way coated; simply handling them leaves residue on your fingers, like chalk. As soon as it touches anything wet, it starts to dissolve, which includes the liquid in your mouth. So, I do drink, pill, drink, drink, drink. I also don't use water; gotta be something flavored to cover the taste if there's contact. Make sure you get any liquid that came in contact with the pill out of your mouth. It is some of the most bitter stuff I've ever tasted.

There's also a bit of a psychological effect that goes on. The medicine helps treat Crohn's, but it's awful on your stomach. So, you want to take it even less knowing the taste is gonna make you gag, and the medicine is gonna make you feel like puking anyway.

But it's still a pill, so I'd still rather take it than liquid potassium 🤮",2023-01-26 00:19:43

He probably only orders Turkey sandwiches. Never once thinks to put pepper on it. They ok do it. If ask for pepper at subway, they'll do it.

ud8vgz,"Lol who is the person on top who got black listed due to a steak hoagie and large pizza 😆

What is the story there?",2022-04-28 19:48:57
ud8vgz,"Almost every bar I worked at had one of these, not always posted though. Usually were customers who were bad drunks who started fights with others, gave a hard time to the barmaids, didn't tip, etc. One place actually had a restraint order against one guys GF because she would call constantly & come up there threatening the barmaids for ""trying to get with her man"" I think she threw a bottle through the window one time too! 😂 I had a b**ch throw a glass at me & her twin grab me by the hair because I cut them off. My BF bodily threw her out the door. Then called the cops on ME!!!😳THEY were banned after my boss saw the video. I also got another b**ch banned for stealing my tips off the bar, & a guy who called me a C**t & wanted to fight me. Although I think the best one was a guys booty call that repeatedly rammed his car in the lot!! 😳🤣🤣🤣 Just another day in the life of a divebar drinks slinger!",2022-04-29 15:09:54

ud8vgz,"Reminds me of the time I answered the door to find a SWAT team expecting to find a suspect. They had to call off the rest of the team that was waiting at the back door. Scared the hell out of me since I was growing a little weed plant at the time, had to flush the poor guy out of panic at that moment. I miss that plant everyday 😭",2022-04-27 22:20:45
ud8vgz,"I gave away some bedroom furniture on Facebook a few weeks ago. Lady showed up with her boyfriend who was our old Dominos delivery guy. Knew my order and my food allergies. Said it’s posted on their list “no dairy-good tipper” get it right. 🤣

I was so proud of myself lol.",2022-04-28 02:33:57
ud8vgz,"Yeah sorry about that last one. I always forget i haven’t worked out before ordering pizza. And with all those damn carbs I know the guilts coming.

ud8vgz,"Oh, I thought it was something much worse 😂",2022-04-27 21:26:02
ud8vgz,"5 years ago I got a new number and I kept getting cryptic phone calls and voicemails in the late hours of the night. People asking for ""Stevie easy"" and hanging up immediately after they realized I was not Steve, voicemails saying ""looking for my usual"", I even got texts from people. I really didn't put two and two together until a probation officer secretary lady called me looking for Steven AKA Stevie Easy. After a few minutes of convincing her I knew no location of Mr Easy and had never met him, she advised me to change my number as he was on probation for drug related offenses 😭. So I guess I kind of accidentally turned him in?!",2022-04-28 02:44:51
ud8vgz,"I had that happen with my phone number, and I've had the number for like twenty years. Someone just randomly started giving it out to people. Spam calls. Debt collectors. Sleazy guys who tried to pick her up at a bar. Everyone got given my number. I finally managed to ask enough questions of callers to track Heather down and I sent her a demand letter threatening to sue her for $100,000 for loss of business and defamation (it's a number I use for business too). She stopped using it 🤣",2022-04-28 02:51:56
ud8vgz,"This happened with my son. I got sick of them harassing my child so we got him a new number. We asked for one that had never been used before. They said they gave him one, but I don't actually know if it's even possible. 😬🤣

Regardless, he doesn't get shifty calls anymore, so I'm happy.",2022-04-28 01:55:51
ud8vgz,Idk where they say Hogie at to be fair 😂,2022-04-27 21:16:47
ud8vgz,Please tell me you told the lady her new number so she could add that info to her voicemail 😂,2022-04-28 02:27:22
ud8vgz,And this is why I tip in cash so dickwads like you screw yourselves out your tips 🤷‍♂️,2022-04-27 20:24:47
ud8vgz,I bet the driver dropped a whole pizza box full of red flags! 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩NTAAAA,2022-04-27 23:55:45
ud8vgz,"Depends where you live. Tipping in the UK is not expected. Also when you use an app like JustEat, or Deliveroo, they add a delivery fee (which as you said, _should_ go to the driver who _delivers_ it - it’s right there in the name) 

But then they add a Service charge as well. It’s some bullshit to expect a tip _on top_ of that, imo…🤷🏼‍♀️",2022-04-28 15:22:52
ud8vgz,"My college roommate and I would set up our answering machine every month or so with a different variation of ""Hello, thektulu7 here. \[pause\] Well not here right now, this is just the answering machine.""

Once my roommate set it up where he attempted talking to the person, but I had some music going in the background. And he goes, ""Hang on, I can't really hear—hey thektulu7 can you turn it down a bit—"" and then I lowered the music volume and he goes, ""Alright so what were you saying? \[Pause\] Yeah so make sure you also tell me your callback number so I can reply later, this is the answering machine.""

We were such jerks 🤣

Edit: Hearing messages start with people in mid-sentence at the beep was always hilarious. I think once his sister called and she was rather peeved upon realizing, after a particularly lengthy prerecording he'd set up, that he'd heard none of it.",2022-04-28 12:03:46

yz23e0,For some reason I always thought restaurants would do better than fast food. But this Olive Garden made less than half of what my Pizza Hut makes on their worst days. And they probably get paid better and aren’t understaffed 😅,2022-11-19 15:04:44
yz23e0,"I work at a similar restaurant, and we print sales reports by the hour from the register. The next employee burdened with applying all of that to a spreadsheet helps generate our prep numbers for the next day. It's an entire waste of paper, but many POS systems don't retain information hour by hour, and that's what we need. 

I am the employee that inputs all that information. It doesn't take very long, but it feels like a stupid waste of time when anyone could do it. 😑",2022-11-19 05:51:50

As opposed to Celcius which simple states 0° as the freezing point of water and 100° as its boiling point.

zyfnar,Well done restaurant 👏 tired of parents thinkings its just fine to bring kids to dinner that they allow to run around and be loud. Im all for children in restaurants but i do believe it is the responsibility of the parents to know if their children are ready for it and to have empathy for the rest of the people in the restaurant. The whole “they are just kids” excuse really just covers bad parenting… many kids can be fine in restaurants. Signs like this are products of bad parents imo,2022-12-30 14:45:07

i36emn,"So originally when the Fender Japan opened, Fender took a very active role in their partnership with their original manufacturing partner (FujiGen). In 1996 Fender decided to step back to a much more hands-off approach and changed manufacturers to Tokai/Dyna.

Basically, the workmanship and quality of materials from FujiGen is superior quality to that of Tokai or Dyna. In fact, they stuck so strictly to the manufacturing specs, many people consider FujiGen-made ‘52 Reissue Telecasters (which mine is 😁) to be as close as you can get to an actual 1952 Tele (but for a fraction of the price). The only issue with that is they used components designed in ‘52 so due to about 35 years of wear and tear I had to replace the switch and output jack. But now she sounds as good as the day she was born. 

TL/DR: Way better quality in both craftsmanship and materials.",2020-08-04 03:59:07

I shopped for her in the boys section as well as the girls and when she got old enough to pick she did the same thing. She still shops in the men's section, as do I. Girls are ""allowed"" to do this. If you stop conforming, the norm will change. 

The real problem is the hypocrisy in it not being ok for boys to wear girls clothes. When that changes we will have a chance at some kind of agreement. Ideally that people can wear whatever they want without judgements, but I'm a little too cynical to think that could happen. We just need to be brave enough to dress our little boys in every choice of clothes, and the critics be damned. Collective agreement to refuse to gender our clothing choices. Stop conforming.

It was a field trip and we spent the first half of the day watching a video learning about safety; everything from how pedestrian walk signs and city streets work to what to do if you find a gun somewhere which was to “Stop! Don’t touch! Leave the area. Tell an adult” 😂 

Also the video was kid friendly and hosted by Jiminy Cricket so maybe it was made by Disney? 🤷🏼‍♂️ But Jiminy always started every scene with the song  🎶”I’m no fool no sirree; I’m gonna live to be 103” 🎶

qtv60h,Yup. I’ve been lucky enough to participate in this particular type of event.  It’s a completely different animal.  Totally different skill set.  I think it really lends itself to Saber. It’s not at all dissimilar to mounted combat.  I recommend it to anyone that gets the chance to fence in this manner.  You’ll get your eyes opened real quick. 😄,2021-11-15 07:02:52

Then you turn up, have to drop all your footwork, restrict yourself to being in a wheelchair for some reason, just so someone else can participate? 😂 Put Hot Rod in the handicapped division, it's what's most fair for everybody. It's lose-lose for your wife getting matched up with somebody who can't walk properly. I'm sure she has a heart of gold but its a competition. She's not there to make other peoples dreams come true.

I've worn glasses since I was 4, and everyone is used to seeing me with them. Which is why it throws people for a loop when I show up without glasses sometimes and seem to have no problems. I am near sighted but usually have no problem making out most objects far away, reading text far away is the only thing I consistently have trouble with (which means driving without glasses or prescription sunglasses is a strict no-no) 

I've had people accuse me of wearing fake glasses and saying the lenses don't actually have any power.... Until I handle my glasses and they complain I've given them a headache now.... There's no winning sometimes 🤷",2021-11-14 23:25:48

qtv60h,"I mean, if the actual competitors were cool with it, Reddit voicing complaints is uncalled for. Reddit has a habbit of running with whatever narrative it perceives, and more often than not that's outrage regardless of how accurate that might be.

They need to consider it from the disabled person's perspective - Wheelchair bound and interested in fencing. It's incredible that able-bodied competitors are willing to play this way and include disabled competitors in the sport. Things would be pretty miserable for the wheelchair bound player if they could only compete against other disabled opponents who are likely few and far between.

bicy0u,"Yeah I read a similar article about the water used for production in several consumer goods!
It's absolutely nuts! I really avoid buying or getting bottled water unless I'm in a place where that's the only place to drink water at all.
Tap water even tastes much better 😌

Now, I'm not trying to be a pessimist. I love it when somebody come up with new ways we can make out products or habits more sustainable. But sometimes the best choice is less obvious, which is what makes this area (sustainable products) so darn difficult!
Although the bottle in the OP looks likes great idea I think it's a terrible idea. Maybe it was made of cardboard before and it wasn't made of recycled materials. But at least before the plastic bottle could be recycled 100% as the plastic that it was as it consisted of 100% plastic (usually ABS, PLA or maybe even HDPE depending on what purpose they have - sometimes the lid is also a diff material).
But now when it's 66% cardboard (recycled or not) with plastic liner inside then it becomes a mixer product and because the two materials are glued or fused together they become incredibly hard to sort or separate, which means that it's either A) recycled as cardboard which downcycles the cardboard purity and quality as it is mixed with plastic or it will more likely be B) sorted into disposable trash which is being incenerated (for energy) which emits a lot of greenhouse gases.
Even if it was plastic before is was still a better material to use as it could be recycled without downcycling or being burnt.
Yes we need to get away from using so much plastic, but we need to move to solutions that makes more sense. (Recycled) Cardboard might sound sustainable, but it might as well be less so than plastic, it's all about how it's produced and how it's disposed of..

bicy0u,That is quite eco friendly! They have their own reusable dispenser which is pretty cool. The cost of their detergent $10 for 33 loads is okay. $20/yr really isn’t much considering I have amazon prime 😅 and I’m sure the cost of free shipping and gifts already out price the membership.

bicy0u,"Living in Europe for some years now, most countries are way more ahead in terms of sustainability than the US. But with restaurant water, 1) public amenities are often paid (like toilets) and 2) it’s special in a restaurant, especially if you get bubbly water. Where I live, I don’t see much bottled water except for carbonated.

i7xwek,"Oh snap.  Story time. 

I was a really bad flirt in HS and had a crush on this girl in art class. 

I'd pound my hand on the table next to her whole she was drawing every once in awhile and tell her to not mess up. Well.... It was working! 

So good in fact that she came over one day to do the same to me! The only problem was, I was in the middle of some intense stippling and I had left all my colored pencils pointing up.... 

Her hand came down like this 👋 and she stuck herself on the meaty side of your hand by your pinkie. I looked over, stunned, and just let go of the pencils. 

When she pulled her hand up, the pencil was sticking in her hand with a purpose. She, in her shock, pulled the pencil out of her hand and ran out the door. 

No more flirty art class for me....",2020-08-11 21:49:05

Wir hatten die Bücher alle ummantelt mit einer Farbe so dass man das Cover nicht sehen konnte und die Farbe stand für in welchem Alter man anfangen kann, die auszuleihen. Ich war am Ende der 4ten Klasse und wollte Bram Stoker’s Dracula haben, musste aber warten bis Anfang der 5ten. Bin da am ersten neuen Schultag hin. Weiß noch genau, 4te Klasse hatte rote Mantel und 5te Dunkelblau. 

Meine Mutter war ihr ganzes Leben lang Bibliothekarin, studiert und alles, und ist vor ein paar Jahren in Rente gegangen, Bibliotheken sind wunderbar. 😊",2022-03-25 16:54:42

tnkq8q,"Not using a desktop anymore outside of work rings so true. I used to be glued to my computer screen most hours of the day, if not for tinkering with the OS (Windows ME, you get it) then for playing video games or doing general computer stuff and internet. I have not switched on my private laptop for 6 months because my phone can do anything I need on a daily basis and even at work all I need a laptop for is as periphery to print something on the office printer. And I’m fine with that. Wild. 

I used to hang around Ars Technica too! Had email alerts for articles on topics I was interested in too lol. Could not be bothered for any of that now, especially since it’s so easy to curate your internet experience and social media to what you care about and only that. And very importantly, the amount of emails I get now on a daily basis is directly connected to my happiness and my happiness is highest when that number is zero. 🤣",2022-03-25 17:23:48

z0oo4h,We've had this in Australia for ages. You can still call an ambulance whenever you need and they send you a bill a couple months later. The problem is that bill is $800-$1k. You can pay around $100 a year to get this same cover. So if you make at least 1 ambulance call every 7-8 years then that's a decent discount! 😅,2022-11-21 07:02:13
z0oo4h,"This is a normal thing in Australia, at least here in my city.

If you find yourself in an emergency and need an ambulance, you will get an invoice a month or two later costing 1-1.5k (maybe more depending on severity of situation).

If you pay 100$ for a yearly cover, you will not have to pay  said fee if you need an ambulance ride. Unlimited uses apparently. 

I still remember being like 12 years old and I got an official letter addressed to me for an ambulance bill and seeing it was about 1k. Split second there I thought I was gonna have to sell my soul but thankfully my parents paid for it 😅",2022-11-21 06:35:18

Every single thing you wrote here is false.

And FYI, non-emergencies absolutely block ambulances, and to you other readers out there: Don't ever believe otherwise. They already are absolutely destroying ERs and EMS.

The solutions being proposed by you and 99.9% of the comments show a total lack of contextual knowledge on how EMS operates and is funded in the US, and because of that I honestly wouldn't even know where to begin to start explaining why what you're suggesting just couldn't happen.

107rhg9,"Yes, but also no?

At a federal level, abortion isn't protected.

The US has 50 states and each state is free to legislate how they please (even if a federal law is present, a state can ""choose"" not to follow it but there are usually consequences).

Consider the US as 50 countries with open borders and use the same currency while also being in rough agreement with each other.

Our political system has devolved from being a healthy multi-party system to a two party system, as such the population has also largely split it's views into two extremes with a middle-ground of individuals whom maintain sanity.

In short, abortion might require jumping through more hoops depending on the state an individual is in and or not even be available to you unless certain circumstances arise and the right to an abortion has devolved into what is effectively ""clear as mud"" laws so some healthcare institutions are even afraid to do it when it's a medical emergency.

A lot of this is because one particular political party is compromised of religious zealots that somehow in a country where in it's bill of rights there is supposed to be a separation of church and state... that has ceased to somehow be the case and religion is playing an every increasing importance to the decisions our state leadership and congress are making.

...

I have become comfortable with myself that if my wife were to somehow suffer an incident that would require an abortion and the procedure couldn't be done to save her life, unspeakable things would happen to the powers that be.

So let us hope this doesn't happen because unlike most I am fairly comfortable in my ability to plan and execute such a thing. 😊",2023-01-10 15:23:15

ag9wn9,"In terms of usefulness, I’d bet you could also make a great bonfire out of them! /s

(I’m new here—did I use the sarcasm “/s” correctly?) 

But seriously:  I realize you’ve already explained your expertise re: things book-related in your ‘edit,’ and there are many book experts (I’m not one) out there, and other views of this. 

I am in the camp of not disrespecting printed writings bc of....well, w your background you must be familiar w the history of destruction of books and writings and documentation over time....usually not so great. 

I mean no disrespect to your project and I realize it must be bc you love books of course !! 

Perhaps you could use dust jackets over wood pieces to make these? That way you advertise the books without eliminating these copies from circulation!?

I am just sensitive to how this silences the voices that became furniture....

I have never written a book....but if I saw that my hours of work (at the very least), and perhaps my heart and soul and life’s passion and sacrifices of more lucrative options, as well as possibly partially neglected relationships and/or standing with family/friends and/or peers ended up in being a piece of furniture, I suspect that feels humiliating and embarrassing. Possibly worse. 

And bc of your job you also know this is the story of many writers who were actually famous and praised, so I can only imagine how lesser-known authors may feel.

Obviously, I’m a lover of books. 
And when I come across one I do not like, I donate it—thrift store, title IX schools, homeless or women’s shelters, etc.—So many others (who can never or will never come to the awesome sales of excess books at libraries) may benefit from what’s in your furniture. ❤️

Would you consider using jackets and not actual books next time?  tbh, I would love having a piece that looked like this, if there were not real books trapped in there—OR—you could make it but with little shelves where one could take/replace books?

Thank you for considering my concerns about books!

—Sincerely,
Another lover of books

TLDR: Looks cool, is there another way? 😊

81vbq9,"I'm not an art critic, and I am definitely not ""into"" that scene, but I think I understand what he's doing. When I saw the ps controller all cracked up and fossilized I pictured an archeologist in the year 3018 discovering it and hypothesising about it's purpose to the ancient civilization that created it.

I think that's the point, though. Art is meant to be interpreted and is subjective by nature. People thought Picasso was batshit, called him all sorts of names, but today his originals sell for millions if they can be had. 

Even if you don't like it, it's obvious he puts in a lot of work into his creations. If even a few people are impacted by his work then he's succeeded. Personally, I think it's fuckin sweet! 🐐

Edit: If you’ve never heard the word “unhoused” instead of homeless, [here](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/homeless-unhoused) is an article discussing language used to discuss the crisis of homelessness.

A week later she Cashapp’d me $150 and asked if I could buy her a good sleeping bag, a propane space heater, a carne asada burrito with salsa verde and a large Dr Pepper.

tfrlyo,"Half our town burned down last September in a wildfire- we lost one of the three schools in the district I teach in, 1/3 of my students lost their home, and 2 teachers I work with lost the homes they lived in for 30+ years. One of those teachers i work closely with, she teaches special Ed and I teach middle school math/science. She’s been living in a small trailer since then with her husband, daughter, and 4 dogs. All she has is a portable DVD player and she was telling me that she’s watched the only 3 dvds she has over and over and has nothing else. So I went around the school and around town asking for dvd donations and put together a big basket of movie snacks and dvds for her and she was so happy. They’re not obsolete, you may have the perfect opportunity some day to make someone’s day 💕",2022-03-17 04:09:42
tfrlyo,"Don’t feel bad. I once had a similar collection of over 1000 VHS tapes, that I paid a fortune for btw. (Average price: $35 per tape). Finally got tired of lugging around all the heavy crates of movies and put them all up for grabs on “free stuff” on craigslist. Got an immediate response from someone, who coincidentally turned out to be my neighbor who lived in the back half of the duplex I lived in at the time. Didn’t even have to transport them! Have consoled myself since then by building up a “digital library” of over 1,000 films, including many of the VHS titles I gave away, that all fit on one 5TB hard drive (that I maintain several copies of) 😉",2022-03-17 04:10:56

oizi2b,"It really is a shame the europeans seemed to have such a bad superiority complex that they could not see the value of these native people. I unfortunately don't think that is a foreign concept in any culture/region though, pretty sure most people have at least some form of superiority complex to other people. Like we are being opressed by evil white guys, but at least we're better than Chinese people, I dunno, something like that. Always be careful not to listen to it too much, it usually doesn't result in anything good.

On a completely different note, I always associated flint and arrowheads and other such tools with periods so increadibly long ago, like stoneage/prehistory, thousands of years ago. It is so amazing these people used those technologies still so much later. I wish there were still many people able to knap flint, but it seems difficult. At least where I live the flint is expensive to difficult to get and the techniques require lots of practice to learn, so yeah, not the best combination for a new hobby 😅",2021-07-13 06:51:12

q7i0gz,"I re-discovered the library after having a kid and taking her two story times. 

Now I go to the library more for myself than my kids 😂

Not just books! Technology!

I get all my music, video games, and wifi from the library. 

I cancelled my Spotify subscription. If I hear a song I like, I get the CD from the library and copy it. It may take a little more time, but little by little over the years now I have a fuckin' awesome music library. 

I get all my Xbox One and Switch games from the library. It is kinda annoying if it's due back in a week and I need to wait for another copy to come in, but between mine and my wife's cards I always have a back-up copy of whatever game I'm playing ready. 

THE BEST PART - my library is in a network with all the other libraries in the entire metropolitan area, so if we don't have it, chances are another library will and they'll ship it over. For free. The network is huge. 

Also, I work in the field, away from an office. There's no desk, printer, internet where I work. So I get a wifi hotspot from the library and now I can sit in my car and have access to email, everything I need on my laptop in my car. My coworker drives all the way back to the main office everyday to submit his paperwork. Not me 😊

I save $10 / mo. on music, $60 / game, and get free internet all from my library. It's fuckin awesome.",2021-10-14 01:42:25

One of my favorite spots is the 3D printing area that's off to the side of the kids interactive area. My nephew was enraptured just watching a 3D printer make an iron man helmet hahaha.

njfssi,"I worked at a pet store in a mall when I was in high school. I fell in love with this snake we got in, maybe 18” when it arrived. I planned to buy it on my next payday, we took him off the floor and I got his tank all set up at home. Well the day I went to get him, he had gotten out and was loose somewhere in the mall. We got a call from CVS (in the same mall) over a year later that there was a snake in their stock room and it was him. That sucker had grown to almost 5 feet in that time! He must’ve had some good eating 😬🐀",2021-05-24 02:31:49

As I'm finishing up, I happen to look over and see a water Moccasin. It was about 20 inches from my arm. (Thankfully I was prepared with a long sleave shirt that day because it was raining out.)
I gently, slowly and very very very carefully, backed the F%<£ up out from underneath my Camaro and checked to see if I had any bite marks and check my pants for stains 💩 😂",2021-05-24 04:45:30

njfssi,"I took a trip to Florida (from CA) once, me and my brother found one of these slithering through the grass. We always caught critters our whole life, so we were excited to see/catch whatever we could. Anyway, I grabbed it by the tail and realized that thing was almost 6ft long!! We were convinced it was a black mamba 😂😅 but after some research (and common sense) we realized it was just a black rat snake, so we wrapped it in a shirt and let it go about half a mile away. 
 We were in a pretty crowded/populated area so we didn't want to release it around the houses and have someone hurt it.
 We proceeded to look up all venomous/poisonous critters in Florida, just in case.",2021-05-23 21:19:43

I noticed you dropped 4 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

gmv1jy,"Aussie here. My wife recently gave birth to our first. We went through the public system and she ended up spending 4 nights on hospital due to complications. The birthing suite was huge with jet bath, aromatherapy, our choice of music piped in. She tried to forego drugs but had an epidural in the end. We had a midwife right up until the delivery when things got complicated and about a billion doctors came in and took over.

Afterwards she had a private room with a big window, free meals from a full menu and even a woman who came in twice a day to massage her feet (we were both suitably shocked). I walked out of the hospital having paid exactly $0. Literally the only thing we paid for was parking.

I'll never forget my grandfather, a WW2 vet, talking about how the Americans came to help Oz during the war. You guys deserve a better system. Good luck with bub - I hope it all goes super smooth for you 😊",2020-05-20 04:21:41

mt3itx,I can't believe after 2020 that toilets still exist without bidets.  Irregardless of the toilet paper shortage it's so so much more sanitary.  How are all you non bidet types ok with smearing shit around and then just cover it with your underwear?   Even if you have a hairless perfect butthole (which I doubt most do simply based on other hygiene standards) it's disgusting.   And if you're as unkept as your neckline or eyebrows like holy fuck.  Y'all enjoy walking around with chunky peanut butter?   How does it not just stink?  Shit stains 🤢 .

oxr408,"If the window is in the room you slept in, you might want to get the bat tested for rabies. Unfortunately that’s not good news for the bat, but where I live (NC), animal control encourages us to get rabies shots if we are unconscious in a room with a bat, if they can’t catch it and have it tested. ☹️",2021-08-04 12:28:18

oxr408,"Had a situation like this some years ago when we left a window open for an hour or so.  I was sitting in my son’s room (who was a baby/young toddler at this point) and we were watching TV.  I noticed a dark spot in the corner towards the ceiling and thought that the wall had a hole in it.  I walked close and I saw the fur and leathery wings and turned around, grabbed my son, and ran out and slammed the door.

Animal control was costing money so I went in there (preparing for battle) and whacked it with a stick and it fell off the wall into a plastic bin and then I disposed of it.  I normally don’t like to hurt animals unnecessarily but I was pretty freaked (real masculine, I know😅).

After a couple hours I started thinking about rabies and how it had been in the house overnight and ended up taking my son and i to the ER.  They recommended we get the bat tested so we didn’t have to get all the shots and we ended up having to pay animal control anyway (plus an “after hours” fee on top of the original).  Thankfully it came back negative but was definitely something I hope not to be dealing with again anytime soon.",2021-08-04 16:24:54

oxr408,"The first year we bought our house in the country, in the summer a bat got in the house (we suspect it was through a rip in the enclosed porch screen I ended up replacing). My daughter wakes us up at like 11pm and says “There’s a BAT in the house and the cat is trying to get it!”

Sure enough, there’s a bat flying around and our cat leaping in the air trying to get it. My gf calmly grabs a trash bag and dustpan from the upstairs bathroom, catches it in the bag, and puts the bag on the floor. I can hear it chittering really fast. 

Then she repeatedly smacks the bag with the dustpan and I’m like 🤨😧😯. No more chittering. 

She straight up murdered that bat with a quickness.",2021-08-04 19:05:33

oxr408,"Sh&t Man! I'm 26 and I didn't knew all those facts about rabies. When I was 8, more or less, in Argentina I found a bat in front of my house. It was around noon and was very hot, he looked death because was layed in the hot cement of the street. A couple of friends were playing football like 600m away from ma 🏠 so I decided to carry up the lil dude to show it to my friends! 

Once I arrived there I noticed that little ffkn cute bat has bitten me and was licking/sucking my blood man!!!! Soon I learned that they have some stuff like the mosquitos and you don't feel the pain of their bite. I was lucky I didn't contracted rabies or stuff man !!! LoL 🦂",2021-08-04 19:55:47

oxr408,"Speaking of birds

We had fruits on the basket in the kitchen, and they'll be fine in the morning but sometimes, in the afternoon, they have some hole and the whole side starts rotting. They weren't gonna be eaten though, to be fed off (else we keep it in the kitchen because of the heat and most and ants)

One Saturday late morning, everyone in the living room, we saw the culprits: we often get mynahs visiting, they sit on the bamboo stands outside and chirp to each other or swear at us, or sometimes a pair comes and they look awkwardly and one jumps onto the other and do the deed 🤭

Ye back to Saturday morning. We heard scuffing noise in the kitchen. We lean back and we saw it - two mynahs, so daringly, in the kitchen. One on the floor eating the leftover bread crusts from the bin (yes pls forgive my young crust-hating self) and another all the way to the other side of the kitchen, picking the fruits. But not eating them. Just poke poke. We don't know how they knew we had fruits in there.

So a few days of chasing them off and closing the windows when unguarded, and they learnt their lessons

Also a cute incident were three juvenile mynahs were playing with each other at the front corridor upstairs, and they heard a distant thunder and bolted down in shock. But one of them got bumped and instead of flying straight down, it flew inwards into my level's corridor parapet railing. There was a loud Thongggg sound and the bird was on the corridor floor, belly up, sitting slump, legs lay straight, wings on the side. Poor fella, I could almost make out the looney toons stars spinning around the hairless yellow head of this black mynah. About a few seconds in, it shook its head, popped back up on its legs, regained its bearings and lunged atop the railing before diving off

I felt the second-hand oof.",2021-08-04 15:18:24

doku3k,"Since everyone is obviously very concerned with this building, let me drop some facts for you. 

1) we did not spend one dollar on this. We had all materials donated by a construction site my bf was working for. 

2) we live in a town of 20 people and have no neighbours. No such thing as building permits. Or shitty nosey ass people worried about what the fuck I’m doing. Mind ya business. 

3) my view from my house is a mountain. You think I’m concerned with the way a fucking dog house looks?!!  Nope. 

4) I have 5 dogs and they are inside dogs. This is for playtime. 

5) it’s easy to clean because my dogs are not fucking barbarians and don’t shit and piss on every possible surface. 

6) these aren’t chep pallets you morons. The company painted them blue for a purpose and was going to burn them before we grabbed them. 

7) the whole house is completely insulted. No wind or rain can enter. 

8) it is structurally sound. It has held 5 dogs and 5 people. 

9) my boyfriend is not a carpenter(he’s a truck driver/equipment operator) CLEARLY but the fact he built this by himself just for dogs is impressive. 

10) come fucking paint it yourself if you are so worried. My dogs don’t care and neither do I

Nice corrections are nice.

And I do think most comments said it nicely but I'm sad so many people are piling on that and we're not getting more comments and compliments about her skill.  

So what if you accidentally named an incorrect source and thought it was her teachers?!  

It was nice for some people to set the record straight.  And give you more insight into your personal history.

But you obviously accidentally tapped into a crowd with too much time on their hands and not enough simple *appreciation.*  I didn't think it was so rough in mildlyinteresting!  Shame on them.

I'm still surprised it got so crazy!

Like I said, a gentle correction is normal and understandable, and I appreciated the initial contribution of facts.

But I don't know WHAT happened here, today.  

When I came in, there were ENOUGH top comments talking about Dickens that it became obvious that many assholes piled on.  And still more assholes starting new posts questioning you about Dickens.

I kept scrolling looking for a nice post about the sketches, maybe asking more about you and your Grandma!

I know there's plenty of reddit subs full of jerks.   Didn't think it would happen in r/mildlyinteresting!  😂

Just don't bother with anyone talking about Dickens, anymore.  You've apologized and explained more than enough.

I'm sure many people like me enjoyed it and would love more.  I'm trying to think of another sub....  I'll DM or start a chat if I think of one.

I think it's just important to note it's all just channels when it's on the fibre. By the time you're rolling out a huge network (metro/national) of fibre, your installation costs are so high (respective to media cost) that youre likely to be running large bundles of fibre. The more strands, the more sets of channels you've got at your disposal.

I'd assume having a sense of direction in a fibre can make things easier to repeat mid-span. Say you've a 48 fibre bundle, nominating 24 in each direction  means you can just repeat all wavelengths forward in one direction.

If you've got limited exisiting fibres, then bidi or just dropping a full blown multi-channel WDM across it would get the job done.",2021-03-09 17:29:12

To get to the fourth floor if you are disabled you must:

▪ Go up a ramp



▪Up a flight of stairs


▪ Take an elevator to the third floor 


▪ Find the balcony (Going out of the building to get into the same fucking building because the floors arent connected normally!)


▪Up two flights of stairs to another balcony



▪Go back into the building 





Congratulations you are now on the fourth floor now just wash rinse and repeat for the whole semester!  >:(

aw39wi,"I'm not rich, not affiliated wit any of the mongoloid parties, and definitely not a member of the elite '200 families' or the 400 Italian families, 56 Austrian and so on (It's funny and kinda adorable to me that you seem to think that that is only a Croatian thing 🤗).

Have you ever actually tried running a small business here, or are you just pulling things out of your ass? 🤣😂🤣

We do not in fact have the highest taxes in the EU, and our country isn't comprised of murderers and rapists as you seem to imply! Murders are actually really rare here. One of the lowest of all of the EU!

Marihuana and cocaine have absolutely no impact on MS, some studies actually show adverse effects. Also you have the same things happening in Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain... But you somehow seem to think it only happens in Croatia? My dear boy...

Please do go live in some other countrie for a while so you can get some perspective, because currently, you're living in a bubble.",2019-03-01 15:40:27

My last two drive through trips lasted like 40 minutes for the first one and 1 hour and 15 mins for the second visit, and they literally fucked both orders up. I’m a sucker for waiting in the drive-thru that long TWICE. Their speaker was broken so they were taking orders at the window instead of in the drive thru lane, so they were doing one order at a time and then cooking and serving it before taking the next order and cooking that. What’s crazy is they had a restaurant FULL of people but nobody knew what the Fuck they were doing 🤣🤦‍♂️ I miss Popeyes so much and it’s only 15 minutes away but I said I’d never go back there",2022-12-13 01:30:13

k3b1mc,"Back when I was in jr. high, I had to do a project where I drew a movie poster for a novel I read. I chose The Hobbit (this was in 2007, years before it became a trilogy), and at the bottom of the poster, I put ""In Theatres November 31"" as a sort of tongue-in-cheek jab at the fact that it isn't an actual movie ad. Since then, whenever I wanted to give something a fake release date, I'd always put November 31. It could never be September because the saying goes ""30 Days Hath September..."", meaning that ""September 31"" would be immediately recognizable as fake. It also couldn't be February, April, or June because for some reason, it's easier to remember that those three months don't have 31 days. But November? It's sandwiched between the two full months of October and December, which somehow gives it the appearance of being their equal. Thus, I determined that November 31 is the nonexistent date with the highest likelihood of tricking people at first glance. 😏",2020-11-29 23:19:46

Not at all, actually. If I did I wouldn't be giving you such a hard time about getting one word wrong. Your English is excellent. Better than most natives IMO. Don't sweat the one word mistake.

And I get the rest of your point. It's just fun to argue. I can see both sides of the argument, but yet one more counterpoint: if we suggest that Nov 31 is such a non existent date that nothing can fall either before or after it... then we have to accept that the food will never expire, but will also never be non-expired (since we can't determine if we are before a nonexistent date).

Colonizers only recognize one thing & that's violence. That's when they give you attention.  They should've went the Filipino route.

u3ilez,">The boy who cried Adolf - Children's book 2

Um....

EDIT: OH MY GOD IT GETS SO MUCH WORSE 🤣🤣🤣

#Are you sick of liberals propagandizing our kids into a hypocritical emotion-based ideology? So are we.

This is a retelling of the well-known children's tale, The Boy Who Cried Wolf. Whereas the original story taught the reader to be cautious about raising false alarms, this version focuses on the more modern issues of social justice and virtue signaling. While it may seem to some that someone with a differing point of view or lifestyle you don't agree with is evil; calling someone a Nazi and trying to persecute them for their beliefs will get you punched in the face... This is real life, not the internet.

The simple fact of the matter is:

1. Believing in capitalism doesn't make you a Nazi.

2. Exercising one's 2nd Amendment Rights doesn't make them a racist.

3. Having a different opinion on political issues doesn't make you evil. 

4. Trying to dictate how others live makes you the Nazi. 

In The Boy Who Cried Adolf, our character learns these simple truths the hard way.  

#Warning, this book contains physical violence. If you are trying to raise your child into a blubbering feminist cuck with purple highlights in their hair, this book is not for you.

u3ilez,Lmfao that’s hilarious 😂 💀,2022-04-14 16:26:21
u3ilez,"""assault rifle"" and ""assault weapons"" are two very different things.

Assault rifles are full auto and chambered in an intermediate cartridge. The only way to legally buy one is to find a transferable one from before the machine gun ban in 1986 and it will cost more than $20,000. Nobody is buying an assault rifle for home defence or because the feel threatened. They are buying it because it's fun to shoot, and is a good collectors item.

""assault weapon"" is a made up anti-gun term used to confuse uninformed individuals such as yourself into believing every gun is a babymurdered 9000™

The truth is the vast majority of firearms owned in the US have never, and will never be used in a life or death situation. There are literally thousands of different models of firearm designed exclusively for sporting and recreational shooting. Even the ar15 which the anti-gun folks like the hoist up as the ultimate ""military wannabe murder weapon"" was designed exclusively for and sold exclusively to the civilian market as a sporting rifle for more than a decade before the US military adopted a modified version as a stopgap measure while they designed a new standard issue rifle. (Those designs fell through, so they stuck with the AR as the basis for their platform.)

I own 7 guns, 1 Of them is specifically meant as a home defence gun on the one in a million chance someone tries to fuck around and subsequently finds out. All 7 of them have never been used for anything other then recreational shooting, even though 3 of them were literally designed to kill people in war (old ww2 rifles).",2022-04-15 05:42:50

u3ilez,"If anyone needs an extra wtf, [here](https://youtu.be/n6vvUpEFsYg)‘s a reading of the book. Yikes!

>‘First, the boy came across a sheepherder. The sheepherder had a rifle slung on his back.’

>’Without another word, the boy began screaming, ‘Nazi! There’s a Nazi here!’

>	‘That’s not a Nazi! It’s just Frank.’

>’He is a Nazi,’ replied the boy, ‘he owns a gun instead of relying on the government to protect him.’

>…He overheard the woman say, ‘I think partial-birth abortions are cruel’…

>’Nazi! There’s a Nazi here! Nazi! Nazi! Nazi!’ … ‘I just overheard her say that she hates women’s rights!’

>…at that moment, one villager punched the boy square in the jaw. ‘There, you happy now, boy? Mind your mouth, and you won’t get your face smashed in. This is real life, not the Internet.’

cl3j6g,"Yes, if you make floor from anything else, it will tipple onto it's side when (non-laminar flowing) wind velocities exceed 60 knots (when at a perfectly perpendicular angle of attack in relation to the floor).

Different floor surfacing materials have no effect on this phenomenon, although the porousness of the material *does* especially  in cases of floors with large gaps and openings, (e.g. decking, [poltholing](https://polthole.floormaterials/what-is-a-poltholed-floor-used-for?NSA_TRACKER=""reddit""), and metal grating).

The turbularism (≈ï) of the wind has [a striking effect](https://science.smartness/pbthtpbhththth) on the geometric variables related to overall floor stability.

Turbulent wind is caused by [n-LORB eddying](https://n-LORB.eddy/FAQ), which we are only now beginning to understand on a macroscopic level due to breakthroughs in nanoscale n-LORB metrology.

Perfectly perpendicular, laminar-flowing wind (or [PPLFW](https://pplfw.tradeunion/abbr) if you're part of the flooring industry) can knock a floor onto it's side with as little as 20 knots (roughly equivalent to 34,000 horsesneezepower).

It is currently unknown whether or not the varying coefficient of friction due to floor walk-wear has any bearing on the overall tipplepoint, though most recent meta-analytical flooring substrate studies seem to agree that the data collected thus far are  probably insufficient to draw any real conclusions; though I expect research to continue over the next three years (in large part due to an influx of funding from the micropolthole flooring lobby).

Hopefully we'll have a much better idea of what surfacing options are best for their (potential) anti-tipple properties within the next decade.

tl;dr: We still don't know if Tipplepoint Floorplane Spray®© really works as a laminarity barrier against the high tipplepoint of anticlockwise tornadoes, or if the infomercials are merely leveraging simple nanolaminar gusset flows across the micropolthole layer to create the illusion of constant-floor stability.",2019-08-02 16:01:48

I noticed you dropped 4 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

HR staff took me there to make the introduction (because who would actually believe me if I just showed up and asked for the keys and weapon), so I absent-mindedly followed them through this huge hospital to the inmate's room. 

I was relieved by another staff member when my shift was over and thought I could remember my way back to the parking garage.

I'm not even exaggerating when I say that I walked around that freaking place for nearly 45 minutes trying different doors that looked like I could get to the outside world! They were all locked! I was in panic mode, because I ended up in a closed wing (I think), and I swear it felt like I was in a post-apocalyptic movie. Finally found what appeared to be a janitor's entrance door and stumbled out into the light. It was on the opposite side of the hospital from my car. 🤦‍♀️",2022-05-03 10:08:17

uh2xhb,"I'm at the gym right now but when I have time I'll edit this comment and detail some of my experiences. Don't let the suspense fool you, the stories probably aren't that fascinating LMAO



edit: 

So my first job, as a 17 year old community college student mind you, was a delivery driver for a pizza place. I ended up losing that position because I backed into a parked car in a dark cul de sac 💀. They gave me the option of doing some back of house stuff (getting dough ready for the next day, cleaning, answering phones etc.) which was posed as an alternative to just being terminated. Easy choice, I get to keep a job so I went along with it.

I was pretty good, but that was because it was fairly mindless work most of the time. After maybe two to three months I was given the offer of promoting to shift lead.

Naturally, young and naive, I took the offer and proceeded to experience what has ultimately become my worst job I've had so far (24 now so it's been a little under 7 years since I quit this job). 

It was a fairly small store and it was a chain place so they decided that they'd give the store a skeleton crew for the employee roster to make up for low projected profits. The problem with this is that the delivery area for our store was set up in a way that we covered mostly industrial properties and office blocks, which meant consistent bulk orders throughout the day at random times. 

So we'd be running pretty smoothly with maybe me and two drivers, and then out of nowhere we're up to our eyeballs in orders with not enough people. It was constant tension because you just knew that screen would light up. 

That's not really the problem I had with it, that's just the kind of chaos you have to get comfortable with (or as close to comfortable as you can get, at least). One of the main problems I had is the schedule. It was only written for the week of, as profit forecast was unpredictable or something. I don't know why but it made it hard to plan things with friends or even just for myself for the next week because I wouldn't know when I'd have time yet. And to request days off it had to be two or three weeks out from the date you're requesting. 

That in itself was bad enough, but I had no job experience so I didn't realize how shitty that really was. To even further drive the point of how unaware I was, the schedule also kind of meant nothing. Often times I'd be called in on days off, sometimes with less than an hour of when I'd need to be there. And on days I was scheduled, I'd be asked to come in early and stay late etc. I knew I could say no but again, it was my first job so I felt guilty saying no. Like I was betraying the ""team"". 

After a few months of that, I eventually grew weary and considered submitting my two weeks. I wasn't too sure if it was time to leave yet, but the thought was there. The thing that actually pushed me over the edge of jumping ship happened at one of the weekly shift lead meetings.

Of course it began quite standard, going over tasks for the weak and direction from the store manager. However after the meeting I was pulled aside by the store manager and was notified that one of the other shift leads has accused me of coming into work baked (???) and while she does not personally believe it she still wanted to let me know that the accusations were there. 

I eventually found out who it was from one of my other coworkers and it ended up being someone I thought had no issues with me, I certainly had no issues with him.

That was it for me. Put my two weeks in at the end of the night, handwritten. Had no energy to deal with weird workplace drama on top of everything else.

For the record, I never came into work high except for a couple times and that was when I was still just a prep person in the back of the store. But after I put my two weeks in, I came in stoned like a biblical whore every single night that I worked and proceeded to get better numbers and reviews than that punk bitch in the process.",2022-05-03 01:54:23

I think.   I’m sure it’s possible, however I doubt there were less emissions by using those goats versus sending a couple guys back there with some line trimmers.

I was even considering rehoming them because I couldn't deal with it. Then I heard a ridiculous banging sound in the middle of the night and walked into my Florida room to see a strange cat throwing itself at the windows in succession in a panic. My poor cats were on high ground just looking bemused when usually they are territorial. 

Any how, cat door gone, cats entirely inside now, and no further issues.

(We also got dead birds, live birds, an opossum (but that was cute), and a live baby squirrel while we had a cat door. I'm now a proponent of indoor only cats and a donator to my local wildlife refuge. 😬)",2019-05-24 21:48:24

gzb21s,"Actually, it *does* vary from State to State. People have been arguing over trees, _and using them for property boundaries_ since the beginning of time. 🤔

In Tennessee, you are allowed to trim back a neighbors trees or shrubbery back to the boundary line. Unless the tree _is on the boundary_ - then _neither of you are allowed to harm it_ unless you're both in agreement. Falling live trees and branches are always considered Acts of God, and nobody is liable for anything, aside from cleaning up their own property. If it falls into your property, it's yours - fruit, leaves, sticks, and trees. You can _possibly_ argue liability over a dead-standing tree, which was located where it is a clear danger.

My favorite part: *triple damages* if you harm your neighbor's trees. I've even seen this successfully applied where utility companies overzealously protected their easements. 😂",2020-06-09 03:42:27

There are likely multiple genes that cause polydactyl so it’s unlikely we would’ve had the same mutation, especially since it sounds like you don’t have other markers. 

My mutation is unfortunately dominant which means my kids have a 50/50 shot at inheriting it. I didn’t know about it until age 24 when I went to a decently famous hospital here in the US for unrelated reasons and they became interested in my medical history and did genetic testing.

Your perspective on menu costs adjusts pretty rapidly that first day you sit down at your executive chef position and open a bill from the natural gas company for fifteen thousand dollars.

For one month.

The wages, leasing, financing, insurance, shipping contract fees, and utilities all cost the same. Deducting one less egg, bacon rasher, and pancake doesn't really make much of a dent.

Menu prices include the cost of having a literal army of people exist for the sole purpose of serving you food you didn't have to prepare, and get waited on hand and foot by literal human beings.

They don't actually *want* you to order the ladies' meal, it's just there in case you're not a caloric monstrosity.",2023-02-23 03:31:21

j54xj4,"Yes, this used to be common in some older houses plus, even moreso, people having cedar chests.

When I was in high school, some of my friends and I got invited to a college toga party.  We were juniors or seniors, so it wouldn't be too big a deal to tell my Mom I was going to a local college party.

But I just frikkin knew if I said it was a ""toga party,"" that would cross the line and she'd say no way.  My other friends were in the same boat, and all of us trying to figure out how to sneak a sheet out of the house.  Then one friend said, ""My Grandma has a whole chest of sheets she never even uses, I'll just grab enough for everyone.""  Cool.

And that's how we ended up going to a toga party all strongly smelling of **cedar.**

Yes, it was noticed.  😂",2020-10-05 01:58:41

osng1u,woah! i wonder if some kids would like the taste and eat more 😭,2021-07-27 22:27:07
osng1u,They should make them sweet so the kids will eat them. Then they can harvest the children’s bodies and create super powered rocket fuel which will save global warming and cut down the population at the same time. I’ve got a boner just thinking about the scientific possibilities. 🥵🥵🥵,2021-07-28 00:23:07

osng1u,Do 9volts have a taste or is that just electricity? Bc 9 volts taste bad 😂,2021-07-27 17:06:45
osng1u,I swallowed one of the smaller button batteries as a kid and my brothers told me not to tell my mom because they thought they would get in trouble. I didn’t tell and it must have passed because I’m still here. I didn’t even know how lucky I was until I started reading all these comments. ☹️,2021-07-27 17:44:07

Many of them had extra toes.  there was one that weighed 20 pounds and had 6 toes per paw, a club tail, and was born with no right eye. He lived the longest because he kicked the most ass. Any car got out of line he'd punch the shit out them. He purred like a motor and drooled all over.  he loved to be held and would wrap his front paws around your neck in a big hug.  damn good Hunter too. We called him Mr. Eye.  he's been missed going on 30 years now. I remember him like it was yesterday. 😢 but he lived 15  maybe 16 years. 😊 ",2017-09-25 07:15:17

a5djx9,"THIS is the BEST answer, also easiest.

I go more toward low heat but give it time to have a well-heated pan.  Start pan on the stove, get the eggs and butter out, start the coffee, bread in the toaster(but don't push the button yet!)...  Stand around deciding whether you want to start the eggs now or start drinking your coffee first... 

&tc 😀  That's when the pan will be hot enough, ha ha.

Then bumble around getting everything else ready and/or stand there sipping your coffee while you vacantly stare into space.   When the yolks are ALMOST perfect, give them a little private time.  Don't peek!  Put the silverware out, get your plate ready, maybe start buttering your toast.  Done!

a3uyon,"We used to have those in my school’s cafeteria.. stupid, I know.. a place where you’re supposed to be free to talk and chat with friends.. they had it set to a pretty low setting, but it was still somewhat reasonable. There were a couple times when a kid was sitting near it and sneezed and the thing turned to red.. when it would turn to red it meant we had to have 5 minutes of quiet time.. and if the machine detected any noise it would yell at you.. it would say “Please stop talking! There are ___ more minutes left of silent time” or something like that.. so you can imagine if the same kid sneezed or something we’d all be fucked cause it would reset to 5 minutes, then 7 minutes, then 10 etc. 

I can recall, however, one time that we actually deserved it.. it was like the last day before spring break or something.. so kids were just anxious to leave and were being pretty loud. So when the thing went off, kids (who weren’t sitting near it) would cough. It was kinda funny. Then the adult/teacher monitors would go around and shush us all.. saying we couldn’t all cough.. so it eventually stopped.. but then there was me.. oh how I love the prepubescent, yet still old enough to be super awkward stage. I was actually sick... and I coughed. None of the adult monitors were any of my teachers, so they didn’t know I was legitimately sick.. so I coughed and got a lunch detention for the day we got back after the break.

ad98gj,"They were round after The War™ until the early 50's.  I think rectangular ones might have hit in '49.  Color sets were round well into the 60's, in part because of the far larger tube, and also because they couldn't get the edge convergence right.

Metal-glass composite tubes came in both round and rectangular varieties, but that was a pretty short lived fad, as glass manufacturing technology caught up.  Also, the metal-glass seals were fragile, and tended to spring leaks for no good reason.  It's why the number of functional early color TVs can be counted on one or two hands.",2019-01-08 01:03:15
ad98gj,"This. Plus the fact that there's some nasty high voltages lurking inside these tube-amp driven devices ready to strike. Upwards of 700volts DC!! Yeah DC, the one that sucks you in and forces your muscles to contract rendering you immobile whilst still touching it.

>The criteria is only to avoid exploitation of animals so far as is practical. People who eat some and abstain from other animals because of cuteness or any other thing can by definition in no way be called a vegan.

Who set this criteria, and where does it take us? A vegan doesn't eat animals, this we agree on I assmue? But this does not describe motivation. Do all vegans believe it is immoral to eat insects?  What about killing insects and not eating them? All parts of the farming process will kill insects, so is it moral to engage in farming? Eating insects is environmentally friendly, whereas many farming practices are not. You could be hurting more animals eating a plant than a bug in some instances.

Is it moral to eat honey? Are bees being exploited? Does it matter that we have a symbiotic relationship where we both benefit? Does their level of sentience matter? If so, does the cuteness factor impart a bias on what we consider to be sentient animals? If sentience is irrelevant, then eating a living plant might be morally equivalent to eating an insect. 

What about plankton? Is it right to eat phytoplankton but not zooplankton? At a cellular level they are different, but I find it implausible that zooplankton are sentient.

What about Mesodinium chamaeleon? Some are a combination of plant and animal cells! That's not only really cool, but also blurs the moral lines. Can you eat something that is half plant half animal?

...

Okay, so what is my point... It's hard to put things in a nice little pigeonholed box. What are the rules for being a vegan, what are the reasons for being a vegan, and how do you reconcile the edge cases?",2018-04-15 01:28:48

ark78c,">God I just looked through your comments on your profile.

Glad I gained another stalker, will you message me every other day like 3 resident stalker vegans of mine 😍

>Fucking hell, do you need to check your blood pressure?

I don't, but you may have to, since vegans have to get blood work d every other month to make sure they aren't starving themselves anymore than they already are.

>You seem weirdly obsessed with other people's diets.

Says in a thread where every other comment is vegan propaganda, which I disproved in my other comments.

>Maybe all that meat is making you angry.

Meat eaters do have higher testerone and lower estrogen levels compared to vegans, so yeah we are not soyboys and meat might be contributing to that.

>Why do you waste your time bothering what people do or don't eat? 


Why are vegans advocating all over the thread? Did you ask them?

>God 12 year olds are so annoying. 

Considering a 12 year old meat eater could probably break a few bones of an adult vegan(vegans are 3 times more likely to break their bones), I would rather be a meat eater 12 y.o than a vegan. ",2019-02-19 16:33:07

ark78c,">but so do you? Like I said you kill more plants a year than a vegan does 🤨

No, I only kill the murderer herbivores that murder innocent plants.

>Its news to me! And here I was listening to him talking about us getting engaged 😱 but you must know more about me than I do! 

I mean b12 deficiency causes memory loss so you might not even know who you are, so it's a possibility.

>You must be very insecure and immature. You must be like, what? 13? No grown adult talks like this surely 

Vegans do, take a bit of your own medicine.

ark78c,"While I agree that my position may seem nitpicky and annoying, it's for a very real reason.

Mayo has a very specific recipe. Anything else is ""spread."" 🤣

I did enjoy a vegan ""cheesecake"" at a wedding over the summer. It was made from cashews...very tasty, but didn't need to be called ""cheesecake."" Cashew cake would have been just as sufficient to get me to try it.

What you've all been waiting for... I present Bill, and his brother Bowen. I have to hook up my old hard drive to get pictures of Bowen when he was younger to see the movement of his markings aswell. 

Bill is a Staffordshire Terrier/Bullmastiff cross, and Bowen is a Great Dane/Rhodesian Ridgeback cross, and they are the best good boys out there (just like every other doggo on the planet 🤣).

11kg3gi,"That’s not just a $5 bill, it’s a Silver Certificate!

It’s probably not stolen. It was probably an older person who had saved it all this time, but because of the way things are these days had to spend it. 

Many years ago I worked as a bank teller. One of the other tellers was a young girl just out of high school. An elderly lady came in and had coins she needed deposited into her account. She pulled out a draw string bag & the young teller took it to the back to run through our coin machine.

In a very short time she came up & got me. When we got to the back she told me she didn’t think it was real money. I walked back to the coin machine & looked.

It was OLD money, VERY old money! 1800 Silver dollars, half dollars. All of the money was solid silver, no copper centers. Rolls of Liberty dimes & Buffalo head nickels. All together over $200 in coins. 

We did not put it in the Coin machine. In fact I went back to the front to talk to the elderly lady. I asked her if she knew the bag was full of old money, and she said Yes. I then asked if she was sure she wanted it deposited in her checking account. She said Yes. I then leaned close to her and asked if she had Children or Family members that would buy the coins from her so it would stay in the family? She told me No, it all needed to go in the bank.

Me and the young teller hand counted & rolled her coins and made the Deposit slip for the woman to sign. I have collected old coins & bills, like Silver Certificates since I was a kid. I told the young teller I wanted to buy some of the Silver Dollars, I wished I could buy everything but couldn’t afford to. I asked if she wanted to buy any before I sent out an email to everyone in the bank to say they were available at my window. She wasn’t interested…of course she thought it was fake money! Lol

Within minutes of sending out the email everything was gone. People that came over late or didn’t call to save something, missed out. 
We got old coins regularly in rolls, but just one here & there. NEVER anything like this. I felt sorry for this little lady having to cash them in…🙁",2023-03-07 07:40:48

He paid me in just about two thousand dollars worth of two dollar bills. I kid not. I'm still very dumb founded to this day. I asked my friend what in the world had just happened and he shrugged his shoulders, chuckled and said he had no idea either. What was even stranger for me was making the deposit at my bank lol So, not that 2 dollar bills are super rare, but I was one of those people coming in with some really weird shit that day.

11kg3gi,"To reconcile both yours and the person you responded to, sometimes I've encountered kids who found bills hidden in a book and thought those bills were just lost money not realizing their grandparents hid them. 

Its rare and usually stolen if however you come across tender that says something about paying the bearer upon demand the amount of gold the bill represented. Becuase of FDR taking all gold and placed as part if the reserve, these bills were also removed from circulation and destroyed. Likewise because of the text it was considered not honored as regular text and this highly collectible nowadays.

These would be the only types of billa that could be stole or removed from a collector without their permission. The $5   OP showed is nice but isnt collectible more so that the bill detector has ruined a bit of its value being done also 3 times to it. It wouldve been $10-12 to a collector but now down to $7. 

Also, who needs to hit a bit in 3 different areas 🧐 its like if it was counterfit, they wouldnt tape good paper wirh bad paper or whatever, just need to do it once.",2023-03-07 06:25:44

American Orange Fanta is a carbonated orange-flavored soda sweetened with HFCS, whereas UK Fanta is more of an OJ themed soda (complete with some small amount of juice) and is mostly sweetened with alternative sweeteners due to either culture preference or sugar levy. The taste between the two could not be any further apart as far as orangeness goes. Both have their appeal, but the US version is definitely more ""candy-like"".

I miss US Fanta (and grape too, because grape flavored things are not really a thing here. Thanks blackcurrant 🤢) but the UK Fanta has its own appeal though.",2022-03-21 13:09:10

Rewashed all the dishes in the cupboards because ew litter paws...kinda like the time I found out he was licking the sticks of butter on the counter and I realized I’d probably been spreading a lot of cat spit on my toast...made me wonder how many times he’d been on the clean dishes I was using 😖",2019-03-04 08:19:06

Blissful even…So totally worth the 3 days or misery of locking myself in a room with patches and gum, cried my tears of loss, went minute by minute ( drugged myself to sleep a lot), and then…..  VOILA!  I came out of my self-induced locked cell, tobacco free, feelin’ good, no more stinky clothes or breath, no more battling weather bc I had to smoke outside…..I could just……. Be.

It was hard, yes….. but the rewards, I learned, far outweighed the loss of my perceived best friend.  My wallet thanked me as well…. I got an immediate cost-of-living raise to the tune of $3750 a year ( at the time in 2002).

v8cguf,"Yeah i worked there Aug-Jan in 2009/10 and fall used to be such a good time to go because outside of the Halloween Party and food and wine (which were also isolated to one park) attendance was fairly low. That led to me taking annual trips in Off Season. Last time I went in October of 2019 it was just too busy to be fun for what I was paying. 


Like the trip is basically over $1000 for a week for one adult depending (and this was BEFORE you had to pay for fast pass etc) and it just isn’t worth going on like 4 rides and eating mediocre food. 


I get they’re a greedy company who wants money but if I mgoing to spending that much money per visit I’d much rather have less people there 👀


I’ll be really curious how crowds are once all the “first trip post Covid/rescheduled because of Covid” trips are.

9y6kap," A few years back I had something like this grow on my face, just above my right cheekbone. To observe with the naked eye it looked like a tiny pin head dot, but the doctor looked through a very powerful magnifying glass and informed me it was a little tree of sorts. He had never seen the like of this before and asked me to return in a week or two. 
 A few weeks later I returned and again he got the magnifying glass and was able to inform me that several little trees had grown and there was also a little pool of water! The doctor was flabbergasted, I was speechless. Again he asked that I return. 
 On my next visit, two or three weeks later, he was able to tell from looking through the magnifying glass that the trees were in bloom, the pool of water was a pond and was now home to a family of little ducks and there appeared to be what he thought was a park bench situated next to the pond and just below what he described as “an umbrella shaped tree, covered in beautiful pink blossoms “
 The doctor stared at me as he scratched his head in bewilderment. “I’m sending you to a specialist “, he muttered. Admitting defeat. 
 The meeting with the specialist was arranged and off I went to see him. It had been eight months since I had first went to my doctor. The little dot had got a bit bigger by now, roughly the size of a little rain drop. To the naked eye it looked like nothing other than an ink mark on my face. 
 The specialist knew right away what it was.. he smiled at me, a reassuring smile “Nothing to worry about” he said. 
“But what is it doctor, what is this thing on my face” I asked. I couldn’t believe it when he told me, I should have known...

“It’s a beauty spot!”😉

zszti0,"Wtffffff. Personally.... I would have.               
1️⃣  Called a buddy to get some salvage titles at a local wreck yard ASAP. Luckily he works nights!  
2️⃣  Taken a pic of each car at lot & mileage. (Hoodie/face mask - walked from few blocks away)                                                                        
3️⃣  Then went to the nearest craphole of a city and made a FORTUNE. Those cars are usually new to MAYBE 3  yrs old !

Sold each one for 6 - 8 K cash depending on year/mileage/model. THATS A LOT OF KEYS.

They can pick cars up themselves before rental place opens by hitting the button on the key FOB to find their car😂

1286vtx,"A female molded mouth? A mouth is a mouth 😉.

Edit: Jesus Christ, a HUMAN mouth is a HUMAN mouth. Fuck.

EDIT2: FUCKING LORD. an ADULT HUMAN mouth is an ADULT HUMAN mouth. And before you say anything the owner of that mouth also needs to be conscious, and consent to oral sex without having their mind or perception altered in some way, or being coerced. And by owner I mean the person it is attached to, who is also the person who was born with it, lest we get any fucked up slavery or guro shit. Lord you try to be playfully bisexual ONE TIME.

Edit3: GOD FUCKING DAMNIT. I don't know how anyone would get the idea from the above that this is allowed, but NO SEVERED HEADS, even if they can blink out some signal for consent for a few seconds after they've been decapitated and before experiencing complete brain death. There is no way that an actively dying brain can be trusted to give informed consent or to control its eyes reliably. And for that matter NO DEAD PEOPLE. I would have thought that stipulating the person must be conscious would indicate that they also need to be alive. Sure I've seen ghosts in my life but I also have a fragile sack of fat and chemicals controlling my consciousness(as do we all), and I probably hallucinated it. Show me conclusive proof of ghosts and I might change my mind.",2023-04-01 02:29:12

Few years later I needed a root canal and the dentist messed that up and to this day I have not returned to any dentist to have my mouth cleaned or any work done.

eaabgh,"Teacher here, and I posted my experience as a TIFU from a year ago. Enjoy. 😂


I am a high school science teacher, and this year we are using a brand new curriculum to teach our freshman Biology classes. 

At the start of the year, I was upfront and honest with my students about the new curriculum, and how we might have a couple days where things go haywire running new labs. Today was the first. 

During lab today, the classroom became loud as the lab requires students to use forks to pick rice out of a container. (Part two lets them see how a spoon is much more advantageous, and thus, naturally selected for.) The students have 30 seconds to pick rice out and put it into a cup. 

Three rounds into the lab, it is clearly going fine, but not how I intended and there is a lot of mess. During one 30 second trial, I sat down at my desk and mumbled, “this is fucking chaos.”

At that time, I remembered my hearing impaired student. They have a cochlear implant, and I wear an FM transmitter around my neck so they can hear me. Crap...

I then said quietly, but loud enough for the transmitter to pick it up, “Student, did you hear what I said?”

Slowly, with their back turned to me, I see the left hand raise up in the air, and simply receive a 👍 from the student. 

So, today is the first time in nearly 10 years I dropped and F bomb in class, and I wanted to share with you as well. 

tl:dr - The fm transmitter my hearing impaired student uses heard me curse about how bad a lab was going.",2019-12-14 01:33:37
eaabgh,"Teacher here, I have to same one! Feels cool right? Like your on stage. I always forget to turn mine to mute when not talking and we came up with a symbol for the student to tell me to mute it: he puts his hand up in the heavy  metal symbol 🤘",2019-12-14 01:17:51
eaabgh,Yay! This is an FM system and super awesome way to support kids with hearing loss 👍,2019-12-14 02:12:53
eaabgh,"Product link please, thanks in advance. 👊🏽",2019-12-14 03:02:05
eaabgh,Definitely forget to turn it off when you pee. My student never looked at me the same and anytime I left the room he reminded me to mute myself. 🤗🤗,2019-12-14 04:01:49
eaabgh," I'm on the severe-profound end of the spectrum, generally hearing aids are a panacea. I'm still deaf and use BSL. I will never forget the day I tried my Phonak radio aid and streamer for the first time. My pals and the conference mic (I think that's what you have) actually went into a different room bantering away and I heard it all, the clarity hit me like a tonne of bricks  how I could follow a conversation with folk not even in the same room. Couldn't help but greet. We all had a greet actually! Theres no listening energy or lip reading required just easy, laid back sound. 

This being said please still be deaf aware it still doesn't pick up everything but what it does pick up is smashing 👍",2019-12-14 04:06:38
eaabgh,I used that when teaching one of my classes! Super helpful 😊,2019-12-14 05:44:18
eaabgh,"Used the same one with a former student of mine. On the first few days we had it, it was great to see him respond to his name which we hadn’t seen him do much when he just had the hearing aids. After a few days the selective hearing came back and he started ignoring us again 🙃",2019-12-14 05:46:16
eaabgh,"https://youtu.be/yuXGpUR7fXA OP you watch this, just so you know when to remember to turn the thing off 😂",2019-12-14 07:41:05
eaabgh,"I’ve had to wear one of these. Just make sure it’s turned off when you leave the classroom. They can eavesdrop on conversations like the teachers lounge, 🤣",2019-12-14 07:47:33
eaabgh,"Ah , I went through school with hearing aids (obviously still have them now). And this tech has come a long way. Mine used to be two wireless boxes and mine was bright yellow, bucked around my waist and wired to me hearing aids 😂

Phonak roger also have a pen which you can use in a conference and just looks like a pen really. 

There is also a bunch of progress now with MFI hearing aids (made for iPhone) which have direct Bluetooth connection. They can sync with IFTTT and announce push notifications (like someone ringing a Ringing doorbell). 

I can’t wait for the time that having there high fidelity multifunctional digital hearing aids actually becomes convenient - because they have good microphones built in there no reason you want take calls on them, use Alexa etc.",2019-12-14 12:30:01
eaabgh,"Seriously, what a jerk. Glad she got reported. It literally costs nothing and is of no inconvenience of her to help them out a little. I can’t even fathom why her reasoning behind not obliging was. 🙄",2019-12-14 01:21:18
eaabgh,"As I just posted in my own comment, [you can read about my experience with this exact issue here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9jqacl/tifu_by_letting_a_predominantly_deaf_student_hear/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

When I leave then inside on my windowsill, if I forget to water them a few times, between that and the lack of food all the heads die off and only tiny ones grow back https://i.imgur.com/ytgjV9E.jpg

I spent the afternoon in a local park with my iPad teaching myself how to make instrumentals (using bars properly to change notes was something I didn't know about so that's what I practiced today).

I made something a bit cyberpunk and funky. It's not good by any means but like I said it's practice. :)

Your video post of the coop in transit made me laugh so hard out loud. I had to watch it on loop several times to get the giggles out. 

I also shed a heart tear on the post you shared about your loss. I feel you on that and appreciate  that you shared such a vulnerable thing that so many people experience. Fist pumps, respect, and a hug from Internet stranger (in return for your amazing Instagrams).

Years ago my wife had a co-worker and friend born without a hand and most of her forearm. It looked like an amputation just below the elbow, but it was congenital.  She could bend her arm and hold things, and was pretty dexterous with it. At just about every party or gathering I saw her at (and there were maybe a 100 or so) she always found at least one occasion to goof around or pull a clever gag - usually with somebody who didn’t know her or hadn’t met her before.  She was (and still  is, I’m sure) so cool and comfortable and un-self conscious. She had the ability to put folks instantly at ease.  I always admired her.

I noticed you dropped 3 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

I've been surprised how many people try to give the reusable cloth bag and/or ribbons back.  I'm like, ""Um, no, that's for you, too.  Unless you don't want it.""  And then they are like ""Wow, yes I want it, thanks!""  Just realized maybe I should give people reusable cloth bags and ribbon wrapped in throwaway paper wrapping-paper.  😂

One year I made a bunch of date-balls to bring to a few different holiday visits.  I ended up putting them all in whatever big jars I had on hand and I had too many jars anyway.  My Mom brought the jar back and I said, ""I'm trying to GET RID OF the extra jars!""  She said, ""Okay.  But we really liked the dateballs -- can you make another batch and THEN I won't bring the jar back?""  ☺",2021-12-27 00:58:28

gu2dd3,"There's a few different ways. For me, I just asked my friend group if they wanted to try it. It was a bit of an investment–I went the expensive route, and bought the starter set, a player's handbook, dungeon master's guide, monster manual, game mat, and dice for the two players who didn't have any.

Most of that isn't strictly necessary–the game mat can just be a table, you can get apps for dice rolling, and you can get the books through 🏴‍☠️ other 🏴‍☠️ means. I would *never* condone piracy, but if all you're doing is typing ""5e d&d player's handbook"" into Google and clicking the third or fourth link, that's hardly a crime.

Another option is finding out if your city has a D&D Facebook page. There's always people in my town's D&D page that want to start a campaign. Right now might not be the best time for that, though...

I would suggest listening to or watching people play D&D before you spend much money, just to get a good idea of how the game is played. The Adventure Zone is a great podcast, partially because pretty much all those guys were new to the game too. The Critical Role Twitch/Youtube channel is a lot better about following the actual *rules* of the game, though.",2020-06-01 00:51:21

It's clearly not weak, because look at how upset ya are. I don't have to be magical to know when a troll is ass hurt.

Also, just for you know, this IS a legit post you foil hate wearing troll. I know this person in real life, he found this at a place he was working at earlier today.

edyhhj,"I give my cats a little cheese, salami, eggs, ham, bread, almost whatever.
And my cats are really funny because they like a lot of different things, some quite strange. Let me elaborate.


One of my cats Sneaker, he's crazy about chips, milk, meat of course of any kind, and likes oats and oats with yoghurt. My other cat Blonda eats mashed potatoes, chips, bread and cheese, but she also LOVES raw onion, raw potatoes, raw corn, she loves pufulets and a ton of stuff!


She also eats root vegetables and cucumber and water melon. Super cute and funny. And then she had issues figuring out how to eat a raw sardine, only one of my cats who struggled haha 😹


They eat a lot of things. Even some of them like raw hemp powder, seed mixes and various other things. Last night I caught them eating this type of dry breadsticks (covrig but dry) that they all enjoyed.

I even had a cat when I was younger that wanted a little coffee every morning. He'd come and sit by the table and look at you for coffee and cheese. And if you ignored him he'd gently place his paw on your hand. Sergei was his name.",2019-12-22 07:22:15
edyhhj,"Same.  My cats go apeshit when they see me getting milk for myself, so I'll give them each an ounce or so to lap up.

7u9fhc,"Nature: FUCK YOU!!!

Cool fact:  The middle finger, Now commonly referred to as meaning ""fuck you""    originally meant ""up yours""  with the fist being an ass shape and the finger a penis and was commonly accompanied by the phrase ""fuck you"" to shorten the phrase ""fuck you up your ass"".  

And long story short... as with most things kids assumed that it meant ""fuck you"" and they soon became adults and that is soon what it became to mean.

Edit:

Bonus fact: fucking somebody up there ass used to be considered vulgar but then girls (and guys) started to like it. 😁 ",2018-01-31 15:00:33

11pstq8,"So, I have to pay for the ability to get $300? When did this start? Welp, I have some research on this one to do. 😁",2023-03-13 07:13:31
11pstq8,"I worked at CiCi’s for 4 years starting the day I turned 14. We had multiple goofball managers but there was one in particular named Steve that rubbed everyone the wrong way. 

One day a busboy (David) that worked with me told me that he was going to dump out one of the bottles of cleaner and fill it with bleach. We made the cleaner by hand at the time and if memory serves me correct, it was roughly 80% water. David was then going to spray Steve with the bleach next time he came back into the kitchen. A few minutes pass and Steve marches into the kitchen and tells David that he was being too slow at cleaning the tables and threw a few cheap shots at David as always. David turns around and gives Steve approximately 10 good sprays directly in his black jeans he was wearing. Steve actually gave us a rare laugh and didn’t think much of it believing that the bottle was filled with the water based cleaner as always. Steve then returned to the front of the store to continue about his day. 

Roughly a half an hour later, I see Steve’s foot come through the swinging metal kitchen door as he nearly kicks it off of the hinges. I had never seen someone’s face so angry and red. I quickly looked down and saw that his black jeans were now completely covered with reddish/orange bleach spots. Without skipping a beat, Steve yelled at the top of his lungs “GODDAMMIT DAVID, THESE WERE A $35 PAIR OF DOCKERS!!!!!”

It was one of the funniest lines that I had ever heard come out of someone’s mouth in my 15 years of living even though Steve was beyond furious and was not being comical. He was more than serious. I am 40 years old now and I still laugh out loud at this from time to time.

Edit: My brother worked at CiCi’s before I did and Steve was his manager also. Steve made one of the workers so mad that the guy dumped an entire bucket of water on him while he was pooping at work. Steve apparently had on a white dress shirt that day with nothing underneath. The restroom was at the very back of the store so my brother said Steve had to walk past an entire full restaurant soaking wet with his nipples showing through his white dress shirt 😂",2023-03-13 12:51:05

10c2wte,"Air conditioners contain refrigerants that are an environmental hazard and harm the ozone layer. The reason why the surplus shop has them is because the prior owner or manufacturer doesn’t want to pay to dispose of the hazardous material properly (I would hazard a guess the disposal fee is more than $5). 

This store knows that whomever is buying the AC units wants scrap metal or MAYBE replacement electronic parts. In short, the store is serving as a middle man in a transaction it knows will result in dumping of hazardous materials.  This seems super fucked up to me and maybe illegal 🤷‍♂️

Disclaimer:  I’m not an environmental lawyer, I have very little knowledge of HVAC units (to the point that I don’t even know if new ones still use ozone depleting refrigerant), and I’m not in the haz-mat disposal business.  But this raises some red flags for me.",2023-01-15 04:49:21

10c2wte,"yeah but this is a completely out-of-touch statement. Poor people, and every study ever, all already have known forever that being poor is more expensive. Of COURSE it’s cheaper to buy a new car that isn’t going to be in the shop 4 times a year. But poor people can’t get loans or afford a new car. Poor folk (and btw, right now over half Americans live paycheck to paycheck and that qualifies) aren’t able to maintain or add to a savings and they tend to get turned down for loans and don’t have the same social safety nets (people to go to to borrow money or help dig them out), so it is not for lack of knowing that “buy once cry once” is the more intelligent practice and that spending a grand today might save you 3 grand over a couple years. It’s that it is completely impossible to even always put food on the table sometimes or gas in the car, you sure as shit don’t have $200 for a used washer and you absolutely don’t have a grand for a higher-end one. It is a complete lack of resources. An impossibility. There is zero money to put towards a better or newer product lol. Not to mention for people who can’t put food on their families plates reliably, it would be irresponsible to buy a quality ANYTHING. You’re getting by off stuff that’s half broke all the time lol. 

Just sayin, it’s kinda dumb advice for people to say “just buy new” lol like that’s something we all wouldn’t prefer to working ourselves to death to get some piece of shit fixed until we die. It’s like when people tell people “just go to college to make more $” - great advice! Maybe. But you can’t go to college if you’re having to work 2-3 jobs and are a caregiver. 

Buying a house is way cheaper than throwing more than a mortgage worth of cash down the drain and dying without a dime of equity. Getting proactive/preventative healthcare is way cheaper than developing serious complications from untreated disease. 

I could go on forever. But you should know, people who say “Akshually it’s less expensive over x timeline to spend more money now” don’t realize how ignorant they sound of the real world, nor the bubble of privilege they live in. Not to mention the condescending smarmy arrogance of imagining these very simple concepts have not occurred to people with cars that won’t run and washers that keep breaking down. You can safely assume it’s occurred to them it would be better to have a more quality product LOL. 🤡",2023-01-15 15:42:32

I take the letters off (de-badge) all my cars; I just think it looks cleaner 🤷🏻‍♂️

Some WD-40 and a rag will get the rest of the gunk off no problem. For the rest of them, grab some dental floss and run it back and forth—in a sawing motion—until they come off. Don’t pull or bend back, or it might damage the finish.

du1hdf,"You said light which I conceded, then you said traffic which lead me to believe you were talking about being on the freeway, driving, etc. Where I'm at we have to get on a major highway for getting most places so when I think 'stuck in traffic' I think someone got in a accident (usually phone related) and it's backing up for miles. I live in a city though. TBH a lot of it just takes judgement. I'll be honest that I use my phone at lights sometimes but I'm sure to not do anything that takes my attention away from what's going on form more than 5 seconds. I also generally know how longs the lights are at that intersection so I'll stay off it if I know the light's about the change.

cu4993,When I was growing up in NZ our family would take me blueberry picking at a farm. You would bring your tray up to be weighed and collect an envelope with your earnings from a house once a week. Anyway since I was so little I could get under the bushes and find the really big juicy blueberries. I would mash them between leaves and make blueberry stick skewers. Now as an adult I find them to be costly and often quite small. I must have eaten my lifetime quota over those happy times 😀,2019-08-23 05:33:55

There are several uniform pieces you can mix and match as you like. The closest thing to a winter garment would be the puffer jacket insert that can be added to the all weather jacket shell. Women can also choose wether to wear dress pants, a skirt or a dress. 
Everyone can also choose between wearing a short/ long sleeve dress shirt and a blue t shirt that you can optionally layer with a knitted jacket, blazer or a knitted cardigan(women only). There are three different outer coats; the aforementioned shelljacket, a bomber style jacket and a trenchoat(women only). The poncho is a favourite of many as it is super comfy and gets a lot of compliments. Also wearing a cape i just cool in general. I love the uniform and how versatile it is, and how everyone can choose which pieces they want to wear at any given time.",2023-03-28 17:46:07

As another aside; the thinner pencils are ideal for doing zipped dotted lines (idk if that’s an actual term but when you can bounce the pencil along and get a dotted line) but you could only do it once... cruel irony of the world we live in 😔",2021-03-12 17:54:46

byq61o,"A good cop won't arrest a little kid but they will ask you to stop selling.

I work at Wrigley Field and there are independent vendors outside the stadium.  They all have to pay the fees for the license to sell drinks.  Last year a little girl set up shop next to them to sell lemonade and was undercutting them like crazy!! I mean fresh lemonade for $1 from a cute little girl or a bottle of Coke for $3 from a grizzled old man? 😂😂😂

She was gone the next homestand.  When I asked a vendor where she went, he said they demanded the cops check for her license.  Of course she didn't have one so they asked her to stop selling and she had to comply.   Honestly I don't even blame the vendors.

About a month ago though I saw her again.  This time the lemonade was free but she was asking for $1 'donations'.  Little girl is sly.....",2019-06-10 11:45:28

b4qdsf,"Only the weak, fragile millenial generation has this problem. Back in my day (high school in the late 1960s), all the men had deep voices, even the nerds and geekos and dweebs. We still beat them up, but that didn't matter. Men back then were real men. There's no testosterone these days because the millenials have been brainwashed by the media to be soft. I long for the days when men were men and women were women.

**COMMENT ALTERATION #☝️:** Whooooooa Bundry! I get downloads just for reminiscing? I'll have you know that at my age I can still beat up plenty of geekos. Don't let yourself think that this blog will protect you out in the real world!

**COMMENT ALTERATION #✌️:** Apparently, people have no idea who I am, otherwise they wouldn't be downloading me like this! Do you have any idea that you're downloading the one and only Sal Bundry, the ""Touchdown Brundy,"" the one person in the entire WORLD that, in 1966, scored 5 touchdowns in 1 game while playing for the Folk High School Pantwearers! I could throw a football over a mountain, and sprint the entire distance of a football field in 10 seconds flat!

This is a post about overmemeing so you're memeing more about overmemeing by overmemeing here in response to a meme that's memeing about overmemeing in response to your overmemeing post! Incredible! Creative! Masterful! Original! Innovative!

These karma grabs are just atrocious. Have you no shame? Is this how you figured your life: typing away on this blog, hoping to get some internet points that have literally no value whatsoever?

Well, I hope you're happy. But guess what? I'm not.

That's why I'm giving you this download. And I hope that this download teaches you a lesson. A lesson to be a better, more original thinker and poster. Think of my download as a parental punishment. It's done out of love, not hate.

Do better, son.
