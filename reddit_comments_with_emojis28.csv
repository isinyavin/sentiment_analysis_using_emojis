l7a4a8,"That's the thing, though. If I had the balls (and funds) to drop 50k on a cheap stock that only I find undervalued, I would have definitely cashed at least 75% out when it quadrupled after a year (honestly probably even sooner) and keep 25% in stocks and do the same every time it doubled or so. To hold onto that once it gets past 500k, then 1m, then 5m, then 10m, then 15m, then 30m, then 50m *and still hold when it drops  $20,000,000*, is absolute fucking insanity. Maybe I would ride out the last wave when I had cashed out maybe 500k, but not any sooner.

Sure, I would've only come out of that same play with a mil in the best possible scenario(can't be arsed to do the math right now), but just the balls on the lad. If he wasn't already a multimillionaire beforehand, he must've lost a couple of years due to the stress. 

That being said I did buy $1000 on Friday and am up 400% so hold 💎🙌💎🙌💎😩

Edit: apparently he cashed out 13 mil. Jesus. I still wouldn't have made it to that if I had bought 50k of GME a year ago.",2021-01-29 01:07:27

Also, the consoles released during a pandemic. Which he wouldn't have known in 2019, but definitely in 2020. Besides, console releases are pretty much priced in for stocks at this point, so investing in 2019 so you could jump the gun on other investors doing the same in 2020 is a smart move, but not a 100.000% profit move.

However, it does make sense from a general business perspective to run lines that exceed current demands. It is extremely expensive to run fiber lines and the last thing you want to do is have to dig up the same area and run lines a year later. 

I've had many professors who have worked in the field and this comes up often when talking about how businesses plan for expansion and continued growth. So is artificially increasing the prices the primary reason for this? 🤷‍♀️ But it's likely a side effect of it.

frbnqq,"You missing my point. Video can cause lost revenues. It’s not always a net gain. Maybe for Comcast, but not for many of their partner MSOs. 

In fact un-bundling internet causes a higher rate for that service and even MORE profit. Often, for us, this covers the lost video.... we make very little or no money on video. Customer loses the discount and we’re OK making a higher profit on internet. Internet has been subsidizing video for a while, and the thought was video made a customer more likely to stay. It doesn’t. 

So analysts are happy with lost cord cutters, and happier if mobile is focus instead. Mobile is more revenue than video. 

Video is expensive to gain and maintain customers. You spend a lot of money getting a video customer, getting them installed, subsidizing boxes, paying license fees, offering promos. 

You lose money at first and then they may switch away for another promo or cut cord anyways. Better to pick up a mobile, internet, and OTT cord-cutter/cord-never. 

You can argue with me all you want, I don’t care what your opinion is. I was shocked by this answer too, and it seems at first like what you are saying is intuitively true. Industry analysts think otherwise though, and no longer care for cord-cutting. It’s not an area they care about. 

They want Internet + Mobile. It’s not my argument and I really have no stake in it. 

But yes, get people to cut the cord. We still win and I still have a job. ✌🏻🖖🏻

It was only “stopped” because they were evacuated in time, and not before a woman was shot dead for getting close.

And at its core, the problem is what you’re displaying in your comment: this pathological need to ignore problems right in front of you because you desperately need to think you’re superior to other countries, and it always has to come back to how you’re amazing and perfect because hey, at we handled a coup better than a failed African state and that makes me soooo proud!

At that time the only thing they had left was the big bags of AP so I went with it. We went to do our monthly shopping on Tuesday since we are limiting our trips out to once a month now while all this is going on and they had a few bags of flour at our local store that were just getting stocked. I looked for self rising but they didn’t have it so I left what was there for someone else and I’ll just make due with what I have. I hope you find some flour soon ❤️,2020-04-09 13:37:36
fxhd5n,"Not a Corona story, but summer before my Junior year of college my university finally finished construction on a massive new student center, which was honestly amazing. What was utterly asinine was the plaza in front of it. You see, the main entrance to the SC directly faced a giant elegant staircase coming off the back of the nursing building, about 100 feet away. Logic would dictate you have a cement plaza connecting these two things directly in a straight line, right? Wrong. What you instead do is have 1) a semicircular plaza made of concrete about 75 feet in diameter with the round edge attached to the SC, then 2) have a 3 times as large grassy area separating the nursing building and plaza with a sidewalk perimeter. 

TL;DR, rather than have a short straight path, you’d have to walk 5 times the distance and at least a flight of stairs to go from the nursing building to the SC🤦Needless to say, students just walked across the grass.

Now, my university took great pride in its lawns. Like, Great Pride. The only patches students were allowed to walk on (for fear of actual fines) were the front lawns because that was picturesque, and a small empty lot at the back of the campus. However, despite the fines, students continued to ignore these rules when dealing with the SC/nursing building problem to the point that the grass became so worn down you could (and still can) see it from google maps.

Fast forward to my senior year, and me getting back from winter break. Because the SC also held our cafeteria, I of course walked out the main entrance after dinner, and lo and behold: the jankiest, cheapest, dollar-store-plastic, 6 feet of faux picket fence standing right at the edge of the concrete plaza directly in the path of the fence. They legitimately thought this was a solution to the problem. Really.

Thankfully, my school really wasn’t a party school. Most of the idiots got filtered out by the end of freshman year, leaving only students who actually wanted to be there, so it wasn’t as simple as one day waking up to finding the fence destroyed. No, people just. Went around it. Like, it was literally just slightly changing the direction of your walk. That was all it took to not worry about the fence. 

Needless to say it was removed within two weeks, though the school still hasn’t wisened up enough to build a dang sidewalk.",2020-04-09 03:58:45

Fast forward an hour later, I drove us to his moms house to pick her up. I was super familiar with the road, also took multiple driving courses so I like to think I knew what I was doing. I wanted to teach him a lesson. For about 5 minutes, I upped my speed till I was going 80mph on a 40. He nervously goes and says ""Aren't....aren't you going a little fast...?"" Deadass looked at him and said, ""what are you, my dad?""

You’ve got over 70% of Americans for legalizing cannabis at the federal level, but because McConnell doesn’t want to, it won’t happen. And many of those bills he won’t bring to the floor are bipartisan and would benefit all Americans. But he won’t bring those for a vote, either. He’s holding the country hostage and needs to be voted out (which I hope to happily do this November). 

And kudos on spelling my name right. I have family members that still misspell it. 😂

And, of course, a second impeachment would be totally redundant because he’s already impeached (which is the joke, I assume). It’s just a lot of people do think it’s the house not doing their job.",2020-02-11 18:06:32

Lmao I really *really* hope you don't actually work in marketing. Because if you do then you absolutely suck at your job. Thinking reddit is bad for marketing because some people ""sniff out"" obvious ads is ridiculous. You know who else hates ads? Literally fucking everyone on every platform. Everyone who ever watched cable and had to sit through ads hates them. Every single person on every single streaming service absolutely HATES ads. Reddit is no different. Yet ads still work. Marketing still works. And marketing on reddit ABSOLUTELY works.

Like I said, I really hope you don't actually work in marketing. Because you sound like a teenager who has no clue how advertising works. And thinks that because people complain about ads it means they don't work. And thats so far from being true that it's honestly hilarious 😂 you're probably a kid who legitimately thinks ""Marketing and ads don't work on me"" lmao",2023-06-10 04:54:14

af7gwv,"What might help your wife understanding the need to vaccinate is the drop in herd immunity and very fatal risk to weaker populations and patients. 

We're literally having one of the largest measles outbreak in New York right now. It's so contagious that if you're in the room, there's over a 90% chance you'll get contaminated.

Vaccines help your child grow antibodies and their own immunity, BUT they also as a barrier to those whom CAN'T build up their own immunity (aka Immunocomprimised). Younger children and infants, pregnant women, Elderly, HIV/Aids patients, even people just sick or with a chronic condition are at risk because their bodies aren't strong enough to respond adequately to a deadly bacteria like measles, mumps, polio... Etc. Unfortunately, families not vaccinating is leading to the resurgence of the most deadly disease we've ever known.

I hope this helps a bit, at least might provide an alternative perspective in how not vaccinating affects a lot more than just your child.

WTH!

Now with a regular card, it just spits out a ticket and says you are approved.  You don't get a chance to decide whether or not you like the interest.

Makes me wonder, will I still get credit for an approved card, or an attempt -  even though the customer got all the way to the end, and then cancelled?

Here, have some of these  

###  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀",2021-01-24 18:01:02
l41t64,"GME has been shorted by multiple investment firms. Basically this means that they sold shares of the company, without actually owning those shares in the first place. They're essentially borrowing shares, selling them at the current price that they believe is overvalued and betting that the price will go down by some certain date at which point they would buy them back (at what they hope to be the lower cost) and make a profit. When you do this though there's such a thing as interest that accrues on those shares so if you lose your bet that the stock price would go down, the longer you keep your position open the longer you have to pay this interest.

What happens if you lose your bet that the stock price goes down though and it's actually going up?  Well you'd essentially have to buy back the shares you shorted to prevent losing even more money. This in turn actually raises the share price which also could mean there are then more people who are willing to bet that the price will decrease. This is what's known as a short squeeze and can theoretically occur ad infinitum.

Because of Gamestop's business model it's been heavily shorted on wall street. In fact from what I understand it's the most heavily shorted stock in history. This effectively spells $$$ for people that bought hundreds or thousands of shares back when it was cheaper because shorts buying back their shares is driving the stock price up.

In fact it's not just shares but calls too. A call is basically you betting that the stock price will increase by a certain date and reserving the right to buy it at whatever it's current price is even if the stock price goes up.

So say GME is worth $5 a share currently. For a fee, I can pay some $500 (or whatever the cost of the call is ), bet that the price will go up by say 2/20, and at any time between now and 2/20 i can buy GME shares for $5 a share, EVEN if it's currently at $60 a share.

&#x200B;

But how and why is this happening to Gamestop? Like I mentioned most people on wall street  thought Gamestop would die as a company. For one reason or another back when GME stock was a lot cheaper it became a meme stock on WSB with a few members genuinely believing in its potential

But relatively recently they have brought on Ryan Cohen to their board of directors. Basically this guy is very promising for Gamestop as people think he will be able to transition the company to a heavy e-commerce player as opposed to the predominantly brick & mortar company it's been in the past. He turned the petfood e-commerce company Chewy into a $4 billion company, so God only knows what he can do in the gaming industry .WSB then realizes that this no meme stock at all this could actually legit be a stock worth owning long term.

So now you have some people that have bought in, and are still buying in for the short squeeze and some people buying in because they're betting on whatever Ryan Cohen's vision for the company is and/or both reasons. The stock price for Gamestop has soared so some people that got in early are potentially making millions and even more when this continues since not all of the shorts have covered their positions yet.

There's more to it than this, but I think this covers most of the important parts of how and why this is going on.

**TL;DR:**

* Big money people think Gamestop will die; they bet share price will fall and so borrow shares, sell them now to buy back at a lower price later to make a profit.
* Investors won't let GME die
* GME becomes meme stock on WSB
* Gamestop brings on Ryan Cohen and people realize this may be no meme stock at all but damn legit.
* More people buy GME
* People that bet share price will fall are wrong, they keep being wrong but the shares they borrowed have interest so they have to buy back eventually to prevent losing more money
* GME 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀, \^ cycle repeats, WSB makes $$$",2021-01-24 23:57:46

l41t64,"I’m gonna try and sum this up.

GME has been on decline due to their business model being brick and mortar selling games. New consoles and PC games are really going to stream or download. Which kills their business model.

Lots of institutions saw this as a way to sell the stock short (bet it’s going down). New management who has a success on online retail bought in. The r/wallstreetbets peeps thought this could make the stock go up.

So on the one hand you have institutional investors with billions betting it’ll go down and then these guys thinking it’ll go up. So they started buying stocks, causing those betting it’ll go down to have their short sales called in, which purchases more stocks, causing the stock to go up even more. Wash rinse repeat.

It’s called a short squeeze because you’re squeezing the people who are betting the stock will go down by forcing them to buy the shares at market rate, which then makes the stock go up.

7h3a93,"We do drill in the Arctic and they have been producing oil since the late 70s.  The trans-alaskan pipeline sends about 500k barrels a day through it now. The infrastructure is already in place and the oil relatively cheap compared to fracking in the Bakken Shale... That's typically where they say the price of oil needs to be above $100 a barrel to make drilling new Wells profitable. I used to work up in the Arctic for a pipeline company. I think we're still a couple decades away from being able to use renewable energy for all our needs and that producing it in America is incredibly important for geopolitical reasons, but I also think our environmental standards are higher than nearly anywhere else producing oil. Trust me I was impressed about the care and concern for the environment. Every truck has a diaper so nothing drips from it into the tundra, they build massive Caribou crossings so the animals have access and ways around the pipelines. I'm not saying this is a great thing, but there is a reason the senator from Alaska wanted this for her state. It is a giant wasteland up there and allowing company's to access the area for drilling doesn't mean the environment will be destroyed and it doesn't mean animals will not be able to live there. From the eyes of many Alaskans the federal government took control of a huge part of their state and really have no idea what they are trying to regulate. I voted for the Green Party, the environment is incredibly important to me, but I'm also realistic and know that oil is going to be around for at least another couple decades. The world is better off if we're producing oil. If you want to protest this, it's important to eat local, don't get avocados that traveled halfway around the world. Don't buy stuff that was shipped from China. Ride your bike and carpool. It's our thirst for oil and the comforts of a modern day diet and our appetite for cheap consumer products that drive the global demand for oil. You can't say no more oil and the go ear 🥑 toast that requires half the ingredients to be shipped and trucked to your local grocery store. I'm working on it myself. Eat local, shop for locally produced consumer goods and simply don't buy consumer products you don't need. Don't use plastic water bottles etc...

7sf1zu,"You're in the predicted ballpark.

Back o' the Napkin:

210 mile orbit - 7,518 Starlink satellites  
750 mile orbit - 4,425 Starlink satellites

Speed o' Light (vacuum): 299,792,458 meters per second   
1,609.34 meters per mile  
Time = Distance / Speed

---
One-Way trip To/From Satellite/Base-station = 

210 miles : (337961.4m) / (299,792,458mps) = 0.001127317886s * (1000) = 1.127317886ms  

750 miles: (1207005m) / (299,792,458mps) = 0.00402613530725s * (1000) = 4.02613530725ms

So, 1 to 4 milliseconds latency, one-way (Vs Geosync's 120 milliseconds, one-way)

I hear packet-switched ***routing*** is going to be occurring ***in*** the satellite constellation, satellite-to-satellite. 

So instead of your packets going up to the satellite and then down to a nearby ground-station, where they are put on The Internet™ to wend their way onwards towards their terrestrial destination (via Fiber), they will be routed at the So'L (vacuum) closest to their destination and ***then*** down to a ground-station.

**Old School:**  
120ms from you UP to Geosync satellite,  
120ms DOWN to nearby ground-station,  
xxxms across The Internet™ to destination,  
(xms at porn site)  
xxxms back across The Internet™ to ground-station,  
120ms UP to Geosync satellite,  
120ms DOWN to you,  

*Minimum* Latency = 480ms

**New S'cool:**  
4ms from you UP to Starlink satellite,  
xxms satellite-to-satellite routing,  
4ms DOWN to ground-station near destination,  
xxms short Internet™ hop(s) to destination,  
(xms at porn site)  
xxms short Internet™ hop(s) back to ground-station,  
4ms UP to Starlink satellite,  
xxms satellite-to-satellite routing,  
4ms DOWN to you  

Minimum Latency = Unknown, since we don't know the speed of inter-satellite routing, which will be different if you're going next door or all the way around the planet. But if you're going next door, you may see as little as 4*4= 16ms round-trip.

#In Theory

(and assuming I didn't fuck that all up ;)

Realistically, in the neighborhood of 30ms latency is a more reasonable number I've seen bandied about.",2018-01-23 18:19:29

We shall implement ""said law"" in hopes that said ""metric"" will improve. Sunsets in 10 years. 10 years pass.. Congress gets to talking about it again as sunsetting laws have to be brought up because it's their job. Brings up ""said metric"" to see if any improvement shown.

c3w4nm,"Fuck off with your ignorance. Actually do some research on the guy before you open your mouth to regurgitate all the bullshit you've been being spoonfed. 

The left refuses to even look into his legislature because its too ""racist"". If you read up on his legislature, you'd know that impeachment would be stupid. He has done nothing that qualifies impeachment, and anyone asking for impeachment is literally an idiot. Do you want president pence? Because thats how you get president pence.

So i've got a few comments that i've saved regarding Trump. I'd like to see someone tell me what he's done that calls for impeachment. I'll post about both what i like and dont like.

>The world doesnt have a huge hate boner for him. If you think so you are clearly only looking into leftist media. 

>There are things i disagree with Trump on, but that doesnt make him a bad president. Not even remotely. 

>Just because someone supports another person, that doesn't mean they agree with everything they do. Especially in the case of a president, it mainly just means that they are currently the best person running in that person's eyes. Which he is. Let me explain.

>If you are ok with immigrants just flocking to the country without any regulation you are ignorant to the facts. The facts are there are many people that want to harm American's and their way of life. This allows them easy access to the country. It's happening in places all over Europe rn and it spiked once they allowed immigrants without regulation.

>If you believe that is fear mongering then ok. What happens when a good majority of the motivated and driven people from these countries decide to move to America for better opportunities. Will that be good for their country at all?

>If you dont believe that is going to happen, fine. Then lets talk about something that is actually happening right now. What about the people coming here and avoiding taxes outright and then accepting government assistance. Even though these people have never payed into the system and plan on never paying. You cant tell me this isn't happening because I literally know someone who's mom came here illegally, is living on housing authority, is running an illegal salon from said house, and is renting it to her family sometimes. I literally know of a pizza place (that used to exist) that had about 5 Mexican immigrants living in the basement working from the time they woke up to the time they went to bed to bring money back to their family in Mexico. This example isnt just bad for the economy is bad for them as well. Allowing them unregulated access allows this to become common place. You can work these people to death for nothing and they cant do really anything about it. They arent covered by our constitution. They are not citizens. These people steal from those that pay into the system and end up on disability or something else. Its fucking wrong and can really only end badly. 

>Men shouldn't be able to compete in women's olympic events. Thats a given.

>2nd amendment rights are important. History has proven this.

>1st amendment rights even moreso.

>Other countries shouldn't be able to discriminate against gay people. Trump is pushing to make that happen. He is pushing to make it nationally illegal to criminalize someone for being gay. Idc what you say i think that's dope. https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-administration-launches-global-effort-end-criminalization-homosexuality-n973081 feel free to ignore any of the opinions on Trump they give here, I'm posting this because it does give more insight to the proposed bill. NBC is the news organization that was actually in contact with Trump officials about this topic. https://legalinsurrection.com/2019/02/trump-administration-developing-global-campaign-to-end-criminalization-of-homosexuality/

>Trump has passed a bill for a prison reform by passing the First Step Act. Here's a leftist article for you https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/18/18140973/state-of-the-union-trump-first-step-act-criminal-justice-reform

>Here is another link about the bill https://www.firststepact.org/about

>I do believe the war on drugs has failed though, and do not believe that the government should be able to control what someone wants to put into their body.

>I'm not going to be fined for not having health insurance though 🤙

>His candidacy was pretty insane; however, I dont believe he is the same person then as he is now.

>Edit: I also believe the state's should have a bit more control over the people living there than the federal government itself. Some things states have problems with somethings that others dont.",2019-06-23 13:51:29

ab951f,"Evil spirits are in alcohol. That's why God said don't get drunk and liquor stores call alcohol spirits. Then you're under the influence of evil spirits. 

Friends should draw you closer to holiness &  Jesus Christ. If they pull you towards sin more than holiness then you should walk away. Obey Jesus Christ over every person. See 1 Cor. 5:9-11 which says that Christians should not even eat with Christians that fornicate or are drunkards. 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 says that fornicators and drunkards will not inherit the Kingdom of God. 

1 Peter 4:7 The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers.

1 Peter 5:8 Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.

Ephesians 5:18 Don’t be drunk with wine, because that will ruin your life. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit, 

My advice as an ex-addict that quit everything for Jesus: Go to church. Study scripture. Ask God to help you quit. Sobriety is key to letting God's Holy Spirit work on our hearts for the benefit of ourselves and mankind. Studying God's word fills our hearts with himself, his love, his light and his wisdom. God's word is God. Be like Jesus. Fasting and praying for God breaks strongholds that the devil has on us. Humble yourself and confess your sins and pray for God to free you from your addiction in Jesus' name with complete faith that God loves you and will definitely deliver you. Then commit to quitting with God's help. His Holy Spirit inside you will help you. If you quit something for God you will see him break the chains off of you. Remember that we are either a slave to sin or righteousness. Obedience to God brings his blessings. Trust God's word, will and timing. Ungodly addictions have evil spirits behind them. Jesus Christ can free you. Friends should draw you closer to holiness and Jesus Christ. If they pull you towards sin more than holiness then you should walk away. Please share with your friends and family on social media. 🙏Secular music & TV programs everyone to enjoy sinful thoughts. Strive for holiness and glorify God with your thoughts & behavior. Be rapture ready. 🙏 ",2023-02-21 06:07:00

iot7r0,That’s not true. My son is one of 9 grandkids and is the ONLY boy. When my sister became pregnant I asked to do a gender reveal and the whole family was so anxious and excited to find out. I made a model rocket that dropped the powder when the parachute came out. It was twenty bucks but my sister and her husband LOVE space and nasa and such. It’s a fun way to share the gender. I don’t feel like shitting on people for wanting to do that is very fair. 🤷🏻‍♀️ if nobody cared they wouldn’t show up.,2020-09-08 15:41:36
iot7r0,"Yep, from Facebook:

A weird thing came up on Twitter, so I figured I'd share here. Someone remembered it was me who ""invented"" the gender reveal party. I had written about my party on my blog and a parenting forum in July 2008. It was picked up & and an interview with me was published in The Bump magazine and the idea kinda spread from there. I've got the article framed!

Anyway, I've felt a lot of mixed feelings about my random contribution to the culture. It just exploded into crazy after that. Literally - guns firing, forest fires, more emphasis on gender than has ever been necessary for a baby. 

Who cares what gender the baby is? I did at the time because we didn't live in 2019 and didn't know what we know now - that assigning focus on gender at birth leaves out so much of their potential and talents that have nothing to do with what's between their legs. 

PLOT TWIST, the world's first gender-reveal party baby is a girl who wears suits!

Humble yourself and confess your sins and pray for God to free you from your addiction in Jesus' name with complete faith that God loves you and will definitely deliver you. Then commit to quitting with God's help. His Holy Spirit inside you will help you. If you quit something for God you will see him break the chains off of you. Remember that we are either a slave to sin or righteousness. Obedience to God brings his blessings. Trust God's word, will and timing. Ungodly addictions have evil spirits behind them. Jesus Christ can free you. Friends should draw you closer to holiness and Jesus Christ. If they pull you towards sin more than holiness then you should walk away. Please share with your friends and family on social media. 🙏Secular music & TV programs everyone to enjoy sinful thoughts. Strive for holiness and glorify God with your thoughts & behavior. Be rapture ready. 🙏 ",2023-02-21 06:09:05

Especially the poor baby girls barely 11,12 who have already been rap*d once by their predator and then been ra*ed again by the INJUSTICE system.

Fuq all these fascist theocratic terrorists of Christian ISIS with a cactus 🌵 sideways.

I'm old, my eggs have long been permanently scrambled so it's not going to affect me, but it WILL affect not only the 5 beautiful girls in my life, but every other girl and woman.

And where there's one injustice, there's absolutely no justice for anyone else.

Don't THINK I wouldn't straight up defy these MFs and help girls and women obtain safe abortions, because I absolutely will.

Once you get to my age, life in prison ain't exactly a long time.

I used to be a guard/escort for PP at two of THE most contentious sites in the nation, one having its own documentary about how violent the pro forced birthers get, and it's bad. Didn't scare me away from it then, they won't be scaring me away now.
I survived Reagan& Bush's evil regimes, I can survive anything. 

I myself have had an abortion, best decision I could have made at the time, I regret nothing and would absolutely do it again with no hesitation. Anyone not liking that fact can GFY and yeet into the sun for all I care . 

These stupid MF have NO idea just what kind of Hellbeasts they've unleashed by doing this ish.

She got a good bit of child support from him and like 60% custody or something of their son. She hated her ex and would always complain about him, saying he’s a bad dad and saying things like how he’d do things like ask her to pay 1/2 the price for their son’s clothes when he took him back-to-school shopping, even though he just bought a boat and has the money and stuff. She hated that her son had to spend time at his dad’s because she doesn’t think he takes good care of him, so she convinces her parents to pay for her lawyer fees to take him to court for more custody/more child support. Her parents agreed and ended up spending ~$30k by the time it was through and her parents were both school teachers… that was a good chunk of money to them. 

She tells her ex husband that she’s taking him to court and he got his own lawyer and came in there with receipts. He ended up showing the whole court (with her parents there) pictures of a bunch of her nudes that she was sending random guys, tons of texts and proof of her being drunk around their kid often and bringing random men around him, etc. So he mom and dad saw her full nude photos and the texts she was sending to her booty calls 😭 The judge ended up taking custody away from her entirely and ordered HER to pay her ex husband child support instead of him paying her more money like she wanted.

fpzj97,"Depends on the system. I live in Denmark and we have ""the danish model"". Unions (almost) everywhere and most of the people are member of such. Problem is that many of the younger people (born around the 90s or later) don't know what the unions fought for. They started working in a world where they have 6 weeks of vacation (5 weeks or 25 days a year by law and another 5 days from the union), a 37 hour work week, parental leave (52 weeks from birth, depending on the union 4-8 weeks before due date), payed while being sick (and not even have to go to the doctor, it's simply based on trust), payed salary for moving day, payed salary when getting married and not coming to work, payed when attending a funeral of a close family member, senior days (up to 5 days a year when born before 195something....) etc. They thought all these things are just essential and will be there forever. So when it's up to the union to negotiate a new contract between the state and them, then they do nothing. Union will fix this. Or worse: most of them aren't in a union but live off these benefits because their workplace has a contract with the union. All these things people have fought really really hard for. 100 years ago a lot of people sacrificed a lot, 50 years ago they sacrificed a lot, 30 years ago they sacrificed a lot. And here, we are standing and fight every 4th year to just keep those rights alive while a lot of people turn their backs on unions but live off the benefits. Of those rights are gone, they're gone.
But that's the danish way. German way is different, French way is different, even Swedish way is different, so you can't copy systems but you can learn a lot from each other (and hopefully it's not that we learn from the USA regarding their worker's rights or lack of such 😜)",2020-03-27 23:06:21

You can negotiate better rates for things like car insurance and in some cases even rent then take the difference and save it.

Also, pay for EVERYTHING YOU CAN on a cash back credit card and pay it off each month you'll be able to pocket 1-5% of all your expenses back, tax-free.

It doesn't sound like much but if you're paying just $1500/mo in bills and food that's $15-75/mo back or $180-900/yr. and you may have options to increase nthe payout value of the cash back you've earned. I pay for Christmas this way most years.

i17avg,"Far too many people in the country lack the critical thinking skills enough to understand it’s not wise to get your information from a guy who contradicts himself on the regular. Seems obvious, but we are taught what to know not how to think and once we lose the need for the information we once knew it starts to fade away. Especially in a world full of distractions like the one we’re living in for the first time ever now. Better education could have helped prevent a ton of destruction in this country but this is what we get when teachers who are in control of the future generations of this country qualify for food stamps on the salary we give them. Some in power SAY that they care but the actions, or lack there of speak otherwise when these are the results. and we are STILL teaching in a fashion designed for the ever dying factory worker jobs 🤦🏻‍♂️",2020-07-31 20:50:03

Trump exposed the swamp and the people just listened to the corrupt for profit media instead of actually democratically elected leaders and exposing corruption from small gov upto fed level. Ya know, being proactive and forthcoming. But truth be told the rich just enriched themselves more, remember when obama had the economic crash and he bailed out the banks and didnt jail anyone... Well here we are whilst the riches of all get bailouts, likes of elon musk are telling us its no t in our best interests to get handouts as no such thing as too big to fail gets a bailout....

I decided to check that, and found this:

>**Q.** Is the epinephrine auto-injector a substitute or authorized generic for other “branded” epinephrine auto-injectors?

>**A.** Lineage Therapeutics’ epinephrine auto-injector is an authorized generic for Adrenaclick®. As to substitution, drug and generic drug substitution regulations are overseen by individual states. Since each state has its own laws and rules governing drug substitution, you should discuss the issue of substitution of an epinephrine auto-injector with your pharmacist and physician.

So if the actual law dictates a specific epinephrine injector, then again, this is the fault of lawmakers. Nobody else.",2016-08-26 00:26:19

de272s,"Great article. I'd like to highlight the part about how they're actively funding harmful ideas, bolded for emphasis.

> But perhaps the worst offense Komen commits is ... their steadfast insistence on promoting mammograms as The Solution (™) to breast cancer. They were **called out by experts in the British Medical Journal** for spreading a highly misleading statistic that claimed women who got mammograms were vastly more likely to survive their cancer than women who did not. When Komen was originally founded in the 1980s, mammograms were touted as being the best tool to help women find tumors earlier and therefore to save lives. But we now know that that's not true.

> Women who get mammograms in their 40s and 50s decrease their chance of dying from breast cancer by tiny fractions of a percent. What's worse is that **for every one women in 2,000 whose life is prolonged by early detection, 10 women are overdiagnosed who are otherwise healthy.**

> The problem with mammograms is that they detect a lot of potentially problematic spots that might never actually become problems. Some cancers are so slow-growing that old age will kill you first, others might not grow at all, and still more might go away on their own. Detecting these ""cancers"" early just means that **women go through surgery and radiation potentially for nothing, receiving plenty of negative—even life-threatening—side effects from a treatment that they never needed**.

> And yet despite all the evidence, Susan G. Komen continues to spend many millions of dollars spreading the word that women need to be getting mammograms early and often. They've funneled a disproportionate amount of their effort into raising awareness about detection, despite the fact that most breast cancer deaths aren't from tumors in the breast at all. Early stage breast cancer is highly survivable. It's the metastatic recurrences that kill people. And finding the lump three years earlier isn't what could save you—it's the treatments for recurrences that researchers are desperately trying to develop, and who could use more funding.

No, stats is all. about. the. theory. And honestly,  the way math is taught in the United States elementary and high school is my learning most math concepts as a series of steps instead of the theory behind it. That's why so many people struggle with stats when they get to college.

Financially, for example. I think we can agree there's a LOT of unnecessary government spending. That doesn't mean I support Trump cutting the pandemic team right before a pandemic because the problem wasn't right in front of him. Some costs are insurance and shouldn't be cut. Meanwhile I estimate we could cut 1/3 of military spending and still be the biggest military in the world and lose little to no strategic advantage we have.

It's not really hard to see what happened and why you're so specifically bitter about cheating. You thought you had it all figured out with this guy, you were trying to learn techniques to manipulate him more to be your ideal partner (super fucked up lol). You thought that you were just a few months away from moulding the perfect man, something you've probably been fantasizing about since you were a little girl. You thought you were the nice girl you're referring to above.

Then you found out he cheated on you. Why? Because you are fuckin insane lol, you're certified batshit crazy, you might be fun in bed (probs why he kept you around for as long as he did) but once that wore off the poor guy was stuck with a hot mess of emotionally manipulative PMS and tight dresses. He saw thru you then if not earlier and went looking for emotional comfort and support from someone who was actually capable of giving it to him. And guess what? He fucked the absolute shit out of that person because there is nothing sexier than someone who takes an interest in you emotionally and wants to make things better. 

You blame him for the cheating, you blame all men, all cheaters for their actions as evidenced in this thread, because that easier than accepting the fact that your guy cheated on you because of you, your personality, and your actions. 

You'll die sad and alone unless you come to terms with this fact and start making changes. Solve your mental health issues and then maybe you'll be viewed as girlfriend/wife material by someone you want to be with. Def not happening until then.

It doesn’t obligate the government to fund the post, or even to have a post.  It just gives them the right to establish post offices.

That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t fund the post office because of course we should.  I am not sure our society would even function without the postal service.  The postal service provides mail service to literally every resident and business in the country, no matter how remote, at low costs.  

It’s absolutely insane that our congress hasn’t funded the postal service already.  They don’t need the presidents signature if they get a filibuster proof majority, and “mail service” ought to be one of those bipartisan issues I keep reading about.

All I’m saying is if you’re citing article 1, you are admitting that right now, the system is working as intended.  Congress gets to do what they are doing. 😡",2020-08-15 19:52:54

>the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed  
>  
>."" is the main part of the second amendment.

 ""**A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free  State**, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be  infringed."" 

If it were the main part then perhaps it should have been before ""a well regulated militia"" 🤔 Since when has the main part of something come later in the list, and would such a method work in this case? And does that comma really make sense if you're just looking for ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms?"" Did the Founding Father's English omit ""and"" between commas? Such as, did they intend it to be, ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, and the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed?"" Wherein we can remove ""being necessary to the security of a free State"" to make sense as it's just filler words to explain their reasoning.

""A well regulated Militia, and the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"" makes sense with the and, but without the ""and"" it doesn't really make grammatical sense. ""A well regulated Militia, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Does that grammatically make sense? We can remove ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms"" and it'll still make sense regardless of the filler information.  
""A well regulated Militia shall not be infringed"" we no longer need the comma and it still makes sense. We no longer need a comma because we got rid of the nonrestrictive clause

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, shall not be infringed"" makes sense.

Grammatically it doesn't make sense, although if you can make it make sense I'd love to see it so I can enlighten my ignorance. I don't see how that's the main part of the second amendment on a grammatical basis.",2020-08-15 23:39:38

6shozk,"Doubt this will get noticed, but as someone who's attempted to sell to Disney in the past, this isn't surprising at all. I'll preface the following by saying I love the Disney experience as a consumer, very much so. Ok, short story time. 

Disney approached a company I used to work for as we had a unique (at the time) piece of technology they absolutely needed. I was part of the sales process, as selling to a company of Disney's size can require various folks to keep things moving along favorably. We were a small company, but doing well. 

We had several meetings with various Disney teams overseeing their hotels. They put us through some very rigorous due diligence, which isn't uncommon with large deals like these in our industry. All along the way we received nothing but positive buying signals. 

Months go by, countless conversations, meetings, feature reviews/requests, etc.  Out of the blue they tell us they are no longer interested and they're confident they can build the same solution in-house. 

Cool. They tried, and they failed. There's something to be said for specialization. 

Come to learn shortly thereafter they had done the same to several other tech providers in our space. Not competitors to us, but completely different providers. They have a horrible reputation and many companies have blacklisted them for this very reason, ourselves included. 

They burn your hours and effort and then *try* to shit on you. Once they attempt the project they pour piles of cash into development and they a) create a shit tier hack or b) fail entirely. 

Yeah, not surprised by this at all. But I'll probably sign up because I have Disney-aged kids and I love their stuff too 😁. ",2017-08-09 03:12:32

nzuqo3,Yea this is how my real estate agent did it when I was looking to buy a condo. Probably more than half of the larger apartment buildings have a bunch of those lockboxes in the lobby or on the outside somewhere so you can open them up and get in to individual apartments.

Oh noes, emojis. What a flawless argument to the systemic issues facing minorities in America.

>The Christian part is nonsense...I’m not Christian and very few people I know are actually practicing Christians and we all get by just fine.

If you live in a city maybe, but people who live in more rural areas (or areas dominated by the shittiest kinds of Christians) you aren't going to be so lucky.

>If you need medical care, you can and will get it. Stop acting like people are being kicked out of hospitals to die in the streets.

I never said they'd throw you out of the hospital. Nice strawman, though. Better put that perty thang out in the corn field!

You might not get thrown out, but you *will* be in serious debt if you need anything beyond basic medical care. Basic medical care that a lot of people struggle to get.

>Don’t be poor. Work hard. Bootstraps. Etc. 

Congratulations, you just fixed all poverty! This is as good of advice as ""stop being sad"" to depressed people! (MASSIVE /s in case that flew over your head)

>Political affiliation is irrelevant as far as how your life is in America. 

Day-to-day yes. However America currently has this issue where loads of people are shooting up schools and other public areas due to political reasons.

>Stop it with the hyperbole.

Anyway.....if you are a real person I will let you get back to your anthropology textbook so you can get your useless liberal arts degree that costs 250k. I guess it won't matter though because Bernie wants taxpayers to pay off all the loans that dumbass libtards voluntarily take on by getting useless degrees...so you're good. Seriously though....if you're not a Bernie bot then you seriously haven't been to much of the world. I know that for a fact. There is no country that protects liberty around the world like America.

dc1f5t,"Literally worked in the movie industry for a while. Home entertainment in the UK. We've seen distributors go out of business because sales on home ent declined. Watched as you promote indie theatrical releases and comments have been ""oh (friend name) can you get it on kodi?"" Or some other such device.

It's demoralising to work on non studio projects but because people can't see beyond ""hollywood can afford it"" they don't realise jobs are being lost around the world at an alarming rate in the film industry.

Lost my job for the same sort of reason. Decline in sales etc. The fox/disney merger is the scariest... thousands of jobs worldwide lost. Not just within those companies but more than likely the agencies fox used worldwide who have now lost huge contracts in social media, building management (cleaners, security etc).

If you have to abort the baby to save the mother go for it but its not ok to abort babies simply out of convenience. 

Jones said he's a ""firm believer that a woman should have to freedom to choose what happens to her own body.""

""I'm going to stand up for that, and I'm going to make sure that that continues to happen,"" he said. ""I want to make sure that as we go forward, people have access to contraception, they have access to the abortion that they might need, if that's what they choose to do.""

""So you wouldn't be in favor of legislation that said, ban abortion after 20 weeks or something like that?"" Todd asked.

All talk and no walk from a pussy ass bitch. You can't find such studies because they don't exist. Conservatives have lower cognitive ability and that's a fact repeatedly proven in academia. Numerous studies also prove that Democrats are better for the economy. You responded with exactly what you got, WHICH IS NOTHING.

LOL, you've never had an ounce of my intelligence, so you're clearly talking out of your ass. You're just a giant fucking idiot but I'm glad you've been so adamant in trying to prove it.

*""The extremist-related murders in 2018 were overwhelmingly linked to right-wing extremists.

i2nc13,"> Some non-violent prisoners have been released (like maybe in on weed charges or treason or whatever 😜)

This isn't totally true, at least in California, the release is broader in scope:

>  Most of the 8,000 state prison inmates eligible for release fall into one of four categories:

> * 4,800 inmates with 180 days or less left on their sentences for a nonviolent, non-sex crime
* Nonviolent inmates over the age of 30 with a year or less left on their sentence, and who are being held in a prison deemed to be housing “large populations of high-risk patients,” including San Quentin
* 2,100 inmates benefiting from a one-time 12-week custody credit for good behavior, excluding those on life-without-parole or death sentences
* “High risk” inmates with serious health ailments that make them especially vulnerable to contracting or dying from COVID-19, including inmates over the age of 65

https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/07/10/coronavirus-upward-of-8000-state-prison-inmates-be-released-in-wake-of-san-quentin-outbreak/

Worth noting also that there is a campaign going on right now to pressure the state to release more prisoners from San Quentin (which has the only death row in the state)

https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/02/san-quentin-protestors-demand-action-as-prison-outbreak-continues/

I'm not editorializing my opinions on this one way or another, because I don't know the solution. It's not an easy problem and it's not right just leave people to die in prison from illness. At the same time, it's not fair to the victims of *some* of these people to say that they're in prison on a bullshit charge.",2020-08-03 04:47:18

j4xny3,"I think that the better option is to ask the friend if it's ok to give their number to that person.

I one time asked a friend if she could give me the number of a friend of hers that I'd just meet briefly. I had never met the friend before, but I felt like our little bit of conversation was just great, and I wanted to talk more.
I asked for the number. I knew that there's no way my friend would give out the number without checking. Thus, if she called back and said ""Sorry, I can't give out the number,""  then I would know her friend wasn't interested in me. Instead, she called back with number. So I knew I was in! 😎

trump was a fluke, but he was passionate about getting elected. the guy brought serious energy to the room at every one of his rallies. he wanted to be president when he realized it was possible.

the fact bloomberg just stepped up like this to the national stage after being mayor of NYC is the most power move of all time. he knows the DNC is in shambles and all he had to do was grab power, kinda like how trump did it by knocking out all the other candidates in 2016.

Most americans don’t trade stocks in any way. Retirement funds are specifically established to track upwards over decades, and are not meant to be traded or dissolved in any way until you actually retire.

Just because you have a robinhood account doesn’t mean you represent 99% of America that either a) don’t own a single stock or b) don’t touch their retirement fund at all until 40 years have passed.

(For clarification, the man was in his 50s, I was in my early 20s, and he obviously never listened to me when I talked because I talked about my husband and kids all the freaking time.) 

About 10 years ago, I went,  ""Fuck it, I'm not wearing something I hate,"" and stopped wearing a ring altogether. 

I've just always made sure to reference ""my husband"" in passing as early in a conversation as possible if a guy seems like he's just making pleasant conversation.  If the guy was obviously hitting on me, I'd try to say something like,  ""I'm not saying you're into me, but just to be clear,  I am married with 4 kids."" (I learned that if you throw the kids part in, the guy feels like he dodged a bullet instead of feeling offended that I rebuffed him.)

That seems to have worked fairly well, but I also don't spend a lot of time in places where guys might try to pick me up because I also have trouble filtering out excess talking and noise, so bars and clubs are just stressful for me, not fun (plus, I'm in my 40s now, so guys hitting on me is way less of a problem than it once was 😅).",2022-04-05 16:10:48

Except it's not just Americans that view time that way. 

The fact that time is the x-axis on a chart or graph and goes forward to the right is virtually universal.

You’re also quite woke in assuming I’ve lived a privileged life lol. If you want to call immigrating from the slums of India and busting my ass through school to make a better life for myself, then yes, I’m privileged. 

You call me assumptive yet all in one comment you’ve assumed:

* I don’t believe in protesting
* I don’t believe peaceful protests helped build America
* I’m unaccomplished (likely just projection making up for your lack of accomplishments so you turn to Reddit for some sort of “woke” superiority complex)
* I’m okay with the status quo

bdjjra,"Right, we know those exist. The point is that as the technology stands, the water flow can’t be controlled from aircraft, so for structures like the cathedral, the high pressures from the weight of the water can cause more damage and endanger rescue efforts on the ground. 

The other issue is that using aircraft for fire fighting currently isn’t really feasible in most areas, because by the time they can get an aircraft prepped, staffed, and to the location, a truck will be able to beat them there. (Exceptions of course for rural areas.) 

What I’m imagining is an unmanned aircraft that can be remotely piloted (or if we’re really going future sci-fi tech, AI piloted), exists in every city, and has better control over the water spray so that it won’t cause additional damage or endanger workers on the ground.

Worked out well because in Canada, the CPA designation (I am currently enrolled in) is all self study and is carried out online, so I kinda have a leg up on my peers and it is one of the most respected designations you can have in finance.

dne6rk,But im in LA traffic and any space I give will be cut off by everyone... and then ill be 20 cars behind the original car....😥,2019-10-26 14:52:49
dne6rk,"I drive on the 405 everyday to work for about 20 miles and can say with confidence that LA’s traffic problem is caused by people getting into the number 1/2 lanes, going 60 mph, leaving 7 car lengths between them and the next car because they’re on their cell phone, and then waiting until their exit is 1 mile or less before starting to work their way over. I typically don’t like to tailgate because it’s dangerous but I get closer than normal when someone is doing less than 65 and I can see clearly that they are 5 car lengths back from the next car. 

When I get on the freeway and I know I’m going to be on it for at least 10 miles I smoothly make my way over to the #1 lane ONE LANE AT A TIME, and then I work my way back over toward the exit 2-3 miles beforehand. I don’t have to slow the entire lane down to get out of the 1, I can safely transition towards my exit at speed, but a majority of LA drivers are simply brain dead and wait too long to move towards their exit and/or try to fly over 2-3 lanes in a single change.

Now that I'm married, holidays are so stressful because my husband's family has so many expectations on how they're spent and I feel so guilty that I just want to relax and enjoy them with my husband in our own home, and he feels the same.

I'd be happy for anyone who wants to see us to stop by and I don't understand why they think that's unreasonable when that's the exact thing they expect from us.

I'm considering just putting my foot down about it next year and doing all holidays at our house with an open invitation, and otherwise we'll stop by to spend some time with them the weekend after. They're always just so passive aggressive about how ""they never see us"" and I'm just like ??? WE SEE YOU ALL THE TIME. And also, they've NEVER come by to see us at our place.

kuj79s,"Last weekend I was directly exposed to the Covid-19 virus (Jan 1-3)! I found this out ~5 pm  on Tuesday (Jan 5), I've been home since ~9 pm that evening, at 7:40 am Wed (Jan 6) I called my health care provider and reported this, I was told immediately to quarantine, after getting off of the phone with the nurse who was handling the Covid-19 issues I immediately called our local health department, again I was told I was in quarantine, at ~noon on Wed (Jan 6) my health care provider nurse called me and set up a Covid-19 test for 8:30 am Mon morning (Jan 11), I have received 2 letters from the health department since - one saying I'm off of work until Fri (Jan 15) and the other stating I can return to work after  Fri (Jan 15) but only if my Covid-19 test is negative! As of this moment I have had no symptoms - I've been taking my temperature twice a day and keeping notes on how I feel! Because of my age and some underlying health issues I'm on the list with my health care provider to receive the vaccine (I've been told I'll receive the Moderna vaccine but I don't know the date). 

This has been very difficult on me! Physically I'm fine but mentally, on so many levels, this has been very difficult for me (thank goodness I have a great core support team)! 

I found out the person who exposed me to this virus knew their family had it and on Fri Jan 1 the person had started to feel ill! There were family members who had already tested positive for Covid-19 as early as Dec 30 - Jan 1. 2 people from that family continued to be in our ""bubble"" and announced the whole family was sick on Facebook on Tues (Jan 5)! Yesterday I heard the entire family is very ill! 15 people are in quarantine, including myself, that I'm aware of because of the actions of these people. Some people who are not quarantined but exposed are choosing to not be tested but some are! 

Up until now I've tried to take all of this as seriously as I possibly can! I wear a mask religiously (in fact I give masks and gloves away to people in need), my hands are raw from all the handwashing and sanitizer, I spend lots of money on Lysol spray and wipes and clean religiously, I've done an overhaul of my entire life and I haven't seen my son and his family since Nov, 2019! 

I've tried to stay as positive as I can because I know that is good for my general health! Thank goodness I'm overall healthy despite my underlying issues! Because of my anxiety and depression this experience has really affected my mental health and I'm sure I'll deal with this for a very long time in therapy! 

Above all, I can't come up with genuine caring feelings for this family who is ill. I feel I'll never be able to trust most people for so many reasons ever again! I try to live my life in a caring, loving and giving manner and this experience has changed me from whom I once was! How can people be so disrespectful, uncaring and narcissistic to do this to others? I couldn't live with myself if I had knowingly done something like this to someone else! I believe in karma - positive and negative - and is this an example of karma at work for this family? 

Thanks for listening to me, I hope everyone will try to be as safe and healthy as possible! Good luck... 🤞",2021-01-11 00:53:53

9wibid,It honestly surprised me 😂,2018-11-13 02:58:14
9wibid,"> Fun fact: if a gay man introduces you to his hot female friends he’s probably setting you up.

I know that this is a narrative we sold straight society so that they would like us. I know it's a good thing to have come this far. And I know that Queer Eye is back and just as fabulous as before.

But... this idea still makes me cringe. Just a bit. It's like... not true most of the time. We don't live our lives trying to figure out how to hook random straight men up with our female friends. We just... don't.

If an introduction leads to you hitting it off by chance, okay great. But if you creep on them you're uninvited. That's how it goes.

I'm just saying, in the 25 years I spent living like a gay man before my transition began, I cock blocked a lot of straight men, and only set up a select few that I really knew well and trusted around my friends.

Also, on a somewhat related note...

I've definitely had straight male acquaintances pull me aside asking if I can help them get a shot at my female friends. If you're wondering if that's awkward, it is (though, don't worry, I will do everything I can to make it less so for us all).

First, the answer is always ""I don't know what she thinks about you, we talk about things like politics and law and algorithms and titties and glitter. And just generally not you."" 

Second, just consider it. You're asking a gay guy for advice about your straight game? Girl, I'm a literal trash can of advice on that front.

I'm like ""I don't know dude, send her a woof on Scruff? Maybe send her a pig nose emoji 🐽and ask her if she likes fisting. That's always worked for me.""

She could look me in the face and tell me she loved me and could not ever think about being with someone else.
They have no empathy, it's crazy to me that there are people out there that could hurt another human being like this. It's mental abuse and it causes trauma.

You’re talking a easily walkable, very safe, not heavily trafficked neighborhood with high chances of full sized bars based on the houses. If I don’t get a shit ton of trick or treaters here, I’ll never get that experience 😭",2022-11-02 00:11:22

Oh, well. I don't know anything 😂 
Street was sporadic in who was handing out candy . Some houses were all out and myself and next door neighbors were just sitting on our porches. One neighbor had been out but then went inside and it appeared bucket had been left out. It LOOKED like the kids behaved themselves (along with parents). Handfuls helped and still had some left over for me (and extra for my sister just to get rid of some of the extra).
Then I went and got more of my preferred today when I had to run to get milk because it was discounted.

But yeah some of these posts griping about it... I mean seriously. You left a bucket full of candy on the porch. There's more than likely to be some kid that will take it. They're kids. They CAN be jerks.
Adults as well.
Don't act surprised that it happened. (I'd be more surprised if it didn't)",2022-11-02 01:38:23

I hadn't planned on leaving my basket of full-size bars and applesauce pouches out, but figured since we'd be out for 15 minutes taking our kids trick-or-treating for the first time so NBD. I was very sad to find out it was stolen by some asshole with Cruella DeVille hair at 6:01pm.

yjhywo,Yeah I only see this being a problem if you live in a small town where there’s not a lot of houses to get candy from.

ctuesp,"Please, you pointless plebeian. you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2019-08-22 14:22:58

ctuesp,"Went to Japan for my honeymoon. We loved it and wish we can go back. We stayed in Shibuya for the majority of the time, but also visited Komatsu to stay in a ryokan. It is beautiful.

My favorite part was actually just walking around the city. We woke up super early every day (thankful for jetlag in that case lol) and went to a park. People would just sit there during their own commute and stare out into the park or read their books, and it was *silent*. So many people and cars, but it never sounded or smelled atrocious.

You clearly aren’t comprehending what I’m trying to say. You, specifically, are the reason the democrats have trouble getting someone elected to high office.

a5pxw1,"In college 12 years ago, I was one of four girls in a class of 20-something students. A group of us would go drink at the bar next to the school after class. One of the guys in my class was really creepy with me, staring at me for hours, following me around, making gross comments about my body. The instructors were aware of this but there was nothing they could do as it never got physical 🙄

One of the other guys in my class invited the creep to come drink with us because he thought it would be funny to see me squirm. So I left the bar early and told him how uncool this was. No one was friends with the creep, it was all a joke. The guy who had invited him was 30, I was 26 and some of the others in our class were between 18-44, yet no one really stood up for me, they just went along with the joke. 

Whenever they would go to the bar, I’d get made fun of for saying if the creep was going, then I wasn’t. 

Really fucked with my social life for that first semester until the creep flunked out and didn’t return. 

So now if someone doesn’t want to participate in a group outing, I let them know they will be missed and I understand and respect their decision. It isn’t hard to show kindness, ffs.",2018-12-13 07:04:56

The only time she's ever annoying about it is when she sees a charge for something you actually have to have like say, lawnmower oil or whatever at a hardware store.

Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement, characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation and race ...

Authoritarian ✅

Dictatorial leader ✅

Are you rly trying to gloat over it?  Sorry I can't hear you over the hum from being surrounded by loving family for the holiday.

#What do people with no life even spend overtime money on? 🤑

Edit :*""b- but nono cant you see your family other days??""*

Ya except for the fact everyone is generally you know working outside of the holidays. That's kind of the point of seeing family on holidays-its convenient Cuz you generally get time off, they're not all weirdos who would rather whore themselves out to a corporation for time and a half

bpjosc,"The one who's mother decides to have one. I understand that no matter what you cannot make something 100% illegal. Given that there is any desire for abortion operations I am obstinately against making them illegal. Illegalized abortion will lead to

1. Black market abortions of varying levels of sketchiness, the more vulnerable the woman(poor, minority, sex worker etc) the worse of a black market abortion she's likely to get

2. Self abortions by ingesting/smoking whatever, might be just drinking/smoking during pregnancy, problems likely to arise: 
""didn't actually abort fetus just gave it ALLL the problems"" Or they consume something more dangerous and possibly the woman damages or kills herself in the process.

3. People that follow the law, more kids in an overly full fostercare/adoption system

4. Women that decide to keep the baby only after birth. All kinds of hormones push the mother in this direction, but if the mother was going to give the baby away for a good reason (abusive spouse, low income etc) this will result in more kids growing up in bad situations

I don't like the idea of abortion in general, but I am realistic about the results of banning such procedures.


JokeEDIT: this topic is grim
Another comment suggests the letter of the law specifies it's only illegal to abort once you know you are pregnant so....   

Obfuscated medical procedures a woman thinks she may be pregnant, she makes sure not to take a test, goes to her doctor explains her concerns and gives the Dr.  her preferred option if she is pregnant, doctor checks and goes through the procedure if necessary, never informing the woman involved if she is pregnant 😂",2019-05-17 11:07:17

bpjosc,"> People think the right is horrible for trying to protect life. It’s what some people believe in and those people voted together for these laws. They need to be educated and so does the left. You can’t have total control of your body when you kick started a life after having consented sex. If you are healthy there has to be a limit to the types of abortions that may be performed. The left takes life starting at birth as a fact and completely ignore that’s the rights argument that it doesn’t ffs.

Did you read my original comment? I’m not saying to make abortion illegal. 

I’m personally only against economical abortions. To people who consider life at conception it’s like changing your mind about keeping your one year old because his insurance cost too much. But apparently not too many people consider them life. It’s disturbing to our side and to see the left attack the idea of life starting at conception and then say it’s all about controlling women. The reason I’m against economical abortion is the vector of abuse that can arise from the stem cells found in aborted fetuses . 

I’m also worried about abuse from sensational laws being passed from BOTH sides in the future. One side is completely wrong (making it illegal) and the other side wants the government to look away. There’s been a huge amount of advancement in gene manipulation and stem cell research. Your kids may soon be competing with genetically modified kids. The more laws that we pass that diminishes humanity from sperm and egg the more daring the experiments the government can get away with. My body, my gene modification rights? 

I’m sure the US Military is paying close attention to this topic. Considering this can be used to lower civilian casualties when pregnant women only count as ☝️and the loss of a fetus experiment won’t count as the death of a U.S citizen with rights.",2019-05-17 23:20:38
bpjosc,"Right so is the doctor applying the lethal treatment guilty of murder then?

Why is the mother deserving of death for making a bodily choice? You’re giving women one choice. Have the baby or suicide. You’re so full of shit you’re eyes are brown.

Btw, Nice try, trying to call people who don't approve of suicide bombs, racist.  No one is saying anyone is going to get kicked out of the the US.  If you're a citizen you're a citizen.

 Last I checked the definition of an ""immigrant"" is someone who is not a citizen of what ever country they're trying to enter. How many immigrants have you housed in your own home (answer: zero).  

I already stated to make immigration policy in the US like that of Japan or Australia. Both of those policies are far stricter than anything America has right now. 
Keep on trying to make shit up, makes your argument all the weaker. 
You guys love over saturating trigger words like ""Nazi"" and ""racist"" because you know it elicits a certain emotion for others who have no idea what's going on. 
So much for using weak ad hominems to help justify your delusional narrative.

8csm96,"Working in Korea teaching ESL and I’ve seen some hilarious names.

A lot of times the Korean parents have no idea how an already existing name is supposed to be spelled/pronounced. For example

Julio (they refused to pronounce it properly at first and wanted us to pronounce it with a J instead of an H sound 🙄)

Eavan (I explained how this isn’t how you spell Evan and it’s not even phonetically correct, yet he still signs his name with this spelling 🤨)

Ireen (not bad, phonetically correct, but no one really spells it this way)

Chrystal (this one is fine, it just reminds me of Chrysler)


Or even worse, when they parents let their kids pick their own name the results are sometimes HORRIBLE:

Tinkerbell (She’s so shy and everyone makes fun of her for her name she picked when she was like 4.)

Master (After the teacher called and told them it was unacceptable to call a child Master, he changed his name to Spino, after a fucking dinosaur.)

I write how I’m feeling, why I’m feeling that way, and just find a million different ways to describe my emotions and why I’m having the intrusive thoughts. By the time I’m done writing, I feel better. I originally started doing it as a way to log the progression of my depression, and wouldn’t ya know, these days, more and more months go by between each episode. And I get through every single one of them. I’ve just learned to embrace the thought instead of trying to shove it off. And now I have way fewer of them. Writing and just *feeling* whatever it is you’re feeling whether it’s good or bad is just extremely therapeutic. I wish you all the best moving forward!!

1271swf,"Trump slept with a porn star. After the ""grab her by the pussy"" tape hit the media Trump went on TV and said that was the only bad thing he'd ever done. The porn star was going to come forward but the National Enquirer (tabloid rag) tipped Trump off that she was shopping the story.

Instead of just buying her silence which would have been legal, he got his lawyer to do it with his own money (an illegal campaign contribution). Then he had his campaign ""hire"" his lawyer to pay him back, writing off the expense as lawyer fees (violation of campaign finance laws and tax evasion).

His lawyer already went to prison for this in 2018. There's audio tape of them discussing it. There's zero doubt he's guilty, it was a matter of if the prosecutor in New York would stand up to someone so powerful. He did because America is awesome 💪and we respect LAW AND ORDER.

mrci2l,"Hi there folks! Today I'm going to show you how to change an oil filter on a 2015 Dodge Ram 1500! First let me give you a brief back story about this pick-up.

I was born on a hot summer day in July 1987 in northwest Oklahoma. My father was a Russian cosmonaut and my mother was a horse thief. I've always liked the word cosmonaut and prefer it over astronaut! They wed in the late 70s at the local nudist dude ranch in front of a statue of Baphomet.

Anyway, I bought this truck 3 years ago from a Norwegian hamster trader 🐹. He told me he bought it new from a dealership in South Africa. He had a long story about how it got back to the states, which I will proceed to tell you now. 

*2 hours later...*

Anywho, now the pickup is in my custody for good after that brief run in with the law involving 20 kilos of cocaine. I'm sure you're wanting to know how to change that oil filter after that exhilarating  tale! 

So here's how I do it. You're going to need a rope and a second vehicle. I prefer nylon rope because it can grip harder than my cosmonaut father was when he made my mother pregnant. 

Tie the rope to the filter like so, and now tie the other end of the rope to another vehicle. I'm tying this end of the rope to a 2009 Grand Cherokee that I received from a tribal shaman in Bolivia. Actually, before I finish explaining how to remove the oil filter, let me tell you about how I acquired the Grand Cherokee...",2021-04-15 16:33:28

I was allergic to some ingredients and it was too much for my system to handle. I would get sick after the other vaccines, but the doctors said it was always normal. Well, the doctors in the hospital said that I probably shouldn’t have gotten any vaccines 🤷🏼‍♀️. Some doctors have blind faith and some doctors know to look at each individual case. Some kids react badly to vaccines and most don’t. It’s hard when there is a lot of misinformation and people who don’t vaccinate for the wrong reasons. If your kid reacts fine, by all means vaccinate. If they don’t react well, space it out or stop.

As an adult, I also read the book...and became a militant atheist, as I was reading with no understanding. I began looking for ways to prove it was wrong, starting with all the authors and great minds who debunked every bit they could ""debunk"".  At some point over several years, I realized that was a disingenuous way to seek proof. Confirmation bias and all. So I started looking at the other side. Beginning with the proof Jesus existed.

3 hours multiplied by 4 weeks per month multiplied by 100 dollars an hour 1200 bucks.

Im on disability now. I get 700 dollars and dont have to work. I lost my gaming job when i fulfilled the cashier training requirement to keep my housing.

mbrtii,Me who owns YouTube premium 👀,2021-03-24 16:01:22
mbrtii,"How to avoid ads on The Internet (everywhere)  - 2021

Step 1 - Mozilla Firefox is your friend.

Look, even with an ad blocker, Google Chrome will disable part of its functionality, and when that does not happen, it reports back to Google,  who owns YouTube, exactly how and why their ad did not play. You're always going to be on borrowed time when using Chrome as opposed to  Mozilla Firefox.

Step 2 -- Install uBlock Origin add-on.

Step 3 -- Install Nano Defender for Firefox (add-on) and follow the setup directions here [https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin](https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin)

Step 4 -- Open uBlock Origin's settings to enable ""Prevent WebRTC"" and ""Block  CSP.""  Proceed to move to the ""Filter List"" and enable ALL the filters.   Apply changes, purge cache, and update.

Step 5 -- Install the ""Privacy Badger"" add-on for Firefox.

Step 6 --  Install the ""SponsorBlock for YouTube - Skip Sponsorships"" add-on for Firefox.

Step 7 -- Enter the settings for ""SponsorBlock for YouTube - Skip  Sponsorships"" and enable ""Auto Skip"" for everything (or as you see fit).   Enable ""Support Invidious"" and approve the extension.  Go all the way  to the end and click ""SAVE.""

Step 8 -- Install the add-on ""Enhancer for YouTube™.""

Step 9 -- Enter the settings for ""Enhancer for YouTube"" and enable  ""Automatically remove ads,"" and be sure to grant permissions. Scroll  down to also enable ""Ads have been removed.""  -- The rest of the settings are up to you.

Step 10 -- Install the add-on ""Disable WebRTC,"" which will still protect you even if you need to disable your ad-blocker.

Step 11 -- Install the add-on  ""Google search link fix.""

Step 12 -- Install the add-on  ""Facebook Container.""Step 13 -- Install the add-on ""Smart HTTPS.""

Step 14 -- Enable ALL the above add-ons to work in ""Run in Private Windows."" --  This will make sure you're always protected (even when private browsing).

Step 14 -- Go to Firefox ""Preferences"" and disable both boxes under ""Recommended by Pocket.

""Step 15 -- Enable ""Do not track"" to ""Always.""

Step 16 -- Enable ""Allow Firefox to send backlogged crash reports on your behalf"" -- This is how we keep Firefox running smoothly in the future  (by helping report bugs and having them fixed).

&#x200B;

Your Internet experience now complies with my simple policy:  There are NO ads on The Internet.

Congratulations and enjoy!

But wait.... There is more....

ogfths,"I was asked to put together a spreadsheet to transition my work that was full of links to all my accounts when I resigned from my last job. Had a meeting with my boss and the person who’d take over and everything. 

On my last day, I deleted the doc in Google drive and then went to the trash folder to permanently delete the file before I turned in my computer. I heard they were not able to recover the file and had to manually find all that information from scratch again 🤷🏻‍♀️

Edit: Context is I endured a bad manager for 2+ years who harassed everyone on the team (both men and women, even touched one of my coworkers inappropriately). My teammate sued the company and got some cash from winning the lawsuit… all I did was this, so in hindsight I should’ve gone even bigger lol.",2021-07-09 00:54:00
ogfths,I just feel bad reading all the stories of you all being screwed over😵‍💫 *hugs for all*,2021-07-09 04:10:47

ogfths,This is absolutely 😈,2021-07-09 02:19:17
ogfths,May I see it. I kinda hope there’s bad in bed is shallow and petty and “sex isn’t rebuking it. People need to watch this and then pose it as a screen for when I have one lap left 🤣,2021-07-09 07:23:34

ogfths,"They fired me because I was a smart ass during the “Name the Band” game, after the singer insisted on a cringy, typical mid-00’s post-hardcore name which I don’t remember. Something like “After the Autumn Altar” or some stupid shit. 

They told me I wasn’t taking things seriously, so I took my $1,000 worth of cymbals and PA rig, and my $1,500 bass rig, and went home lol. Have fun playing band without my expensive ass gear, boys. 🤣",2021-07-09 01:48:07

ogfths,"He was basically a shitty 4-word band name generator with a lip ring.

The name I suggested that got me fired? Rod Holder and the Trouser Trout Orchestra 🤣",2021-07-09 02:55:00
ogfths,But then they'd own the domain and should be able to force a password reset and such. 😕,2021-07-09 01:27:17

142sgdn,Yeah… it’s my reading material when I’m trying to disassociate. I need it taken away 😂,2023-06-06 23:51:33
142sgdn,"Yeh, sure, y'all are ""leaving"" when you can't use a specific app... 🤣",2023-06-06 22:58:18
142sgdn,Ull just replace it with something equally wasteful 😅🤣😭,2023-06-07 05:45:04

Where am I going to look at cute kitties for hours on end? 😿",2023-06-07 01:01:34

142sgdn,Yeah I don't enjoy instagram or tik tok so my only way of avoid working is reddit. 😔,2023-06-07 11:17:02

142sgdn,"Its my porn machine 😞.  Without it I’ll have to go back to manually browsing 3 or more website’s manually searching for the best video to nut to. 

Im too lazy for that bs. This is terrible 😢",2023-06-07 04:21:02
142sgdn,"Wait, how is YT ""harder to break away from""? You can just pause a video, lol, and it maintains the watch-progress account wide, across devices. It should be basically the most convenient to break away from! 😂",2023-06-07 05:17:55
142sgdn,"This sounds like the right plan to me 🤔 

With all due respect, OP’s neckbeard Reddit addiction is concerning and all but I don’t think Reddit should “die” because of it 😂",2023-06-06 22:23:01

142sgdn,"Good riddance. I was a 10 year old girl when I discovered Reddit and that was one subreddit I stumbled upon. 

This site was a fucking cesspool; now it just barely passes basic decency for the wider consumer. Reddit was just diet 4chan for awhile. 

People have always repeated the same 3 jokes since this websites inception. I rather people get banned for calling someone a slur than allow /r/cutefemalecorpses to exist 🙄",2023-06-07 02:23:58
142sgdn,"No problem 😊.  Yes quit cold turkey 7 years ago. I was actually surprised how easy it was to quit you should give a try. 

Just be prepared to gain like 20lbs.",2023-06-07 16:26:20
