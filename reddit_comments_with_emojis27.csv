aonp75,"We haven't gone for a while (I AM nearly six months pregnant...) but my husband and I used to do this on dates all the time when we were dating. I think he liked that I enjoyed pretty dresses, but he also liked that they were more revealing than the jeans and t-shirts I would usually sport. 😄

It probably also was a plus that after one or two stores I got tired of it!",2019-02-09 15:55:15
aonp75,"My wife has banished me from shopping with her after a long series of horrible suggestions. The key is to suggest something ugly enough for her to say no, and not so ugly that she thinks you're doing it just to be annoying.

I’m comfortable with asking, but I think a lot of the time asking someone for something like that can just make you feel even more more isolated. I feel like I have to take care of everything and bear everything, and the on top of that arrange for people to show affection towards me? Support or help is one thing but stuff like affection or a sense of feeling wanted is not really something you can *ask* for in many situations. 

I don’t know how outward I am capable of being with my emotions (another problem) but in certain situations I really wish people would offer some sort of hand or some sort of recognition of what I’m going through.",2019-08-10 22:48:52

g4d0ij,I thought so too yeah… and then I started editing my own podcast. ☺️,2020-05-12 19:28:53
g4d0ij,"Yes of course. If you identify with your voice/body. (Voice is an expression of the body).

Here is the deal tho...

You’ve never heard how you sound because u hear it through your skull. 
Your body is doing the vibration while perceiving the vibration.
No chance that can happen without interference. 
It’s like the speaker is the microphone. 


Until you heard the recording....
But then you were biased and totally felt it sounds like s***.

This is quite normal I assure you. 

Others actually find your voice much more pleasant than you do yourself.

Don’t believe me, test it if you want. 

Lastly, those who matter, don’t mind. Those who mind, don’t matter.

Odds are, they are not aware of this phenomenon, as you now are. 
Opportunity to practice compassion, cause you bet they probably dislike their own voices. 
Unless total narcissists perhaps 😼",2020-05-13 20:44:06

7mhv6a,"It's ok, I'm more than happy to help. Anxiety can be pretty scary, especially when you don't know what's going on. I would highly suggest getting it checked out by a doctor if you haven't already.

Quick explaination of what OCD is; (this is all from memory, and I can only really speak for myself/parrot what I've read; I'd suggest doing your own research) OCD stands for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and is an anxiety disorder. Some people with it only have obsessions, some only have compulsions, and some have both. Obsessions can often manifest in phobias and intrusive thoughts and are characterized by an inablity to stop thinking about something, often accompanied by stress. Compulsions on the other hand are any action, often irrational, that a person feels they absolutely must perform. If these actions are not completed, the person feels intense anxiety. Often the compulsions are the only way the person knows of to get rid of the anxiety.

With that out of the way, I'll go ahead and answer your questions;

>Do you get intrusive thoughts imagining yourself doing unclean things?

No, I don't get intrusive thoughts about my phobias, but I do get intrusive thoughts about other things. My OCD kind of has (at least) two facets to it- the phobias I discussed above is one. The other is a bit more broad, mainly involving intrusive thoughts about sex and violence. I also recently realized I have some problems with social anxiety, and intrusive thoughts of 'they're judging me' and 'I said/did something horribly wrong' are fairly common.

>How do you deal?

At first, I didn't. Nobody in my life knew what was going on. Nobody knew how to deal with a panic attack. At first, I would just stand in on place desperately wishing I could somehow vanish from the 'unclean' world around me. My parents had to force me to eat, bathe, wake up- pretty much everything. Eventually, I was worn down (and put on meds). It came to a point where the consequences of not functioning were worse than the anxiety.

Slowly, it got better. Very slowly. At first, I couldn't touch any surface with my bare hands- eventually, I was able to touch surfaces I deemed 'not unclean', and my list of 'unclean' things shrunk as I slowly learned to calm my mind. Until about a year ago, I still couldn't eat food with my hands without wanting to throw up afterwards. Now, I'm perfectly capable of doing so- as long as my hands are clean.

I find ways to avoid making things that are clean unclean. I sleep in my day clothes, for example, because if I changed clothes I'd have to wash up and I've decided the stress isn't worth it. I've learned to flush toilets with my foot, and turn faucet handles with my elbows. It's become second nature to me at this point.

>How do other people in your life deal?

Again, at first, they didn't- especially my dad. My dad didn't understand what OCD was and thought I was merely acting out- this lead to everything actually becoming worse. He still gets mad on occasion if my compulsions are worse than normal, but he's learned that it's really best to let me work it out on my own and has become much more understanding.

Now, people are fairly understanding. My family has learned my quirks and to be honest, we don't even really think about it. When we set the table for dinner, my place is left empty because I like getting my own plate/bowl, and we try to avoid food with honey/beeswax. 

I manage to function within a semblance of normal nowadays. The thing that I think was hardest for my parents was realizing I have to get through this at my own pace. Pushing to hard lead to more anxiety, rather then less. 


Sorry for the lengthy post, it's a pretty complex subject. Again, I suggest doing some reading on it, but I'm glad I could help show you you're not alone ❤

Then what do you do with the penny?  Put it in a jar or buckets and wait until you get a lot of them.  When you get a bunch you haul them to the bank or the local coinstar to get real cash which takes even more time.  So basically the premise of your showerthought has been destroyed.

dswsum,"> Using money to accomplish basic tasks is childish and a waste.

Not really.

I’m Filipino and hiring “yayas” and/or “labanderas” is common here.

The way I see it, if you have disposable income and you can afford a helper, then that’s great. You’ll have more time for your family and for relaxation.

At the same time, someone who’s less fortunate than you but is industrious would need a livelihood — which is something that you, as someone with disposable income, would be able to provide.

It’s that simple.

Your internet opinion is noted, but I also wouldn’t expect random internet folks to understand it, especially if they don’t have a similar upbringing/culture/social structure/disposition.

I believe - (gotta double check as I’m a data science dude by profession, law-hack by passion) - that most group policy life insurance plans have suicide clauses. That is, plans where the master policyholder is an employer/organization/legal entity away and above your estate.

Yet imo, we should be able to die with dignity. Of course I believe this.. I am trying to jump out of an airplane when I’m about to go to the old people home.. but yes, seriously speaking, look into the suicide clauses in both living will construction and continually review your life insurance policies as they change to see how aligned you are.

I wholly suggest paying someone to review your estate plan. I bribed my best friend with a pack of Redhook IPA and a (begrudgingly) fulfilled promise to help him move. :) 

Good luck and good on you to think so proactively. 

It may be overreaching my position to say this, but don’t give up on your pa’s fight. Alzheimer’s can be mitigated to an extent. It takes so much to do so.. but keep hanging in there, keep bringing around old memories. Favorite songs of his. Favorite smells even. that’s what I used for my grandma’s passing and even when there were days she would lean over to my mum and ask, “who’s that nice man who keeps coming by to help?”, sometimes she would remember instantly when I’d bring her miso soup with extra fish cake or sing her her favorite hapa song. :)

d91xzy,"On a similar note, my grandpa is in his 80s and flirts with SO MANY WOMEN regardless of their age (he may as well have a bobble head that only turns left and right). No, this is not that “cute, sweet, old man” behavior. He’s been this way his entire life and married three times.  

He has a PhD in psychology and was a professor at OSU, after growing up dirt poor. Idk why but he thought that meant he was amazing. He got around with female students while married to my grandma and left her with 5 kids to raise alone. My family says he had a kid out of wedlock but I haven’t heard anything more about it. 

I’m still in contact with my Grammy, his second wife and a former student of his. She left him after his behavior didn’t change. 

Most recently he actually fell in love with the last woman. She died from Parkinson’s but he got his act together for her.  Two months after her death he went right back to flirting around and had two lady friends. I think they both decided to leave him behind and now he teeters between reminiscing and hating on them. 

Side note: both my grandpa and my recent ex are academics with egos which leads me to think academics think they’re above everyone else. 🤔

Suppose it is universal that old people who have been through a lot act rudely, then there doesn't exist a case where old people who have been through a lot *don't* act rudely.

If you can show a case where an old person has been through a lot and doesn't act rudely, you establish a contradiction

Thus, you prove that not all old people who have act rudely.  

Here we use a rule of inference: if a and b, then not a and not b (if one statement is true then so is its exact opposite)

If not all old people who have been through a lot act rudely

Then some old people who have been through a lot don't act rudely

**Man of Steel,
Woman of Kleenex
By Larry Niven**
>He's faster than a speeding bullet. He's more powerful than a locomotive. He's able to leap tall buildings at a single bound. Why can't he get a girl?

At the ripe old age of thirty-one (*Superman first appeared in Action Comics, June 1938*), Kal-El (alias Superman, alias Clark Kent) is still unmarried. Almost certainly he is still a virgin. This is a serious matter. The species itself is in danger!

An unwed Superman is a mobile Superman. Thus it has been alleged that those who chronicle the Man of Steel's adventures are responsible for his condition. But the cartoonists are not to blame.

Nor is Superman handicapped by psychological problems.

Granted that the poor oaf is not entirely sane. How could he be? He is an orphan, a refugee, and an alien. His homeland no longer exists in any form, save for gigatons upon gigatons of dangerous, prettily colored rocks.

As a child and young adult, Kal-El must have been hard put to find an adequate father-figure. What human could control his antisocial behavior? What human would dare try to punish him? His actual, highly social behavior during this period indicates an inhuman self-restraint.

What wonder if Superman drifted gradually into schizophrenia? Torn between his human and kryptonian identities, he chose to be both, keeping his split personalities rigidly separate. A psychotic desperation is evident in his defense of his ""secret identity.""

But Superman's sex problems are strictly physiological, and quite real.

The purpose of this article is to point out some medical drawbacks to being a kryptonian among human beings, and to suggest possible solutions. The kryptonian humanoid must not be allowed to go the way of the pterodactyl and the passenger pigeon.

I
What turns on a kryptonian?

Superman is an alien, an extraterrestrial. His humanoid frame is doubtless the result of parallel evolution, as the marsupials of Australia resemble their mammalian counterparts. A specific niche in the ecology calls for a certain shape, a certain size, certain capabilities, certain eating habits.

Be not deceived by appearances. Superman is no relative to homo sapiens.

What arouses Kal-El's mating urge? Did kryptonian women carry some subtle mating cue at appropriate times of the year? Whatever it is, Lois Lane probably didn't have it. We may speculate that she smells wrong, less like a kryptonian woman than like a terrestrial monkey. A mating between Superman and Lois Lane would feel like sodomy-and would be, of course, by church and common law.

II
Assume a mating between Superman and a human woman designated LL for convenience.

Either Superman has gone completely schizo and believes himself to be Clark Kent; or he knows what he's doing, but no longer gives a damn. Thirty-one years is a long time. For Superman it has been even longer. He has X-ray vision; he knows just what he's missing. (*One should not think of Superman as a Peeping Tom. A biological ability must be used. As a child Superman may never have known that things had surfaces, until he learned to suppress his X-ray vision. If millions of people tend shamelessly to wear clothing with no lead in the weave, that is hardly Superman's fault.*)

The problem is this. Electroencephalograms taken of men and women during sexual intercourse show that orgasm resembles ""a kind of pleasurable epileptic attack."" One loses control over one's muscles.

Superman has been known to leave his fingerprints in steel and in hardened concrete, accidentally. What would he do to the woman in his arms during what amounts to an epileptic fit?

III
Consider the driving urge between a man and a woman, the monomaniacal urge to achieve greater and greater penetration. Remember also that we are dealing with kryptonian muscles.

Superman would literally crush LL's body in his arms, while simultaneously ripping her open from crotch to sternum, gutting her like a trout.

IV
Lastly, he'd blow off the top of her head.

Ejaculation of semen is entirely involuntary in the human male, and in all other forms of terrestrial life. It would be unreasonable to assume otherwise for a kryptonian. But with kryptonian muscles behind it, Kal-El's semen would emerge with the muzzle velocity of a machine gun bullet. (*One can imagine that the Kent home in Smallville was riddled with holes during Superboy's puberty. And why did Lana Lang never notice that?*)

In view of the foregoing, normal sex is impossible between LL and Superman.

Artificial insemination may give us better results.

V
First we must collect the semen. The globules will emerge at transonic speeds. Superman must first ejaculate, then fly frantically after the stuff to catch it in a test tube. We assume that he is on the Moon, both for privacy and to prevent the semen from exploding into vapor on hitting the air at such speeds.

He can catch the semen, of course, before it evaporates in vacuum. He's faster than a speeding bullet.

But can he keep it?

All known forms of kryptonian life have superpowers. The same must hold true of living kryptonian sperm. We may reasonably assume that kryptonian sperm are vulnerable only to starvation and to green kryptonite; that they can travel with equal ease through water, air, vacuum, glass, brick, boiling steel, solid steel, liquid helium, or the core of a star; and that they are capable of translight velocities.

What kind of a test tube will hold such beasties?

Kryptonian sperm and their unusual powers will give us further trouble. For the moment we will assume (because we must) that they tend to stay in the seminal fluid, which tends to stay in a simple glass tube. Thus Superman and LL can perform artificial insemination.

At least there will be another generation of kryptonians.

Or will there?

VI
A ripened but unfertilized egg leaves LL's ovary, begins its voyage down her Fallopian tube.

Some time later, tens of millions of sperm, released from a test tube, begin their own voyage up LL's Fallopian tube.

The magic moment approaches...

Can human breed with kryptonian? Do we even use the same genetic code? On the face of it, LL could more easily breed with an ear of corn than with Kal-El. But coincidence does happen. If the genes match...

One sperm arrives before the others. It penetrates the egg, forms a lump on it's surface, the cell wall now thickens to prevent other sperm From entering. Within the now-fertilized egg, changes take place...

And ten million kryptonian sperm arrive slightly late.

Were they human sperm, they would be out of luck. But these tiny blind things are more powerful than a locomotive. A thickened cell wall won't stop them. They will *all* enter the egg, obliterating it entirely in an orgy of microscopic gang rape. So much for artificial insemination.

But LL's problems are just beginning.

VII
Within her body there are still tens of millions of frustrated kryptonian sperm. The single egg is now too diffuse to be a target. The sperm scatter.

They scatter without regard to what is in their path. They leave curved channels, microscopically small. Presently all will have found their way to the open air.

That leaves LL with several million microscopic perforations all leading deep into her abdomen. Most of the channels will intersect one or more loops of intestine.

Peritonitis is inevitable. LL becomes desperately ill.

Meanwhile, tens of millions of sperm swarm in the air over Metropolis.

VIII
This is more serious than it looks.

Consider: these sperm are virtually indestructible. Within days or weeks they will die for lack of nourishment. Meanwhile they cannot be affected by heat, cold, vacuum, toxins, or anything short of green kryptonite. (*And other forms of kryptonite. For instance, there are chunks of red kryptonite that make giants of kryptonians. Imagine ten million earthworm size spermatozoa swarming over a Metropolis beach, diving to fertilize the beach balls... but I digress.*) There they are, minuscule but dangerous; for each has supernormal powers.

Metropolis is shaken by tiny sonic booms. Wormholes, charred by meteoric heat, sprout magically in all kinds of things: plate glass, masonry, antique ceramics, electric mixers, wood, household pets, and citizens. Some of the sperm will crack lightspeed. The Metropolis night comes alive with a network of narrow, eerie blue lines of Cherenkov radiation.

And women whom Superman has never met find themselves in a delicate condition.

Consider: LL won't get pregnant because there were too many of the blind mindless beasts. But whenever one sperm approaches an unfertilized human egg in its panic flight, it will attack.

How close is close enough? A few centimeters? Are sperm attracted by chemical cues? It seems likely. Metropolis had a population of millions; and kryptonian sperm could travel a long and crooked path, billions of miles, before it gives up and dies.

Several thousand blessed events seem not unlikely. (*If the pubescent Superboy plays with himself, we have the same problem over Smallville.*)

Several thousand lawsuits would follow. Not that Superman can't afford to pay. There's a trick where you squeeze a lump of coal into its allotropic diamond form...

They told me I didn't know what I was talking about.

I want grandkids.” (He was in his early 20s 🙄, but we eventually broke up when he started seeing a girl a bit older than him that already had a kid. He moved her in before I was able to move out. My dad told me he realized while we were moving my things out of *now* his apartment, that his parents supported him cheating on me and throwing me away because they got a grandchild finally.  
  
They had their own baby within a few months of me moving out (so I think he had been cheating for a lot longer than I knew of), and now, 11+ years later, they are still together. I was very sad when he threw me out, and I was 19, so I handled the situation about as well as any other 19 years old, but within less than 3 months, I sort of realized that he might have been a shitty bf, I never thought he was a bad person, and I do believe he probably struggled a lot when he met her, knowing she was probably who he was meant to be with...but he lived with a gf.

I head towards the woods and there's a massive wood pile, I have my Nike slides on and think fuck it, climb up it and jump down the other side. All of a sudden I hear, ""Hey get back here!"". I'm thinking to myself he doesn't see me, I keep walking through the woods and his flashlight pins me where I stand, I hide behind a tree and he yells ""Get the fuck back over here, I see you"". At this point the adrenaline kicks in along with some liquid courage and I'm thinking no shot he's following me in here and I take off my slides and run as fast as I can through the woods, couple of cuts on my feet but it was worth it, didn't get called down to the principal's that Monday. 😁",2019-02-14 04:58:23

aq9iut,"Kids at my school parties did that. I always figured there were so many slow kids that I could easily outrun as many of them as there were cops. Also, most cops couldn't catch the faster kids anyway; they gunned for the fatties, girls in heels or skirts, the drunkest/wobbliest, etc. As long as you were one of those, you're good.

aq9iut,"It's not a tremendous story, but when I was 16 me and my friends once went to a playground in a local park at midnight and decided to get high and naked. We played on the swings and slides nude until we saw cops cars coming and scattered to different hiding places. Me and my fwb dove into a muddy ditch naked to duck under the flashlight. Only one person was noticed at all, but he still managed to evade them and we all made it out safe. 🙌",2019-02-13 20:41:16

aq9iut,Cops obviously aren’t stopping gang violence with their current tactics so maybe it is time to rethink our strategy on combating gang crime. But I suppose you can just be facetious and assume I have no nuance to my argument 🤷‍♂️ ,2019-02-14 13:34:41

I'd done it for GCSE and actively tried to keep up learning after leaving school but didn't have a lot of practise speaking so I knew I wasn't great and had an accent, but said ""oui, pas beaucoup mais je pense que c'est assez/yes, not a lot but I think it's enough."" She gave me this sneer and went ""so you DON'T speak French then"" in a really condescending voice.

a1zjj2,"Thanks for explaining it in depth! I'm not a native English speaker and in my country we learn British English, so I find these discussions really engaging.

In Spanish, my first language, such a construction is grammatically correct too. But the phrasing of the original sentence you gave would sound weird no matter the word order. Even in English, you took away the copulative subordinate (""to be true"") for your latter example and used an adverb instead, which is a bigger change than just word order. I took it away too when translating it to Spanish on my previous post and I believe it makes the sentence sound much more natural in English too.

Also, I think ""to find truth"" sounds a bit theatrical in Spanish, so I'm probably bound to find it awkward. 😅",2018-12-02 09:26:28

They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best
If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing
For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow
Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show

9mbcux,"Fellow fat guy here so i feel your pain fellow redditor. It's not like we can just get up one morning and decide ""todays the day im gonna start losing weight"" and then exercise and change our eating habits immediately. But its not impossible, i think we need to mentally prepare ourselves, and take one small step at a time. People dont understand that eating habits are programmed into your brain, for instance i usually have a midnight snack, and if i dont eat that then i actually get hungry and it feels like i need to eat it or else i'll die, but i know (in the part of my brain i dont wanna listen to) i dont need it to survive. I've been thinkin i need to lose weight, so for me i think the first step is cutting the midnight snack, which will not be an easy task. I would like to thank you for sharing your struggle and although i know no words of encouragement from a stranger on the internet will change your mind/life i just want to tell you i think its mind over matter. If you think this is something that you can NEVER change then you wont even think of trying, but if you dont look at the overall picture and find one thing (something you eat, standing for intermittent periods of time while watching tv) to use as a starting point i think you can start to gradually change your mind if not your life.

9mbcux,"The worst part for me is that they disguise this as a body positivity movement when in reality it’s a way to delude themselves from not seeing a health issue and not work on it. It bugs me when they indoctrinate young girls who could do something about it sooner. So many of those women turned on Lena Dunham because she started working out and losing weight, which she needed to do for urgent health reasons. She had to explain her fans that she wasn’t abandoning “real” women and going all Hollywood, but that her body seriously needed exercise and better food. She even had to ask her trainer to help her *not* lose weight to not alienate her fans, and her trainer was like “you’re actually losing weight because you’re not sedentary anymore. We can’t change that. This is good for you.” She felt guilty because fans bullied her on social media for losing weight. I’ve seen those women claim on social media that fitness and exercise are not body positive and that working out and promoting an active life style is fat shaming 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️",2018-10-08 05:55:43

I don’t deny myself anything because that’s going to be easier to binge on later, just try to have a taste if possible. Move as much as I can. I love swimming and found that a hospital near me has a pool and a gym so it’s filled with people in my situation, elderly, and it’s not a family or public pool so I don’t feel judged and the anxiety of being ridiculed goes down. I work with my doctor. And I have a support group I go to. Know that you’re not dieting, no diet scheme is sustainable. You’re learning to eat. 

One pitfall I had is when I fail and I think well, I blew it. And then fall back on my old habits. Someone told me once “If you’re making an omelette and you drop an egg on the floor, what do you do?” I answered, “I clean it up and grab another egg.” she said, “Exactly. You don’t throw away the entire carton. So why do we do that when we mess up on our eating?”. Don’t throw away your carton. You got this. 😊",2018-10-08 08:01:31

Its subtext is ""ok whatever 🙄"" in that case. or, in the context of the joke, really similar to the emoticon -.-

If it's just casual conversation, k is usually a lot less passive aggressive. like, if my mom says ""could you pick up eggs at the store when you go"" and I respond ""k"" there are no hard feelings at all.",2018-11-30 16:16:15

ly9rez,"They're still way better than most years after that though. The pinnacle year was 25 for me in terms of overall enjoyment of life. I felt indestructible and confident and it seemed like a never ending party. A decade later things were turning more boring and predictable as responsibilities and settling down replaced the wilder times. Two decades later and partying feels like ancient history, life seems to be mostly pain with a dash of fun every once in a while. Make hay while the sun shines boys and girls 🤠",2021-03-05 22:40:46

ly9rez,"Just remember, without death there is no life! If you're scared of death, without it, you wouldn't even be alive! 

We're all just collections of meat and flesh that happened to evolve enough to exist in this state, but when it's done we go back into the earth whence we came. Hope that helps

Edit: for me it helps put things into perspective, that I fear death so much but I would not experience life were it not for the guarantee of death. The experiences, the memories, the sorrow, none of it would exist if we it weren't this way. I'm sorry if I made it worse for you 😅

I guess suicidal people go through this, they never made the decision to be born, so death is an easy solution. But for those that value life, it is an interesting thing for sure",2021-03-05 16:16:37

tq9o1b,"Truthfully I was rooting for him to win the Oscar before. I think I actually forgot his shenanigans his joke of a relationship with his wife, kids and social media memes in general and focused on his acting. But goddamn my view of him has become more negative. The way he lashed out at a public ceremony like a deranged person was extremely out of line. Honestly made me forget about his Oscar because his behaviour was completely uncalled for. Should’ve saved that punch for his wife’s boyfriends. What gets me is that people actually gave him a standing ovation? No respect for any of these celebs, except John Leguizamo. I like Chris Rock even more now and his awesome way of handling the situation! Kudos to him 👏🏼",2022-03-29 13:05:41
tq9o1b,So I made a comment about Chris rock cheating on his wife when she was pregnant I Wana correct this information I mistakenly was thinking of Kevin Heart. he's the one who cheated on his pregnant wife why he's in all the b rated commercials no one wants his little ass. Any way I apologize for my mis information and to #ChrisRock even though he deserved it 💯. He's still funny as hell and he played it well.,2022-03-29 13:32:32

That being said, yeah, this was insane—Especially coming from already super rich, super famous, super good looking people. I mean, the point of GI Jane is that she was a really hot woman sporting the tough, shaved head, badass look. It’s not really even that shocking of a joke. This is the pinnacle of being antagonized for some celebrities and it shows they really see themselves as royalty. At least Will Smith refrained from challenging Chris Rock to a duel. 🙄 And I don’t really watch this kind of shit either, but exactly—- comedians at awards shows like these are known for being the ONE TIME some of these super elite celebrities ever get poked and prodded even slightly.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp on the English language most of the jokes will go over a typical reader’s head. There’s also his nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his comments- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike u/Durandal71 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in his existential catchphrase ""Edit: Grammer"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

hgimdu,"I really noticed people started hating on any communication, that was not using traditional words, happening just over two decades ago when people in chat rooms started using text based emoticons and using acronyms like lol...I remember some heated, on the other part, discussions over why it mattered. In chat rooms people needed to expresse things quickly because of how fast the chats were going and emoticons and acronyms were the natural bridge; hieroglyphswere effective for a reason. Most of us at the time grew up with pen pals on the other side of the world, that we hand wrote letters to. Then in the late 90's early 2ks we were having to evolve to an exponentially faster version of text communication. So emoticons and emojis worked great and still do, when used in moderation.

a77a8o,"I’m a foodie YouTuber so I post tons of pictures to reddit food forums. I looooove sharing/learning info from around the world 🤓 

At first, I used a secret reddit account so I could share food pictures anonymously because there are people that don’t know us, have never met us, nor do they know us personally, but hate us because our YouTube videos just aren’t their thing. That makes it hard to share things and to have a conversation without people pre-judging your posts.

And I get it! Not everyone’s personality is going to appeal to everyone. I’m not hurt about it, but the reason I’m sharing this is bc one Reddit user commented in a very friendly way on some of our food pictures and was excited about what I was sharing, not knowing my identity.

ax5gem,"I've always found this analogy interesting!
I remember listening to Infinite Monkey Cage and then rambling about brain in terms of electronic devices. So
Brain would be parallel to the hardware (the physical collection of neurons and connectivity) and mind is something that runs on it, parallel to a set of applications running on the hardware (sorry, I'm over simplifying it for my own sake). So some of the functions in the mind are defined at birth while some are created/defined according to the society/context/experience (for eg. a function of the mind is morality, but the definition of morality itself is defined according to the society). 
Now some of these apps defined in the mind becomes a part of conscious self, some become the subconscious mind (forget having root previleges to access these, our conscious mind does not even know what processes are running). These interact with each other and with the system (body). 
Further, a part of these conscious applications continuously create an illusion of ""self"", and narrate a story around this ""self"". This story of self is the basis for our social lives and somehow that helps us survive?! 

Okay i was going somewhere with this but the process crashed 😅",2019-03-04 17:04:57

""My eyes, my books, my body""... We treat them in a class of possessions unfortunately, perhaps through linguistic confusion over the years we have lost touch of reality. 

In truth it seems to me that I AM my body.  I am not some mystical point of magical self that floats behind the scenes of material reality, simply ""owning"" or ""having"" a body.  

I do not have a body, nor any organs, I am this body.

ax5gem,"I think that we as a species are a conscious part of the universe. We are always working/shaped in relation to the dynamics and space of our immediate surroundings (which we know we cannot control in the immediate moment). Which to me (and other people) implies that we are a part of the same organism, not the ‘human’ organism but rather the ‘everything’ organism.

We are merely the self inflecting, mouth-noise creating, spaceship building monkeys that were put forward by intelligent planetary evolution to manipulate matter (build spaceships, create colonies, become mole people underground while the earth dies, save the earth, become moon men, continue life in a computer simulation - who knows). 

I think We each are (maybe) observing a different perspective of this happening. 

Not looking for arguments just spewing all this as it’s been on my mind a lot lately. I’m certain my model will change as I seek understanding.

I also think ‘fungus’ are aliens that spawned life on this rock, I think mushroom intelligence is like our grandfather/mother and I also think that crumbed fish is very tasty 😝 I also think this won’t compute with plenty of

And students tried the same thing with my prof every semester. She purposely structured the assignments so it was challenging to get all of the questions fully answered within the page limit. After grading she would cover what an A, B and C paper looked like and covered her grading rubric. Students still complained. What they got was specific constructive criticism of their writing from from a chic version of professor McGonagall. The Art History lounge was just over from her office and I always enjoyed hearing the bits and pieces of those conversations.

xuc9gh,"I've got a great example! From today even. I work in a restaurant with a lot of call in orders.

Me: answers phone

Customer: hi this is (name), I'd like to order (food)

Me: OK that'll be twenty minutes

Customer l: don't you need my name?

Me: you did already give that to me, thanks though

*twenty minutes later, customer walks in*

Me: hi what name was it under?

Customer: oh I didn't give a name, they didn't ask for one

🤔",2022-10-03 21:56:57
xuc9gh,"I worked in the two worst sectors of retail: IT and Customer Service at the same time. I’ll give you a hint where I worked. 🍎 I didn’t sell anything, I fixed everything.

Anyway, you have not dealt with people in retail until you have to help somebody with their personal information, their technology, and still have the patience of a saint even though they don’t know their iCloud password (or better, they’re still using their Netscape email they made back in 1994) (for those wondering, it runs through Yahoo now.)

The amount of mental and emotional gymnastics you experience in 1 day is mind melting. An example of a typical day:

Customer 1.) Customer states that the screen broke even though they dropped it on carpet 3 inches above the floor. Bruh, the screen looks like a semi rolled over it and then was used as an axe throwing target… wtf do you want me to say? No, you’re dumb for even trying to justify what happen, because it’s not true. It’s $150+ for a new screen. Sorry. 🤡 

Customer 2.) My computer won’t get past the logo and won’t boot. Customer is angry for waiting 3 hours for help, and drove an hour and a half to get to the store. Performed an NVRAM reset, done. A simple Google Search would have told you to try that, as it’s a key combination upon start up. Do I expect them to know that? Absolutely not, but use your phone and look it up, or call the support line, as they would have had you try it, avoiding this whole cloud of frustration and anger you brought into the store. 🌧️ 

Customer 3.) My mother passed away and I need to transfer her photos from her computer to my hard drive.
Me being empathetic, I am super polite, professional,  and considerate, until they say they have almost a Terabyte of Photos to transfer and don’t understand why I can’t do it for them for free. This drive is using USB 3, on a HDD. This will take hours!!
I state, we can offer a data transfer for $99. It will be done by tomorrow morning! 🙂
You’re going to charge me? I just experienced a death in the family!😡
Short answer: yes 🙃

Now do this 30+ more times. Congrats, you’re done with day 1. By the way, these 3 sessions were all at the SAME TIME!! I used to take 5 appointments at a time because I could/had to otherwise we would be so far behind, we would never catch up. When your employees call off due to sheer lack of motivation as everyday cripples you personally and mentally, the workflow is the problem.

The experience I gained about the psychology of a person and how to talk to people, along with the technical troubleshooting was a gift that has blessed me in my life afterward, but the absolute astonishment I felt after involving myself with peoples lives through technology was horrible. I found that the dumbest people, are usually the rudest ones.

TL,DR: Retail is hard, so be nice to retail employees, as most are truly working as hard as they can with the tools they’ve been given. Thanks.",2022-10-04 06:12:41

They thought it would be nice if their parents had an extra surprise gift. That's where I was to come in. After that, there was very little info given to go on. Basically his parents are pretty sedentary people, not foodies, and like to be on their phones a lot. Anyway, I did my best. Not what I was expecting, but I tried to be a good sport. At a local Winter Christmas Market I got them a handcrafted cribbage board with a little Minnesota cut out in the middle (they are from New York) and a handmade Holiday Greetings from Minnesota card. I added a deck of cards and a lovely hot cocoa & snacks gift basket to the box and shipped it off. I spent extra so they would get it before their gift exchange on the 20th. I thought I did a good job... all I got in response was ""Hi. I received the gift. Thanks."" I was so bummed! Did they like it? Were they surprised? Picture of parents opening gift?

fqi66h,"Me too man,i have a really bad body consciousness starting from high school.At that time,i always felt like i have a big bottom and pear like shape and i diet rigorously until im in a good shape but during that time,to me,i still look fat. I always avoid crowd like in cafeteria in my school or school assembly because i always felt like someone might be laughing at me because of something that is totally not true at all

1.My pear shape body
2.Round fluffy face
3.Ugly hair

So after high school i start dieting more and started working out hoping that i fix all the nonexistent issues above. Now in college,im sure i got a really muscular and athletic body,ok face with common hairstyle.All my friends and family insist that i look just like everyone else but deep in my im still insecure af and those 3 problems above still looms around me and im still avoiding crowded place and always being insecure about myself.I dont know why but your comment just made me want to tell everyone this problem that i have. I always check out all my friends and always said "" i wish i have hair like that or chiseled face like that or other stuff"" but im sure to everyone else i look just fine and normal. Its just myself that still cant get over this thing 😞 

Edit : i still can function normally in term of social but its just this feeling in myself that keep bothering me",2020-03-28 14:25:49
fqi66h,"to be honest I was tested when I was 12 years old, and I'm sure the test for an adult would be significantly different, because then it was just general social skills observation and they gave me books to read out loud and identify certain things in the book and asked me to describe the social interactions that were going on in the books. I read my diagnosis, and I definitely had issues keeping personal space with the doctor even 😆",2020-03-28 14:42:34
fqi66h,"Absolutely, but it only goes so far, I only started working out when I was 18 years old and I'm 23 now, before I would be insecure to take my shirt off at the pool, I would never let people touch me if I was romantically involved with them (which was rare), and I constantly felt lethargic, and weak,  and despised my body

So while I will definitely say that my body image has improved, and that I do feel a bit more confident in that respect, and I definitely feel a lot more healthy than I did before, it certainly hasn't helped me be more social, I still have a hard time making conversation if it's not about a specific topic that I already know a lot about. 😆",2020-03-28 14:47:51

jwslt1,"It can DEFINITELY make you anxious/paranoid. I once got convinced of some crazy ass shit that once I sobered up, I couldn’t believe I came up with that lmao. But if I play a video game or work on writing my novel I can feel like I’m actually in that world. Especially with Vr. So I either watch like an anime (something funny or filled with action, like one punch man) or I play a game like destiny where I have to focus so hard I forget about being paranoid/anxious. But it’s definitely a thing if you aren’t calm and comfortable with the feeling of Thc. Or slowly build up a tolerance. The only time I suffer from anxiety is from edibles. But I’m really laid back by nature so I can convince myself “aye bro, you’re just high rn, you’re chillin” and lock on to whatever I’m doing. I recommend no mans sky with VR. Or Skyrim VR with mods.

I also experience what I think is called time stuttering / skipping? The absolute worst. So at the drive through... I look across through to the other side at the other drive thru window.

jwslt1,"Sorry to hear. Different strains affect me differently as does the mood/activity. What it does sound like is that you may be getting **too** high and that's unpleasant for me as well.

If you want to give it another go, I suggest a bud vaporizer if your friend has one. Vaping bud is cleaner and has a more measured dose while be fairly mild in that very little bud is needed to be effective. The first draw heats up the bud and vaporizes the terpenes-this will be the most flavourful hit and you may not see any vapor on exhale. The second hit should bring the THC to a boiling point and you should see some vapor on exhale. Depending on the vaporizer and how well you hit it (was it a good size cloud or wispy), you can either stop now or take one more hit. Then just chill for the next 15min to see how high those hits carried you. Find that sweet spot that is comfortable to you. If after that time it didn't do much, take another hit and wait 15min again.

Taking this approach you may find the level where you will enjoy the high and I do hope you find it. You can check out /r/Vaporents for vape info or I would be happy to help you with selecting one if you decide-hopefully your friends already has a decent one to try out.

jwslt1,"oh my god, i was scrolling and scrolling waiting to see if i could find someone who had a similar experience i had once. admittedly i smoked with someone i wasnt comfortable with and who smokes extremely strong weed, but i’m prone to weed panic attacks no matter what. it was just my worst one ever. 

it was sort of like that, like i could see myself panicking in the front seat of this ford focus in 3rd person immediately as i knew it was coming on. then i felt like i was in a time loop, and my brain would not stop thinking the same fucking three things over and over and over again. simultaneously, somehow, i’m thinking i’m about to die, or that i was somehow already dead. then that i was going to be stuck like that forever. then i had this weird thought, “if i remember this one specific event/memory that i can only recall right now, i’ll die at that moment”. does that even make sense? i was so consumed with the idea of dying. 


time was lagging so horribly, i thought i was never going to come down. legit cried for like, two and a half hours pulled over in some parking lot in my friends car. embarrassed the hell out of myself but oh well. learned my lesson and got some trauma to boot. 💁🏻‍♀️",2020-11-19 07:36:56

In the first series of episodes there is a clear character progression, with recurring tropes and themes in future episodes.

The last episode ends with Tom and Jerry seemingly committing suicide while sitting on a set of train tracks. It was meant to be an end, which gives the show closure. If it was as two dimensional as you suggest, the writers would not have done this. As a writer myself this is clear as day.

I have been enjoying it. Smoking a bit too much weed, though. I might venture out soon as it has been a while... I think it’s probably healthy to get a balance; I have always been introverted though, but it has gotten worse in the last year or two. I also work from home, so if I don’t go out, I spend my whole week inside my flat. It has been like that for a little too long. I don’t really wonder about missing out anymore - I have stopped caring; so what if I spend my life stoned playing games 🤔",2018-09-01 04:59:43

9bzh5g,"Haaa , so true. 
Thinking back, I would be so miserable, if circumstances found me In front of the box, on a Friday or Saturday night. To make it more depressing is that, we only had 3 channels; CH2 - Good clarity 
CH6- was the one, that screened a Friday and Saturday night movie-Fluctuated between good and shit. ( shit when something good was on & good when something shit was on) 
CH3- Always shit. 25% at best. 
And I cannot tell you, how many times I watched - The Sound Of Music! - Casablanca- Gone with Wind and Gold Finger. 😑
CH6- had a movie library that I  could of neatly stacked in my sock draw. 
Sometimes, they played the same movie over consecutive weekends!- true. Mind 🤔Bending,, would be a gross understatement. 
Movie about to begin—-
TV— “So folks, something for the...... 
ME— no don’t say whole family to sing......
TV—the whole family to sing along to
ME— what, Oh My GOD!!, This is BULLSHIT!!!—- 
TV— -with Julie and the kids , arrrrre you Guessed it: A do- a deer  - a female deer.......”🤬
Those nights in , turning the Teli Knob from fuzz, to a bit fuzzy , to a re-peat, back to a bit fuzzy , then back to just, fuzzy, then back....., and so on
Man, just thinking about it makes me depressed 😑. Never mind...
For that reason , I never owned a TV , until I was a bit over 30.😌.  Then years later——- Netflix. — 💚 I’m not ashamed to say- about 4 months ago - I watched 8 episodes of ‘Godless,’.  in a row.  
And I would of watched 15 if I didn’t have to go to work. 
Yep- back on the couch.

Person 1 (P1): 1 ticket, Probability: 1/300M 
Person 2 (P2): 1 ticket, Probability: 1/300M

Probability that you and person 1 win:
(Your probability)(P1) = 1/300M.

Probability that all three win:
(Your probability)(P1)(P2) = 1/300M^2 

Probability that N wins:

j7wxms,"I was part of an online fandom community one time. One person had an unpopular opinion of the show and to be honest, her personality was kind of a devils advocate type so she had these opinions on occasion. Honestly I appreciate people like this because otherwise you're in some weird hive mind or echo chamber. Anyway, someone found her personal photos and decided to post and bully her appearance. To my disappointment about a good ten others joined in as well. I can't stand bullying as I was bullied as s kid and I vowed to always speak loudly against it. I basically called out each individual and told them they're pathetic for getting so upset over a cartoon of all things and get mental help if it affected them so much. 

A week later, I got a personal email from a girl saying she was the one they bullied. I have no idea how she found me, none of my information was linked to my account, she must of spent a good chunk of time trying to find me. She told me how much it meant that someone stood up for her and she spent that day in tears. She said she was bullied irl and when it happened online she was so dejected. She told me she would always remember what I did. 

Always remember there's a human being you're talking to on the other side of the screen. You have no idea how their life is like or mental state when they posted something. 🙂 Context is everything.",2020-10-09 17:59:27

Well after a few minutes, I asked how much it cost and she said $9 something. So I gave the cashier my 10 dollar bill. Both the woman, kids, and cashier were awe struck. They both kept asking “are you sure?!” and it was obvious this woman had no other way of paying so of course, and it was $10.

Like showering with underwear on in gym class, refusing the national anthem, grew his hair into a long rat tail, you get the picture.
Kids would stuff him into the podium used for speeches, and the push that up against the wall, and surround it with chairs. Being the only black kid in school, I knew no one would risk picking on me, while I defended him or got him out of the podium.

After 17 years of not seeing him, I found him online. I messaged him just say hello, and it turns out, he doesn't remember me in the slightest bit, like AT ALL. 🤷🏾‍♂️",2020-10-09 18:05:55

She took me to lunch in public the day I landed and I told her everything over lunch and cried the whole time. 

My SIL was very cold and distant towards me. 

A woman at another table heard me tell my story. She left the same time we did and stopped me in the parking lot. 

She gave me a shiny flat orange colored stone that said, “Peace” on it. I thanked her and tried to get to the car as quickly as I could. 

I was embarrassed that someone saw me in the emotional state that I was in. 

After I got back to my SIL’s I looked at that stone and realized she saw me more then the person I was talking to at lunch. 

I still have that stone. I took it to court with me while divorcing my husband and held and rubbed it while I was stressed. 

I don’t know the person that gave it to me but it really helped me through an extremely difficult time. I am forever grateful for their kindness. It was an angel moment for me. ❤️",2020-10-09 23:29:46

>You were avoiding potential confrontation by spending money.

Confrontation with who? You think I felt like I needed to avoid confrontation with a Buddhist monk? 🤭

>You were doing it to impress your girlfriend.

Ah yes, I wanted to impress my girlfriend when she spent her money on something that was her idea.

>You’re a narcissist and made use of an opportunity to demonstrate that you are a “good person“.

Yes, narcissists do things that no one else cares about/sees and then never talk about what they did. Classic behavior.

>That last one sounds pretty likely if the earliest example you think of for empathy is from several years ago.

Sounds like a massive assumption on your part. If you wanted recent behavior you probably should have asked. 

You just seemed bitter and reactionary, so I went with something that I thought might force you to twist yourself into a braindead knot trying to explain, like saying ""you were narcissistic when you did this thing largely unnoticed or were trying to impress your girlfriend when she took initiative to buy a ticket, just so you could avoid confrontation with a devout Buddhist.""

""My heart is broken. You will never meet a woman as sweet, generous, talented & luminescent as #RussiTaylor. I first met her when we did #PigglyWinks together. She would sit beside me and let me wear all her fancy rings. Then she would point through the glass to her husband Wayne.Who would watch her with mutual adoration and in the sweetest little mini mouse voice she would say to me “isn’t he handsome?!”

When Wayne passed she was devastated. She was inconsolable. She didn’t want to see anyone. I threatened to come over to her house after two weeks of refusing to answer the phone. I said “Russi if you don’t answer this call I’m on my way over.” She picked up the phone and cried and said, “My hand hurts from not being able to hold his“ 🥺

I’ve never seen a love like theirs. It was so pure, OF COURSE they were #MickeyandMinnieYou could feel their love in all they did. Everyone loved them. She was a legend. The only consolation I can think of is now the two lovebirds...or #lovemice are together again.Love you #Russi. I will miss you until we meet again in the recording studio in the sky.""",2022-05-05 21:53:54

f70ybb,"Scary Terry coming for you 😱

I've had exactly one dream that was 3 levels deep, luckily it wasn't a nightmare. Unfortunately I seem to go through a cycle where every so often I have nightmares that are impossible to wake up from. I wouldn't go so far as to call them night terrors, but the threshold that is normally enough for me to wake up stops working. To boot, the dreams are more vivid and feel more real than my usual dreams.",2020-02-21 02:33:37

7mu9zn,"I was donor conceived!! My mom told me when I was 15 (17 years ago now). My brother and I had come from different donors, and so were only half brothers, which explained why every teacher always said we look and act nothing alike. He ended up taking his own life later that same year making it the hardest, loneliest, and most confusing year of my life 😢

Years later, I ended up getting a job as a genetics technologist, and only this year decided to take the DNA test from Ancestry.ca to see if I had any relatives out there. I also wanted to know what my genetic ancestry was though.

The day my results came in, I had decided to wait and look at them with my girlfriend. But within an hour I had received a message from a girl who showed up as a half sibling! I cried the ugliest happy tears I ever have. After 17 years of knowing there had to be more out there I finally found one. And it turns out she had only received her results a day earlier!

But it doesn’t end there. She told me she also previously did 23andme, and had already met two other girls! I went from having a brother, losing him, and then years later gaining 3 sisters! We just all got together for Christmas last night!

Their stories are sooo different too. All of them just found out in the last year that they were donor conceived. All over the age of 35. And all because they decided to take 23andme on a whim. They’re all at least 4 years older than me too, so god only knows how many others were conceived by the same guy in between us, or after me. I’m hoping more will show up in the new year with all these people getting the tests for Christmas!!

TL;DR I was donor conceived and knew for years. Only just took an ancestry test this past year. Found 3 half siblings who came from the same donor",2017-12-29 21:13:27
7mu9zn,What if the purpose of this thead is to promote ancestry 🤔,2017-12-29 17:40:30
7mu9zn,Wonder why everyone got a DNA test kit for Christmas but me 🤔,2017-12-29 22:56:33

Edit: Source is Rowland Miller's textbook on 'Intimate Relationships', and the uni course I just completed.",2017-12-29 15:04:05
7mu9zn,Can confirm. Found out 2 weeks ago my sister is actually my half sister ☹️ We are not going to tell my dad.,2017-12-30 02:46:40
7mu9zn,What about men whose children belong to the wrong woman 🤔,2017-12-29 20:48:23
7mu9zn,"TBH, I was always worried that my father might be the dude my mother ran away with when I was a baby, because I don’t look like my dad... But he was telling me all about these DNA tests and how we should all get one for the fun of it. I guess him being so confident still doesn’t mean much 😅 OTOH I have a lot in common, medically and otherwise, with my paternal grandmother, and I just look so much like my bio mom that there’s no room left to look like anyone else... On top of that, my dad is in atrocious physical condition due to an accident many years ago, and it’s safe to say his face looks completely different than it did prior, so maybe I would look like him if he were a normal weight/didn’t have so many broken bones...

 You can tell I think this through often, haha.",2017-12-29 17:36:35

7mu9zn,There are way too many white women who claim my great grandma was an Indian Princess. 😅,2017-12-29 15:59:18
7mu9zn,"Ikr it bums me out how even the faithful people sometimes say things like “I know temptation is everywhere, but marriage is sacred!”. Umm, not once, like literally not even once, have I *wanted* to cheat on my husband...  When he’s at work and I’m out and about, I’m not thinking “oooh look at that fine piece of ass. Damn this holy sacrament!”, I’m thinking “I’d better write a list or else I’ll forget the damn asparagus again”. And hubby is such a homebody that I have no idea when he’d have the time to cheat, lol. He’d have to have a clone or something. Or everyone in his office would have to be complicit in a massive coverup so he could screw around with the one woman who works there, and is in her 60’s 😂

 Seriously, what people need to do is grow tf up and not always be obsessed with trying to achieve happiness by always having “more”. If you’re not satisfied with just your spouse, that’s a deeper issue than not having enough slam pieces.",2017-12-29 17:43:47

dkas1t,"Wouldn't say that social media and Reddit is representative the entire internet.  But yeah it would be interesting to see lol.

Excessive sarcasm, usage of memes and edgy jokes is the type of content that had become contemporary because there is this almost competitive attitude on social media to be the funniest person and earn the Reddit high score contest. ( Karma )

Imho the internet is a more honest representation of how truly immature and dark society is as a whole since we have free space to show our real selves without risk of scrutiny or consequence.  We are pretty pathetic nowadays if you ask me.

Historians won't be around anyway to have the chance to interpret our social media conversations anyways because the mass scale AI take over is eminent.  Jk. 😂",2019-10-20 15:33:07

My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭

In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as ""R/Wooooosh"" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile.

I'm in that exact situation... I actually left a year ago to live on my own on the other side of the country, but I couldn't afford to live by myself *and* get the mental health services I needed. So I had to suck it up and move back and am constantly reminded what a failure/disappointment/weakling/loser I am and the butt of many really *really* mean jokes and retorts. They were always like that and I never let it get to me, but right now I'm at my worst and the things they say are about things I'm constantly trying *really* hard not to feel like shit about... But at least they only charge me $200 a month for rent.

d19r79,"Ok. What's a one upper?🤔   Is flat-out honesty always the 'right' choice? No, I don't agree that it's always the right choice but it does have its purposes. Again, it depends on the situation and the person that's being addressed and the person doing the addressing. For example, if your co-worker, boss, friend, parents, whoever have a issue with you about a particular thing they may give you subtle  hints about it in hopes that you catch on and correct the error in a efficient manner. If that doesn't work, they have to be aggressive toward you acknowledging the problem and resolving it. Some people avoid this because it leads to physical/verbal confrontation so they ignore or just accept it. Before I call people on their shit, I make sure I  have concrete facts about whatever it is I am or will be confronting them about. It's mostly about your approach.",2019-09-09 00:10:25

Anyway, we get to the course, and my friend was wearing a dark blue top, has blonde hair and is a medium build. Getting golf clubs loaded up, buying stuff, and getting to the practice green, I see my friend with his back to me on the putting green, dark blue top, blonde hair, medium build. He has a muffin in his hand. I approach from his blind side, thinking that  a chunk of his muffin might be a fair trade for the half snickers of mine he ate. I reach across him and grab a piece of it before he can react. Nonchalantly eating a chunk of muffin, I hear a voice. ""Oh...just go ahead...help yourself then!""

It wasn't my snickers robbing friend. It was a different dude.  Same build as my mate, wearing the same kinda stuff - I couldn't tell that it was not him. Now I got a guy who just had a stranger lean in and eat some of his stuff, right outta the blue. He did see the funny side when he looked over and saw my mate, who he had to admit looked every bit his twin that day.

cjlxoa,"My mom married this crazy dude when I was about 12 who she didn't know had a history of bipolar and had gone off his meds. (this is why you don't marry someone you just met).

One summer day I had forgotten something at home when we had already left and had to turn around to go get it. I sat in the car while she ran in the house. Idk what happened next but he had some sort of mental break and they started fighting. He followed her outside and at one point he had her up against the side of his van by her throat. I sat in the front seat of my mom's car in our driveway frozen bc I had no idea what to do. Until I saw my mom's cell phone she had left when she ran in the house. 

So I called 911. Something I'd never done before bc I was a kid. And the woman on the line helped me through one of the scariest moments of my life. She could hear him screaming at my mom in the background and still calmed me down enough to get the information she needed to send help. Then she stayed on the line to make sure I was safe. I try not to think about that day bc I had nightmares about him for years after that but when I do, I remember the stranger that calmed me with just her voice while I thought my mom was going to be killed in front of me.

I ended up accidentally pulling the tooth out, I raised my hand as I tried to cup my hand around my mouth and she just ignored me until I stained the carpet, then of course she yelled at me. Yeah yell at the autistic kid that’s a good idea, also couldn’t speak at the time 😂 I’m not stupid but at that age had hearing so bad I couldn’t really speak at all",2019-09-08 02:59:39

Why would you think ripping out the other teeth is cheaper, that's an open surgery with insane risk of infection, the aftercare alone is more expensive than just fixing the damn tooth.

awu0nw,"This is a thought I have regularly. 

I used to be an Uber driver and one day I picked up a woman who was leaving her daughters party for their new adopted baby. She explained how difficult and expensive it was for them to adopt and all they wanted was a little girl to bring into the family. Her daughter could not naturally have children, and the process took longer than 9 months (and cost significantly more). She said that she has never seen her daughter more happy than the day they met her. 

Ever since then, I’ve had this thought. I have seen many people who do not deserve the children they have, and others who are more than willing to give that child a wonderful life. 

Hurts my heart 😢",2019-03-03 17:52:49

Buuut. This is just a huge social problem. I'm a pretty soft, empathetic  and loving guy. But when I come across  certain people, i can't help but boil. It's not socially acceptable to say anything either.

Like i have seen this dozens of times..  These families of 4+ , all or most of them are disabled due to obesity and they buy tons of food (or just, you know dont do things to burn calories) that will add to the disease.. These people live better than I do by leaps and bounds. I work full time, I'll stop to save a lost dog. Pull branches out of the road - little shit like that. I'd like to think im above average as far as my impact on my society goes. I can't even afford health care. But they get it free. So do the 1%'ers, more or less. But I know there are so, so many productive worker bees that are pretty muched fucked in that reguard. Despite us doing all of the heavy lifting in society 😣",2019-03-03 18:58:40

Unless you stay on an endless cycle of payments and early upgrades and treat it like a year lease then 😑.

You do realize you can use whatever third-party accessories you want right? I don't need to buy an Apple approved flash drive. 

At the end of the day Apple products are still considered some of the most reliable and best performing devices on the market. No, no one cares about your modded PC or android. You're a very small minority of consumers. 

Edit: I'm talking about custom ROMs on android and custom PCs. Very small market share. They're great but please don't confuse that with being the norm. Your mom is going to buy a standard run-of-the-mill Dell and your dad is going to buy whatever android he likes. Quality will vary. Not on Apple. 

Edit 2: Also have you talked to Apple support. Everyone there speaks English instead of being routed to the Philippines or India and will practically suck your dick to keep you as a customer.

6dt0oz,"Keep in mind. EVERYTHING Iphone has EVERYTHING, comes from Android. 

The idea for IOS was ORIGINALLY created by Nokia. Apple STOLE it. Then when Nokia tried to fight back. Apple all but put them in the ground. They never recovered. Hence trying window os. They're also the first to create multi touch screen technology as well. 

The original iPhone design and why Samsung today uses a similar design. Is because it's SAMSUNG'S to begin with. An idea they had but wasn't quite ready in putting out their yet. Apple got wind of it. Holy shit, they STOLE it. Whatcha know?😱 hence the massive beef. 

Samsung was the FIRST to put 8mp cameras in a cellphone (Samsung memoir circa 2008) then into the S3 3 3yrs later. Then they did it again with the S4 zoom 16mp camera. 

The S3 alone had: First to use NFC (Android NFC does WAAAYY more than just pay with the phone bro). First to have wireless charging. Smart watch (wasn't stuck to just samsung, worked on other brands as well) FIRST to have a 'smart' pen. First to use pay by phone feature. Dual screen mode, various other FIRST. 

Aluminum Uni body housing was invented by None other than HTC. HTC used Dual rear AND Dual (with wide angle) front cameras LONG before most other brands did, especially Iphone. 
 stereo speakers are their ™. to top that off, They had devices with Dre beat/Harmon Harmon/JBL internals! 
And back in 2011 they had a phone that took 3d pictures and had a 3d screen. (think 3ds but as a phone). 
First to use ultra pixel technology. 

LG. First to use laser auto focus, 2k screen (sony later made a 4k phone). G4-g6 are expandable an additional 2tb's. 

Motorola first to have water resistant internals. Back in 2010. Droid razr (also had Kevlar back) phone was garbage though. Battery life was amazing. 


Android used pull down app drawer long before iPhone did. Are fully customizable out the box. Has models to meet anyone's budget or needs. 

Check out this link. And then tell me your iPhone is better. And watch them 'innovate' this technology into the iPhone 8. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.htc.com/us/smartphones/htc-u11/buy/%23!color%3Dblue&ved=0ahUKEwjnwKCnp4jUAhVizlQKHSe2DuEQFgh-MBY&usg=AFQjCNHFGtXTUjIhXsF4BAIi0jCSJh96uQ&sig2=MudJtcAJmSpf78b0juWS8A

Most what iPhone and other androids now have today is because of brands like HTC. And it's sad they get minimal recognition for it. 

IPhone steals A LOT of ideas from smaller companies. Then turns around and claims it as there own (i sheep believe this shit too). All they have is the iOS. They don't even make their chipset man. They designed it. But don't actually build them. They are not the best. Yeah they started the smartphone craze. But each iPhone on average is 3yrs behind Android technology/features. Most those 'new' features iPhone gets. Us Android users have been enjoying for years. 

When is iPhone gonna get a built in ir blaster? Expandable memory? Laser auto focus? Ultra pixel technology so you can get better low light photos? Above 12mp cameras? 16mp front cams? 

Samsung gear before Apple watch. Google wallet (now called Google pay) 2 yrs before Apple pay. 
Samsung Note Stylus before i-pen 

Etc. 

There is NOTHING iPhone has/had that Android hasn't done years prior. ",2017-05-31 02:50:06

Planned obsolescence (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence).

> Producers that pursue this strategy believe that the additional sales revenue it creates more than offsets the additional costs of research and development and opportunity costs of existing product line cannibalization. In a competitive industry, this is a risky strategy because when consumers catch on to this, they may decide to buy from competitors instead

If there's enough people willing to always pay for the New Thing©, it doesn't matter that some people will just keep using the Previous Thing© because it's​ still more than adequate.

Has the advantage that the rest of us can just buy slightly older tech at a discount, which is still perfectly serviceable.

Apple NFC didn't come out till the iPhone 6. Samsung was Already using it in the S3 2 yrs prior (source: I still have one). WITH the pay by phone feature. Google wallet was available 3yrs before Apple pay. 

Android NFC can transfer data/files, work with special 'stickers' that when you tapped your phone on them. It automatically sets user preset options to start/stop. Pay by phone feature (Google pay/Samsung Pay/LG Pay etc)


Iphone nfc Only Works with Apple pay. That's all it does. 

IPhone ONLY works with Apple products. 

Samsung Gear (smart watch) isn't just samsung only. And can work on ANY smart watch capable Android. Same goes for motorolas, and LG smart watches. 

We have universal charging ports. A Samsung wireless charger can work with other wireless charging capable androids. Etc. 

Since my S3 was able to transfer data via NFC. I tried to transfer photos (because it'll come out in full resolution that way) to a relatives iPhone 6 plus. First via Bluetooth. Her iPhone would not allow Bluetooth transfer from Android to iPhone. 

Then we tried NFC. That was before I discovered iPhone does NOT transfer Data via NFC. 

The IPhone 7 plus. Dual camera. HTC has been using dual rear cameras since 2011. 

Stereo speakers. It's HTC's™. Been using them since 2011 as well. HTC Rezound not only had Dre beat internals, but came with Dre beat headphones as well. 

HTC M8 (2014) Stereo speakers with Harmon karmon internals. Dual 4 ultra pixel rear camera. 

HTC desire Eye. 16mp dual FRONT camera. Back in 2014. 


The uni body aluminum housing used since the iPhone 4 was in fact INVENTED and a ® by HTC. Look it up. First used in the M7 iirc.

Aux port delete. Motorola and LeEcco were the first 2 companies to do that. A year or so Before Apple did. 

Fingerprint scanner. Android had that as early as 2012. 

Can you wake/sleep an iPhone by tapping the screen? Can you use a serious of taps to ""unlock"" your iphone? 

Can you use live wallpaper? (since 2010). 

Can you watch videos in 2k or 4k resolution? 

You didn't even look up the HTC u11 did you? Now THAT is progress. 

The Galaxy S5 was the first to have a built in IR blaster (something companies are phasing out now, but really fun to have). 

Once again. HTC has been using Aluminum uni body housing (after all they invented it). Stereo speakers, dual cameras FRONT and Back for years now. Granted they haven't used stereo speakers or dual cameras since the m8. Which most HTC users are like WTF? Since it was hands down their two best features. 

They lead in selfie pictures though. 

I'm on my 3rd LGG4 (yeah they don't live long😒). But it's a 2015 device. 6 cores, 2k mild curved screen, genuine leather back, laser auto focus, 16mp rear, 8mp front. 5.5 inch display. Ir blaster, removable battery, 32gb internal, expandable an additional 2tb's, 3 gbs of ram, wireless charge capable. Was a $700 phone in 2015. 

I got it NEW from Best Buy on contract 6 months after release for Only $68 on contract. Its the same size as an iPhone 6s plus. Granted it has a severe manufacture defect in them. They OWN the shit out of iPhone 6s/6s plus. All for a fraction of the cost. I currently have a 128gb SD card in it. So that's 160gb of memory. For less than HALF what an iPhone 6s plus with only 64gb internal goes for. 

My G3 (2014) has all those same features but the leather back, and 13mp rear. 2.1 mp front. And only expandable an additional 128gb I think. 

In general. Android gives you more bang for less money. Than iPhone does. 

Android phones are basically jail broken iPhones, straight from factory. 

Have you ever even had an Android flagship? Not cheapy. That's what most Apple users base Android on. They get the WRONG phone. Then condemn the entire brand. With iPhone. You've seen one, you've seen them all. As that's all iOS makes. No other styles/sub models.

Wound up with three extra chickens that flew over an 8’ fence. They foraged the yard with our regular crew all day then went to bed in the coop that night. Lined up on the roost with the rest of them like they’d always been there. They were an unfamiliar breed though... larger than bantams, but not as round as standard layers.

Side note, reincarnation is real. All forms of life are good and precious but there’s a progression through life forms and then ultimate return home to our Source. Also progression is not possible until lessons of the level are completed, killing yourself doesn’t work, you just return to the same lesson.

a0tulf,"Personally I try to limit my caffeine intake these days but caffeine isnt anymore of a “drug” then serotonin or any of the countless other chemicals in the body, so lets get real. 

Its a natural chemical that a completely undeveloped prehistoric man wandering in the forest could very reasonable come to ingest. 

In fact thats likely why we know about it today.

But hey whatever, I am open minded but if we are going to classify it as a drug then we also have to face the reality that its unregulated, any child can purchase it from basically every store on the planet, a huge percent of floorspace and sales for almost every retailer in the country has this drug, and that essentially anyone working at any of these retailers, Walmarts, Targets, Krogers, gas stations, Starbucks, all fast food restraunts, all diners, cafes, and *Churches* etc are *drug dealers* and so if that axiom is true then there really is zero free will here as every corner of society now deals drugs.

Sometimes we have to have a practical line on subjective terms such as drugs.

If I see a spectacular sunrise, or the growth of a child, a beautiful woman, and the imagery produces serotonin in my body, has the the sun, the child, the woman then become my drug dealer?

Sometimes this world seems pretty silly.

8enp6j,"I work at a help desk type thing in a library sometimes. As in, I just sit there and wait for people to need help, but it’s right out in the common area. There is one girl who is there every single time I work. I notice, because I notice these things and she sits pretty close to the desk each time. Another thing she does is walk around. All. The. Time. So I’m almost never looking up, but when someone moves by the desk I look up at them to make sure they are coming over to me or not. So each time she walks by it’s like this:

😪😶🙄😐 

And back to just staring at the desk. Well I’m always conscious of eye contact and I’m always nervous the regulars might think I’m staring, and one day she was making a ton of noise. So I would glance over occasional, cause it’s a library and literally nothing else is going on. Well at one point she straight up takes a picture of me. I know, because shutter sound. And when I looked over she had this like, annoyed look on her face. And then she did this real smug look and turned back around. 

I don’t think I’ve ever been more annoyed by anything in my entire life. I’m not a bad looking person, and I’m good at my job and I’m really polite, but mostly I just want to sit there and not talk to anyone, and go home. And I definitely don’t ever want to meet this person, and I was absolutely not staring at her in some kind of creepy way. 

This was like a year ago, and she still shows up there all the time, but I intentionally don’t acknowledge she is there. I don’t know why, the picture and the smug look just really pissed me off, and like.. I look at everybody that walks by. It sucks, because making eye contact was something my therapist made me start doing when I felt isolated in my depression, and I do it when I work at the desk now too. It starts conversations outside of the desk, while working there it draws the people who are clearly lost and need help finding something. I dunno, this is the only time it’s ever caused s problem and I still hold a grudge about it, like a year later. Lol 

TL:Dr I work at a Help/reference desk in a library, and a regular patron took a picture of me and gave a smug/mocking look after she walked by a dozen times and i looked at her. I look at people when they walk by because I’m barely conscious cause everyday is a slow day andneed to make sure they aren’t walking toward me. ",2018-04-25 02:10:33

These sentient beings understand their unique physical systems require athletic training for improving longevity, and while working this effort will knowingly pursue the one they cannot catch, the Supreme.

Predators usually grab the slowest (if there's a bunch) which may be the youngest, sickest, or eldest of the prey, which at times may also be another predator.

In human bouts they honor these demonstrations as ""friendlies"", and are a placeholder to exchange current knowledge bases as well as indicators on future placement within hierarchies, if they exist.

Sorry.. 🙏",2019-08-07 18:24:06
cn8ayi,"Sigh :(

I’ve seen my dad get emotional before. But never the way he did when we had to put our dog down just 3 months ago. He broke down like his child had passed, ended up running back inside the vet’s multiple times to say one last word to him and still to this day breaks down when he thinks of him. 

He feels like he betrayed the dog; he feels as if though he should have gone naturally but it was just his time. Heart/liver failure != a good quality of life. :(

One was so sick within a week that overnight when I got him to the vet, they said he wouldn't recover and it was suggested he be put to sleep. Same thing happened to his brother no long after.

cn8ayi,Happened to my grandma a few weeks ago 😪 her sweet baby (who was my baby too) started acting really strange going in/out of the house trying to use the bathroom constantly. Grandma took her to the emergency vet in the middle of the night and the dog started throwing up nonstop and turned out she was having some type of liver failure and they had to put her down. So unexpected. I loved her so much and went with my grandma to pick her out and get her when I was a kid.,2019-08-08 00:45:00

cn8ayi,"Been there as well 😭. It was a few years ago. My pup was old and needed to be put down. I still remember the day super vividly. I remember my dad telling me to say goodbye because he was going to bring him to the vet in the morning. I cried and hugged him before he left.

That same day later in the afternoon, my other pup had some type of epileptic attack and my sister and I took her to the same vet to get her checked up. We get that sorted and all is good. As we walk outside we hear our boxer’s bark. I don’t know how he knew we were there but he knew. And holy shit that destroyed us. They hadn’t put him down yet and he knew we were there. And we left him there. I still cry about it when I reminisce. 

I will never ever leave another dog at a vet like that. If they need to be put down, they will be put down while I hold them and say my goodbyes.",2019-08-08 01:17:59

cn8ayi,"Nope nope nope.... the feells... the feels are to strong. Hold it back... hold it back........ 😭😭😭 i lost both my cats 1 week apart, then my dog a month after.... all were old and lived a very happy life.... but my heart hurts to much.... its been a year now.... and i still feel the bed bounce from my cats... i take the urn box 's of my cats and hold them close to me and cry uncontrollably. 

My cats saw me from age 16 up to 21 with my first girlfriend. My first heart break. Being homeless... moving back to my moms... to finding someone, moving out with me... then just 5 years after my wife and i got together.... they passed.... and now I'm 29. They passed when i was 28... my heart... 


Facebook memories popped up and showed me a picture of them..... i cried so hard.  I'm crying now. :(  

I never tried to get another cat... i dont think i could bare another death.... :( 

My dog was my moms. And while i am heart broken about him. My cats were my everything. They comforted me in the most darkest of times... the cuddles. The meows, the licks... my tabby would cuddle up to my like push herself into my and purrsleep. My black cat would lay above my head, and the way she would wake me up in the morning would be to lick my head with her sandpappery tongue. That was a sure way of waking me up to get them food. Lmao. My black cat would lay between my legs on the covers so i HAD to lay on my back. If i were to move she would attack my leg until i move it back. Lol.  The memories of these 2 i have is far more special than anything i could even fathom. 

My wife knows my heart ache and tries to comfort me. When you've had animals, more specifically cats a good portion of your life. They're not just pets or just animals. They're family. I held my cats higher in regards to family than most of my family. Honestly.",2019-08-08 01:24:50

Brought her in swaddled in her baby blanket with her favorite toy. She had on her collar with her ID tag. We held her every step of the way. When it was time to leave, we left her sweet, limp little body still swaddled up on the table with the other things. 

The vet took an imprint of her paw on a piece of clay and when they called us to pick it up, they had folded her blanket up and put it in a little bag with her toy and collar. I started crying immediately. We left it there for a reason 😢",2019-08-07 21:03:47

cn8ayi,"I’m so sorry. It’s truly tragic. I bought a cockatiel, she was 6 months old, and we brought her into the vet one day because she was weirdly clumsy. We left hours later with an empty cage. It was some sort of neurological issue. We only had her for 3 weeks....

We were taking out the trash and had to throw away the box we took her home in. I sobbed the whole way down to the garbage bin and back... It hurts so, so bad. The only reason I’m remotely okay is because I get to take care of my other birdies every day

vacxv7,My best friend was off birth control for 8+ years and she and her now husband were together that entire time and did the pull out game. The month that she decided to stop that (right after they got married) she got pregnant. She now has a beautiful baby boy that is 6 months old and looks just like her husband. She never thought it would happen that quickly and was always worried she had fertility issues. We both did. But I ended up with the fertility issues and she ended up with an accidental pregnancy 🤷🏼‍♀️,2022-06-12 11:49:41

She claims her family is extremely fertile, but that she has never been pregnant and literally said ""pull out method is 80% effective"" like that was a good thing 😆. I don't know her well enough to say anything, but definitely wanted to comment that just because your family is fertile doesn't mean you are 😬. Thankfully she doesn't want kids so it won't be an issue for her. You learn a lot about a person when drinking with them 4 days straight haha",2022-06-12 17:23:08

I'm up in the 20s now and haven't got a single girl pregnant. Maybe 5 of those were protected.

He refused but they were together 5 more years and she didn't get pregnant again until she was with the next guy after she kicked him out. We had been trying to conceive without luck when my cervical cancer was discovered. I was told I may not be able to conceive after treatment (he even admitted that's why he started cheating). When I started dating my husband I got pregnant (eptopic 😞 one birth control) a few years later when we decided to try for kids I stoped birth control and was pregnant within 6 weeks, then 2nd pregnancy was on birth control again and still got pregnant.

My infertility cause was actually pretty rare. Like 1 and a billion. Except three other cousins in my family also had it. Seems like it’s either genetic or environmental. 

However, I guess I did make men think their pullout game was strong?

4w63jp,"What happens if neither partner can do certain things because the other partner? I had a friend back in high school, she was in a LDR with a guy 5 years older than her, they've been dating since she was 11. Ew, right? So over the course of our friendship I find out just how fucked up their relationship is. Every single morning they pick out each others outfits over Skype. Each has to approve of the other's outfit before they can leave the house. This is to prevent the other from wearing something too revealing or too sexy. Literally every second of every day they must be aware of the other's location, what they're doing and  who they're with. An argument will ensue if one doesn't update their location with the other. The guy is only allowed to play video games while the girl is at work, the second she's done he has to turn off the console and talk to her. There have been many arguments because he lost track of time playing the game and she heard it in the background. 

I stopped being friends with her a while back but I heard they it married 😂",2016-08-05 11:40:16

9jvzad,"I think many people feel this way and try their hardest to not be like their parents but because a lot of them never learned *how to not* behave that way (never having a good example on how to behave as an adult or seeing it but never getting help to learn) 

So it can lead down the path of over-compensation and not finding moderation between their parents bad behavior and the far opposite. 
Or people while trying to not be that way end up doing exactly what they hated because they are subconsciously trying to recreate that “comfort” of their upbringing because were wired that way- but unfortunately their upbringing was not healthy and not comforting but never truly came to terms with it. 

It’s hard to change and people who have been doing things a way for so long find it easier to just continue doing what they’re doing rather than face the painful truth and all its consequences. 
Coming to terms with their parents behavior and then their own behavior and how it’s effected everyone in their lives. 
To many that’s a serious breakdown and living in denial is easier. 

I’m sure you’re doing what’s right, just popped in my head. Sorry for the rant. :😅

It was snowing at the airport and EVERY airline EXCEPT frontier cancelled their flights due to the snow storm 🙃...Long story short my bf knocked out on the flight and I'm awake stoned as hell and freaking out bc every 10 feet they have to defrost our plane before it took off.

Luckily I had one suitcase I was going to check, but it was too heavy and I was asked by the stafg to move some weight to my carry on. 

While moving some shirts - boom - sitting there plain as day, there it was 😱! *minor cardiac event* 

So I collect myself, act cool and scooped it up into a magazine I was going to read from my carry on. Checked my suitcase, got my boarding pass and tossed the mag with the ehh, offending substance, in the paper recycling can at those last chance trash cans before hitting the TSA line. Whew! ✌🏻

I think of all the compulsions one can have, there's 4 types that seem particularly destructive: Hoarding, Spartanism, Harm, and Pedophilia. Hoarding and spartanism OCD, while they are the exact opposite of each other, are the most physically destructive; and harm and pedophile OCD are the most psychologically destructive.

arkhuj,"The shroom deer piss that people drank was from the amanita muscaria mushroom, aka fly agaric. It’s the classic red mushroom with white dots that’s everywhere in pop culture, even emojis 🍄. It isn’t a psychedelic and it’s very different from psilocybin, the psychedelic “magic mushroom.” 

Amanita muscaria is a hypnotic, the same class of drug as ambien and many other sleeping medications. In low doses, it makes you relaxed or sleepy, and might be compared to alcohol. High doses though, invoke a dissociative state where you become less grounded in reality. It’s hard to explain, but it isn’t really psychedelic. 

These mushrooms are toxic and should be avoided. The drug itself is harmless, but the mushroom has a few other highly toxic chemicals in it. ",2019-02-17 16:29:49

I mean I had a running plot with my barbies that everyone’s best friend Erica was really Eric and was hiding her gender. She was the best bitch out of everyone.

9krmze,"You have the most underrated comment of the entire thread.

I am a physics major, I’ve simply loved math and science since I was really young and I was always intrigued by things that moved, cool pictures of stars and galaxies, and just generally learning about things...  I’d add to your comment (though your comment is 10000% perfect as it is) that If you AT LEAST have a passing interest in problem solving, you could enjoy science and dabble in curiosities that affect you, your community’s, your nation’s, your planet’s, your solar system’s daily life—and beyond.  I don’t care if you’re an atheist or on the same level/are the highest ranking person in your religion.  I don’t care if you’re an extreme rightist or leftist, black, white, human, non-human, or identify as a breakfast food, or The Pillars of Creation.... Regardless of your view, we’re either born with talent or we refine our talents, or even some mix of the two.  We are all capable of enjoying the process of solving problems and learning about things in the meantime... Are you super religious and you follow the word of your god?  I’m sure it’s thrilling using your hard-earned gifts to learn more deeply how your God made your reality, thus leading you to better understand yourself, the nature of your god, and everything around you.  Do you not believe in god?  I’m sure it’s super thrilling being what appears to be an organized set of molecules (relatively speaking) that is not only part of this grand universe, but where, inexplicably, you experience consciousness and by extension of being matter here and now,  are a piece of the Universe understanding itself... Regardless of which I am, and which you may identify with, you can probably take something from me.

Truthfully, I’m not the most talented person (though I brag about my excel abilities from time to time, and I take some pretty dope sports photos).  Thanks to life, and a few things that hindsight 20/20 tells me I could have avoided, but that seemed unavoidable in my younger years, I’m only now finishing up my degree...  I’m 28, and effectively at the beginning of my physics training with many many years without quality math and science courses between now and a distant past.  I have a 3.2 gpa currently and all that’s been pushing me through and carrying me through my courses is a general interest and a passion for being human.  I’m by no means perfect and I honestly try to improve myself, BUT....

If I can do it, you can do it too.

Your fellow humankind needs you.

More importantly... Who YOU are needs you. 😊

Stay curious.

eyb8gu,"Haha pretty much. And the bigger the horns on a male would be something for them to be proud of while some of those with the skinny short horns would be insecure about the size of their horns that everyone could see so no one could get away with lying about the horns they’re packing. 

What would seem to be the common shape for horns seen more frequently would be regarded as being “normal,” “ordinary,” and “healthy.” The unusual shaped horns rarely seen would be called “hereditary,” “unique,” “odd,” “exotic,” “freakish,” “weird,” or a “deformity.” People would often ask if they could touch these strange looking horns that they are curious about whenever they happened to cross paths with a human who’s horns have an uncommon shape to them. But that doesn’t mean all horns aren’t created equal, but try telling that to those who are prideful or insecure about their horns and they will be the ones to argue that in their experience it’s not true that all horns are created equal, but those with common ordinary horns will  try to correct and educate those prideful big horn humans and those insecure scrawny horned humans that they are wrong, all horns no matter their shape or size are indeed created equal by the Alhorny God. And they must be right since that’s reinforced as the prevalent perception among the commonly shaped horned humans so they win by default and get to write all the text books of truth about horns being that they are the moral majority on all matters for all the horny humans of the world. 😂",2020-02-04 09:45:07

pky140,"I'm way late to the party, but I do have what's called persistent genital arousal disorder, which I think the best way I could describe it is, yeah, it's like my clit is constantly swollen all day (which the clit actually, like, is a rather large sensitive muscle that covers more area than just that fun little nub. The button is just the part you can see 👀) and while I will say I am lucky in that my issue isn't as extreme as some women I've met, it still is definitely a frustration. It's like constantly being just a hair's breadth away from an orgasm. I sit down and cross my legs and the sensation of it will, yes, cause an unprompted panty pool party. My clit is basically in pound-town mode 24/7. 

It does get uncomfortable because sitting for too long can cause not only just a general soreness, but I also run the risk of there being a fun little wet spot once I stand up. 

It's also led to orgasms just not being as satisfying because I can reach one incredibly easily.

OP ought to be downvoted to oblivion for posting such dumbassery.

dgnm34,"This was actually a myth from decades ago, the whole drugs in candy thing. If this ever happens which is only once in a blue moon btw, it's never a random stranger. It's always a parent or someone close to the child. And yes! Edibles are also ridiculously expensive! As a medical marijuana patient I got a cookie yesterday for $10 and change. One...cookie... I'm sorry but NO ONE is going out and dropping a few hundred on edibles to give out to kids on Halloween for shits and giggles, I mean really?! 😂",2019-10-12 12:32:38

bvwgx8,"It's quite cool, I just read the abstract.  
  
Imagine you're just staring into your room. You close one eye and see with the other. You focus at the nearest object (so that's the clearest) and then you kind of shift your focus to the furthest object (so that's now the clearest and the one near is blurry).   
   
Thing is that you were only using one eye, so how were you able to determine what was the object further away and near to you (without any depth of field from using two eyes)?   
  
  
  
Now same with cuttlefishes. They look at the same object and ""focus"" by adjusting their lens (like how we adjust ours to bring the object of interest into field) until that object is clear.   
  
Now the thing is that to us, we have multiple colour cones so any object at any depth will have sharp colours.  For a cuttlefish, they only have sigle receptor so they only see black thru white. 

But for them, different objects with different colours come into focus at different distances.   
  
Imagine a rainbow flag 🌈. Assuming it's doing a eye test and it focuses its eye to a fixed point at the back of the wall. Now the doctor with sandwich breathe puts that flag near the squid eye. The squid sees one part of the flag clearly with sharp contrast (im gonna guess the purple side) while the other part is fuzzy (gonna guess the red part)  
   
Doctor now walks away and the cuttlefish is still focusing at the back wall. Now has the doctor moves back the redder part of the flag starts getting clearer and sharper while the violet part gets blurrer^((im gonna hazard a guess and say that it starts getting blur and the not blur and keep switching, since it has a smaller wavelength so it should at one point cycle until its in phase with the red and both are clear, and then again the red starts slowly getting blurrer while the purple faster turns blur and then clear then blur, until at one point both are very blur. That will explain how it will see mixes of colour like pink))  
  
  
The cuttlefish is just seeing which colour looks as sharp as the background and matches with it  
  
We are just overevolved to have to bother with the inconvenience of having to see different colours getting blurry at different distances just because the wavelength of light that enters the lens doesn't converge nicely and hit the back of the eyes perfectly. 
  
  
  
Now you're happy knowing this knowledge of cuttlefish colour. You walk away, the doctor confirms its eyesight is doing fine albeit the gray outlook in life, and he proceeds to test the reflex of its 8 tentacles with a rubber hammer",2019-06-02 18:39:36

The conscious part of the brain has a choice, it is rational, it weighs up the pros and cons etc. But with addiction it seems like people are fighting with the basic part of their brain, which is scheming to have another cigarette or burger. 

My personal fight is to stop being addicted to the internet. I want to stop checking reddit right before I go to bed and as soon as I get up. I know this will make my mental state and personal relationships better but I can’t seem to break the habit. 🙃",2019-03-21 21:48:03

A lot of the time, my office's doctors run late because patients end up finding out they actually have a Big Problem that they originally thought was No Big Deal. And then, they have to break it to the patient gently and refer them out to a specialist. 

Patient: Oh, I get some little fuzzy things in my vision. And some flashes of light sometimes? There's also a big black spot in the center of my vision. I think I'm just on my computer too much??

(doc sees signs of retinal detachment that needed surgery YESTERDAY)

Doc: ...about that.... (internal screaming that echos front desk's internal screaming because the rest of the day's schedule is fucked)

I'd like to think that most of our patients understand waiting a bit in order for us to take proper care of them. I mean, wouldn't you want the doctor to take extra time with you if your ""migraine aura"" complaint turned out to be something that could leave you sightless? 

Or some patients are just super talkative and/or won't let the doctor get a word in edgewise. That takes time, too. 🤷‍♀️",2020-02-03 15:30:23

Big ole’ powerful Des arrived to his planned Christmas party with the Fam.  His mom just got a big settlement and the family is a buzz.  Dudes got on his nicest clothes and the boots is ace.  Doorbell ring (only once cus big Des doesn’t want to seem anxious).  About 43 seconds later his  aunt answers, “hey sweetie!  It’s been sooo looong.  We so happy you made it.  Come on in sweetheart”.  Big o fucking Des walks in with his Christmas ham and 3 bundles  of gifts straight to the kitchen, cus where the fuck else a ham gonna be. 

Everyone is busy chatting it up and being busy in the family room and their loud laughter and voices tell it true.  
Des ain’t bout that shit. 

Big boi mr powerful Des shoots through the door to the family room and of course everyone is so happy and elated to see their little big boy so grown up and manly.  Big boi gives out his first gift to his grandma.  She’s teary eyes as fook and so grateful to be the first on big bad Des list of people to love on.  She opens her gift and it’s an 8 pack of double A batteries.  She’s super excited because her tv remote was going out (grandpa died recently) and double As are what she needs not to mention they power her blender, iRobot, etc.  The most thoughtful gift.
 
Big fuckin boi Des is bout that shit.  He hands his next gift to his precious aunt.  She grabs it and eyes him a happy you did it smile.  Her gift is wrapped so tightly and in black plastic.  It takes her a moment to rip through the plastic with her acrylic nails but she finally gets to it.  She begins to open the gift and reveals the biggest bottle of Lambda ever seen.  “You big boi Des, gtfo this is the shit! How did you get this!???”  Big fucking body boi Des stays quiet and just winks!  Big Des made his aunt proud with the Lambda.

Next gift is to big boi Des moms.  She’s been sickly with throat cancer and big Des ain’t bout dat shit. Being the big appreciative big boi Des motha fucka he is, he gives her a professional expensive microphone 🎤. 

She asks, “big boi Des why you give me a gift, I can’t use?”

Big fuckin boi Des:  “momma you missed the point of our family Christmas.  Grandma will have extra batteries for your mic,  aunty can lube it up, and you can finally fuck me over.  ",2017-12-02 08:49:49

I joked and said “well I haven’t see a unicorn before”

She came back after 6 months and dumped me. This was a few weeks before our 8 year anniversary.

I was alone in Alaska in her house (we bought another this one in her name) having to drive her to work and live with her. It was the most depressing time of my life.

kn12cx,"So there are a bunch of different theories about this but the best explanation I've heard is that it's because it's working, but not fully yet. Ideally SSRIs and SNRIs will reduce depression symptoms by improving your mood and energy levels, but not necessarily together or in that order. Some folks with depression go on meds and within a couple weeks, have more energy... to carry out their suicide plan 😑 ... and do so because the hopelessness they were feeling hasn't abated yet. It sucks. But usually if you can keep people safe during that transitional period (a month or two) until the meds have fully kicked in at a therapeutic dose, they'll feel a lot better and the risk of suicide will decrease.",2020-12-30 19:39:27

Im on meds for both at the moment, and Im happy to feel ""normal"" for once? Feels good man. Take that for what you will, and good luck! 👍",2020-12-30 20:18:20

kn12cx,"Absolutely. I got diagnosed with adhd earlier this year. Once I started treatment I felt so much better. There’s also an emotional aspect of ADHD that isn’t mentioned a lot, where people get mood swings or in my case can dwell on depression. Strattera made things so much better. Then Covid hit and it got worse again 🤦‍♂️",2020-12-30 15:35:54
kn12cx,"Care to, uhh, argue with any of it? Or are you done with that? Lmao. Directly to the ad hominem, in true capitalist fashion. Y'all are uneducated as hell and it really shows. Although it's understandable that you are upset, the propaganda is deeply internalized, and having one's core values attacked provokes a primal response. Have a good day, my good bitch. I hope your new year is better than this one has been, and I hope the crumbling system you love and perpetuate doesn't kill us all before you can see another new year. 💜",2020-12-31 15:12:41

ljqgay,"OHhHhH... got me....oh wait .......My personal preference and what I like as a human is not toxic.  I don't like receiving flowers from women as a man.  That's not toxic.  That's just my opinion and what I believe.

Your not even 40 yet! How dare you call yourself old-school.  Settle the fuck down, Sport.  🙂

See how I put "" downvote away reddit"" 

That was for people that I knew would type out some long, dumbass paragraph like you did telling me how I am toxic.


Flowers are for girls and as a man. I think it's weird if a girl gives a man flowers.


Fuck your PC bullshit. I don't give a fuck about it ,boss. Not one bit lol.

Sport, you try to act like your this big tough dude with a beard (lol) who loves flowers like some random chick is going to PM you and be like "" man, I like how you really told that toxic masculine dude off. Can I please suck you off now ""


I'm not insecure.  Happily married with a kid.  Big ass dude with a big ass beard whom is an industrial electrician. By all means, I fit the stereotype of a masculine dude. 

You don't know shit about me, my sexual orientation, my personal life, my sex life etc etc, but I see you re assuming quite a  lot in your weak ass attempt at scoring those imaginary PC points. 

Then you even go on to do the modern day "" I have a black friend"" thing talking about your trans friend who drives some Ford truck or something while you fuck him in the ass with pink shoes on. Whatever , I stopped reading your nonsense about then so forgive me I got it a bit wrong .

Just stop and go fuck yourself ,boss.",2021-02-15 00:02:55

ljqgay,"It really will be! Like even the worst luck can’t go on forever, right? Like, how many bad things can happen in a row, really? After a while, it would be almost comical to see what else life would throw at you. (Like my friend who got a freakin sponge left in her during surgery, had all her money stolen by fucking scammers and USAA decided it was her fault and wouldn’t replace it, husband had to get his knee replaced twice because they screwed it up the first time, and then she finally got a job after job hunting for a year to be a caregiver for a lady who died shortly after, etc. It was kind of amazing how much shit kept happening! It eventually turned around though!) Eventually, things will start to look up! Just have to keep going until then.

mc7jbb,"Humans are a part of the Earth’s biodiversity. We have every right to be here as anything else. It’s not like we came down in some spaceship and took over this planet. We evolved here and our success on this planet is due to the evolutionary traits that we inherited along the way. At one time we were pray and part of the food chain but we managed to overcome nature due to what nature has given us along our journey, mainly our minds. The problem isn’t the existence of humans, the problem is our habits. We need to instead of fighting against Mother Nature, we need to preserve her more then we are. In my opinion we have come along way in recent years however we have far to go, especially when it comes to the preservation of our biodiversity habitats like our rainforest and our ocean life. We are inherently the caregivers of the world now and I am hopeful as time goes on that more and more of us will learn from  nature and take and give back what we take plus some. In a way,  humans are nature’s success story but success can lead to catastrophic consequences if we are not careful. Just like in the micro, we need to handle our success as seriously as our failures. There are countless stories of folks who made the big time only to crash and burn because they were not prepared to handle their own successes. Same in the macro when speaking of humans as a whole in regards to our world.  🌍✌️",2021-03-24 19:43:13

I know about 5 women who have had kids in their late thirties. 


I couldn't grow, heal, and have a child at the same time because at a time when I needed to be selfish because of the things I have been through. I would have had to worry about affecting someone else's life, because I wasn't ready to have a child. You have no idea what you are talking about because you don't know what I have went through. 

At this moment I could not travel with a kid because I can only afford to take myself out of the country.

You really think I would be able to help my kid 3-4 years ago vs 7-8 years from now while dealing with the problems I have had you are delusional.

You would rather grow up with a mother who wasn't ready to have kids or with a mother who was prepared and a little older. 😂

81gyor,"Yes. But private adoption is not in our budget, and foster care's goal is reunification. I couldn't bear to give up a child I had bonded with. 

For future reference - it's not a good idea to suggest a lot of options to someone who has revealed they are infertile. It's like asking a Cancer patient if they had considered chemo. We know every single avenue to Parenthood intimately, and for one reason or another it's just not a fit for our family. It can be very painful to constantly feel like you have to explain a very personal decision. 

Most of us understand it is coming from a place of kindness and a desire to see us have what we want. When dealing with a friend or family member, a better way to go about that would be to ask questions about how your friend is feeling/doing.  Or just letting them vent a bit, without trying to help them.

I've been through a lot of pretty intense trials in life, but none have cut me to the core like infertility. Always remember that when you're speaking to infertile in your life. Compassion first.

I sure as fuck don’t want everyone sitting around sobbing over me. Plus I grew up fundy so most of the services I attended were heavy on the proselytizing and whatnot. Gross. 

That being said, I just attended a funeral this past weekend for my ex’s stepdad. He was a gentle giant who never met a stranger and loved to drink beer and laugh with his goofy ol’ grin on his face. The man who was asked to do the service was his neighbor and best friend. He told stories about them building a still together to make moonshine, drinking beer and falling off the back porch, and blasting bluegrass while riding around on Harleys. Then those in attendance shared their own memories as well. Followed by a gathering at a local bar with plenty of bbq, beer, family, and friends.

Reports show bees display erratic behavior when the majority of their diet is replaced with something else.
Corn syrup is not what the bees are meant to be eating. Honey is not ours to take. Also, we rip off the wings of queen bees to keep them from leaving the hive. Honey is yet another example of how fucked up humans are.

Sometimes I like to put a body in at around 1400 °F, but often will put it in at about 300 since the retort (chamber) is often still warm from yesterday. But honestly it get heated up so dang fast I would think that the body would char extremely fast. The retort can go from about 200-300 to 1400° in about ten to fifteen minutes. Then it will crawl up to around 1600°F and hold for a while. So yeah, maybe a tiny window of time where the meat is perfectly cooked though!

Further assuming that one is equally likely to die on any given day in a year, the probability of dying on a given day is roughly 1 in 44,000.

gshbpu,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

vgx03g,"Right? When I was young I thought my dick was average, then my first gf told me it was big, second gf as well. So I thought I had a huge dick

Eventually I started paying attention to dicks in porn and all these people online talking about having third leg sized dicks. Then I had a relationship with a woman that had a large vagina (or weak vaginal walls, idk) and I swear it was like throwing a hotdog down a hallway… so I started thinking my dick wasn’t big after all…

After looking at that sub, I feel like I have a monster dick. I knew micro-peni were a thing, I did not realize they could be so small they invert back into the body. Nor did I realize some of them can’t fit into a condom. Trojan condoms were uncomfortably tight so I tried magnums, but the magnums felt loose and I thought “man my dick isn’t big enough😑”

Now… I’m perfectly happy. God bless their souls",2022-06-21 06:12:02

Like this is you
Thread: dicks over the average length are not as popular as men often think because of the cervix gets hit during sec it can be painful

It is true that the wizards could provide solutions to many of the muggle problems but they simply don't because of self defined reasons like they might not be worthy or that they are just 'muggles'. The same goes for muggles. Even if someone did think of this, a single being has very little effect on this large society as a whole. 
One of the sad things about us humans is that deep down in our cores we are selfish even if a little bit ( and it seems our trait has been passed down to the wizards as well 😂 ).

Simba:” Its my fault hes dead😭”

Serabi: “What happened?”

Simba: “There was a stampede in the gorge, then he got trampled trying to save me 😭”

Serabi: “Oh, Simba, thats not your fault, it was an accident...”

Like...the pride isnt portrayed as stupid. The only reason Serabi believes Simba at the end when he says he killed Mufasa is because its all coming out in the middle of a chaotic situation with Scar leading the prosecution and manipulating the questions and thus Simbas answers. She even says “Tell me its not true?!” So shes very eager to believe Simba DID NOT kill Mufasa. If Scar wasnt there interrogating Simba, she definitely would have probed for more info and better understood what happened.",2020-11-12 18:31:36

 I guess but not really. Again, Its hard to explain.

If I focus on thinking about an object. I think I can see it. I can imagine of detail and texture but I dont know if I am actually seeing it or if I am simply aware of what those details are.

So for all intents and purposes I would say that can see what I am thinking about. 

But I dream in definate images so that rules out the ""cant see anything""

bsyl25,"This!! My eldest son is 11 and has always had anxiety around being away from home. This was a problem come school camp last year but the best thing we ever did was make up a book that said ‘it’s okay to feel anxious. When I feel anxious I can...’ and listed all of the strategies we used at home. Not only did it help him immensely, he was also able to share it with his friends who were feeling anxious too. He goes to camp again next week and has said he doesn’t even need to take his book this year because he knows how to cope if he gets anxious. 😍😍
My younger son is 7 and had to go to the dentist for a checkup last week. He doesn’t have anxiety per se but does have some sensitivities with sensory stuff around his head. He hates having his hair brushed or touched and eating certain foods can be an issue too. When he completely freaked out when the dentist put the vacuum thing in his mouth, I held his hand and told him I knew it was scary and that’s okay but I knew he could be brave and it would be over soon. He was amazing as he took a big breath and dealt with it even though he hated every minute, tears rolling down his cheeks. Later the dental assistant told me ‘it’s really important for them to know it’s not scary’. I just nodded because I hadn’t paid yet but I thought, what message would I be sending to my child If I said ‘this isn’t scary’ but he’s petrified? He needs to know that what he’s feeling is normal and okay, not that there’s something wrong with him for feeling that way!",2019-05-25 23:49:23
bsyl25,"Yes! I told my bf something like this. 

I always tell him when I’m feeling really anxious or panicky and could tell he wanted to help but never really knew what to do. 

So I told him the best thing for me personally, was not to tell me everything was going to be ok or there was nothing to worry about, but tell me ways to deal with it if it wasn’t ok. Such as if I were nervous about an upcoming event, don’t say it will go well and there is nothing to worry about, because my brain is overriding any logic that it will go well and thinking of a million ways it will go wrong. 

I tell him to reassure me I can leave if I want, so and so can take over instead, no one will mind if I get sick there (big source of my anxiety is about getting sick from the anxiety 🙈), etc. Together we come up with solutions to every what-if my brains comes up with (not matter how far fetched or implausible).

I know in my heart that I will do what I need to but the reassurance that I don’t HAVE to or that there is a way around everything or that I just have a way out is enough to calm me down. 

Not sure if that makes sense and might not work for everyone but I came to this idea after a lot of thinking and thought I might help someone else.",2019-05-26 03:31:23

A family friend of mine is having a baby and is spending close to 1,000 on this baby shower. She does not have a lot of money and neither do her parents. But she has to have a candy bar (like a an open alcohol bar, but with fancy candies) at her shower. 🙄🙄🙄",2017-08-11 01:44:24

That was literally just for the he venue too. Still had all the other wedding costs (dresses etc.) on top of that.  

I can't even imagine spending that much on one day of my life that's mostly for other people anyway 😂",2017-08-11 07:21:51

I don't even think that's possible for me any more. So, I say fuck it.  Killing myself is the easy way out of this god forsaken miserable waste of breath; nobody likes me anymore, nobody cares about me, my parents tell me I'm trash every single day, my ex girlfriend who I loved more than anyone on this earth won't acknowledge me any more, and my drug addiction gets worse every single day!

It's a lot easier to learn to balance if you're also not pedalling. Let them scoot around with their feet and *glide.*

Training wheels teach kids to pedal... But that's the easy part. They'll figure it out quick once they can balance. I struggled and fought with my eight year old - took off the training wheels - pushed her around - thought I was a failure of a parent. What eight year old can't ride a bike?

I think the op is right on the money with his (her?) original comment. Successful gamblers, (in the normally accepted definition of gambling - horses, casinos, Lottery, slots, Las Vegas etc) would not indeed be considered, or even consider themselves, as having a problem. Which leaves the rest of us, the great majority of gamblers. It doesn’t take long to realise you are “on a losing streak” just unlucky, were a victim of circumstances or the poor play of the fellow in box seven of a blackjack table, causing your own losses. The difference then is what you do about it. Ordinary folk may curse a bit (a lot actually) or do without something to recoup their perceived losses, and maybe lie to loved ones to cover it, but most importantly, they do not return to repeat the experiment and so get on with the rest of their lives. The ones who really become compulsive take a long time to even recognise they have a problem, let alone do something to break the vicious circle. They just carry on chasing that one magical “big win” which will solve everything for them. It’s only in retrospection we realise just how bad we were at whatever and however our particular addiction manifested itself.

eext04,"some suggestions that have helped me with this very thing: 
Since the stores start Christmas so early,  I make lists and try to get things on sale before December. I try to get the tree up the week of Thanksgiving. lots of stores have good bargains to be found then without the picked over merchandise and crowds and the salespeople have more time to assist.  I don’t do Black Friday, and tend to shop small merchants or online.
This way I have time for wrapping, decorating, baking, watching movies, working out, etc. without having stuff that HAS to be done NOW.  I try to go out at my leisure to experience the stores and decorations without HAVING to get something (other than exercise😄)but I don’t HAVE to fight the crowds and wait in lines. This results in more enjoyment of the season for me.
Another thing: you might want to find a church that celebrates Advent. I find that this helps put Christmas in perspective and gives you a small amount of time to relax and enjoy the season. The decorations are lovely and you just might make some new friends and find opportunities to help those less fortunate. 
Here’s hoping your Christmas is joyful and best wishes! 🎄🎁☃️🎅🏻",2019-12-24 17:27:04

If not, use a label such as Auntie/Uncle for everyone older than you, even if they aren't related to you. For those only slightly older, use Older Brother/Older Sister. When my MIL, an American, told me to call her using her first name, I had to explain that I can't. It's so disrespectful!

It does make a lot of sense when I think about it. But how do we remember these instincts, thousands of years later? Like, have the fear felt by our cavemen ancestors was so intense that it altered their genetics in such a way that future generations fear the dark as well as they did? We are born in an environment where we have a house,safe from animals attacking us at night, and so did our parents, and their parents but even though we are safe we still fear the dark.

asa2nz,"Generally men have a more fit body for this task and didn't risk to be pregnant, didn't risk to leave a children home without his needed milk (and the knowledge to care for him than many men didn't have) and various similar things.And while giving a guy a spear and sending him to fight is technically enough to kill another guy like him, that's a complete waste that real history army tried to avoid. If your soldiers weren't able to properly use the weapon they were useless, and if you couldn't give 'em a minimal training how could you use them in a formation etc? Not saying that peasents weren't used as cannon fodder in reality, but if you watch the big ass historical battles you won't find any data about civilians made soldiers and used at random, because they were useless.

And from the POV of Human Society As A Whole™ and are a more disposable resource as a single woman is required for every child, while a single men could, in the case required it, have more children at a time. So Men were a disposable tool you could spend for fighting, while Women were a tool you needed to protect.

It's just normal that you didn't want women on the battlefield back in the days, as they were more valuable in another place. Like, doing the work of the men who left and caring for their families.

Said so... trust me, fighting is an heavy labor. I practiced a japanese martial arts that also uses swords and now I practice HEMA, and fighting with a stick and some weight around your body is really, really, really, really heavy.It takes little time before your movements become less sharp, your footing becomes shit and so on. All these things, on an untrained body, makes for an easy target. So, as our ancestors weren't stupid at all when it comes to killing, it was just normal that you didn't use resources on a soldier that wouldn't be optimal.

  
P.S. To be clear, I am saying this from the POV of the theory of ""Gender Roles were born in our ancient tribes"", were you couldn't use a woman to hunt when your tribe was composed by 20 men and 12 women and maybe 30 children, and all those 12 risked to die when giving birth to children.

It's about sexuality nor about sexism. This is just a pure practical analysis according to the real world needs of our ancestors.   
It's not until the modern age that medicine reduced the risk of death by birth to a minimum and that our economy supported the develop of equal rights between women and men (who, I guess, would have liked to stay home rather than going to war like their wives in the first place).

Heads of State who are elected would have to perform the same duty, for similar costs, without the history or mystique. They bring continuity.. stability, and from what I’ve seen they do quite a bit for charity and the like.

This is of course just one persons perspective... and it can be difficult to put words to a “feeling” about an institution, but...

It’s almost like being near living history to me. An old lineage of a ruling/reigning family that goes back so far into the past but yet is still living and breathing in the present. Certainly Charles would have some big shoes to fill.. but I don’t think it would be much different. He is the next step in that line.. albeit certainly less popular. William seems like a fine man as well.

If they were disbanded and it was just an elected head of state.. that historical mystique wouldn’t be there for me. It would just be like the WH or somewhere else... just a placeholder home for the next buffoon elected.

Of course the buildings would still have history, and no I don’t think I’m going to meet her (unless she’s offering 😉), but it did add an aura that I cannot fully explain.

To my mind, the Queen is that connection to your past, and has a dignity and honor that we simply won’t find in a politician. Also from an outsiders perspective: they are able to focus on giving back to the community and representing you abroad, rather than be campaigning for half of their term.

The Monarch in a Parliamentary system doesn’t abuse power, being that she/he has no real government power. What exactly would an elected head of state do in that case? Would you just prefer to elect a Labour or Con politician to fill that role? Just to hold state dinners, open parliament, and go represent you abroad? At least Elizabeth II is non political.. do you really think having a politician would strengthen that role?

Do you mean **Wicker** park? Because that’s in the city. It’s a residential neighborhood (amd a fancy one, at that... one of the MOST expensive), not the financial district/downtowns.

Way back in CoS when peeps were judging him for being a parseltongue, he was not ever having any of their shit and would call them out! Even he, Ron, and Hermione had frequent rows about whatever dumb shit they were off on another one about at any given time. And he also constantly did violent and reckless shit that put others in mortal danger either inadvertently or very often purposefully! I’m just not sure how you came to this conclusion.

Like either Harry would be in trouble for being a witness or a potential suspect of Cedric's murder or if they never found his corpse, they would've straight up asked him about why Cedric is missing.
If Hogwarts wouldn't ask, the ministery or the parents would.
It would have helped Harry as leverage against literally everyone who doubted him. 
There aren't many sources he could've died from outside the labyrinth itself (at which point Hogwarts would get in major trouble). 

That reminds me: Dobby got Harry suspended because magic has been used near Harry. So the ministery can detect magic but not its origin? And doesn't think that The Boy Who Lived™ might have some people trying to set him up?

s11mq5,"I think destroying dumbledore’s office is fair lol 😂. That dude ghosted Harry for the entire season and didn’t address Harry’s rightful PTSD and frustration. Harry is angsty af, but not without reason and as anything, it would’ve been helpful to have a therapist to help Harry process the sheer amount of pressure that fell on him. His friends did their best, and even Ginny tried to relate to him with her own trauma. But the whole book is the culmination of the adults in charge of him not getting him the help he needed and allowing him to spiral out of control. Dumbledore seriously chose to allow Harry’s least favorite teacher to teach him how to protect his mind and did a pikachu face when Harry clearly didn’t learn enough and was easily manipulated. So…I’m kind of flipping my opinion on OOTP. While I think Harry is completely spiraling, no adult helped him process the feelings of grief and ptsd. They kept leaving him to feel he wasn’t being included and that’s the opposite of what you do to someone who’s just experienced trauma. And he’s also being presented with clear evidence to start distrusting the government and the school system he spent 4 years trusting. He deserved to be talked to and he wasn’t. Dumbledore’s the ass here. Harry definitely needed so much help and he just allowed him to spiral.",2022-01-11 15:15:48

The iPhone 6+ on the other hand is still supported by Apple and runs the latest version of iOS. But, as we all now know, if you’re 6+ is slowing down, get that new battery 😉",2017-12-24 02:30:32

Vs you know, just being sad, a normal emotion people go through. Just think of people who say they have OCD simply because they like this one part of their life to be neat and that's it.

Now both the bank and the cafe are closed. I know my little tradition wasn't keeping a Chase Bank and a little family restaurant in business. 
I do know making things all around ""faster"" and ""easier"" for many more people than myself surely didn't help keep those businesses open and people employed.

9nnxiz,"That's what I did yesterday. I have music in my ears about 80% of the time when I'm out and about (and at home actually), but every now and then I put the earphones away and connect with the space/sounds around me without the music. It's a good exercise in clearing the fog that comes with the near constant presence of tech in my everyday life. 

Sure it's wonderful to have the ability to shape the soundtrack of my surroundings with all this music, deciding what the world feels like, altering the tone of my day (it's an invaluable gift that I wouldn't trade for anything), but it distances you from a lot of things, and it's important to reset and bring yourself back out of the clouds and onto the ground every so often. 

I find the music often alters my perception of the passage of time and distance (again, sometimes a good thing), and switching it off brings that back to a more natural place. The same goes for more or less everything on your phone, but I don't have to remind anyone off that. I'm sure *everyone* is aware of it in some way, due to the constant reminders and PSAs we get telling us we're turning ourselves into cabbages. It's easy to ignore them and carry on floating around in the bubble (✋️guilty), but they have a point. 

It's been said a million times before, but it really is *immeasurably* important to pay attention to how these things alter your perceptions and make moves to reset back to default every now and then. I don't do it as much as I should. 

This was an unintentionally long and preachy reply, but it needs to be said. I hope you find more quiet resetting time in the future :)",2018-10-13 09:28:47

The only time I didn’t feel bad for teachers was while I was in college. If the professor is going to assign huge readings every night and projects with detailed outlines and expectations that would take hours upon hours of work then I expect them to spend just as much time being able to teach it back to us and on grading the projects thoroughly. It was always funny to me when a professor would have strict due dates for detailed papers/projects and also include the date they’d give grades back. Grades & feedback were always 1-2 weeks late lmfao",2018-06-01 03:37:10

hhxan7,"Every body here is saying that it's better to wake up from a good dream but I don't think they've experience heavy depression (if y'all have I apologise for jumping to conclusions).

Whenever I have a really good dream, it's because I'm actually happy in it, and it's usually just some normal stuff going on like going to work or hanging out with friends, but I'm ACTUALLY happy and not weighed down with constant dark thoughts, worried, and an overall feeling of numbness.

Then when I wake up from those dreams, it sends me further deep into the depression for a few hours, to days, to even a week or two because I know I'll never actually be happy like that ever.

I honestly don't really have nightmares, and if I do I either don't remember them, or my own nightmares are tamer than my own thoughts that I don't view them as nightmares🙃",2020-06-29 17:20:54

c7ncbu,"🤔 Is this true? (I don’t doubt you really, it’s just what I say when something seems to be untrue.) I guess it’s like the metric versus imperial systems. It’s actually easy/easier to use the metric, but far too many people in the US — myself included — are too used to the imperial, so it’ll likely never be changed.",2019-07-01 08:12:34

c7ncbu,"Thank you for the conversion. 👍🏻 I could’ve figured it up myself, but I was too lazy right now. 😒 

If you do go, make sure you visit Bayern, around Munich, like the smaller towns. I think you’ll really enjoy it there. It’s a lot less “hustle & bustle” (like Berlin, for instance), people are a _lot_ friendlier (my experience, anyway), and you could still very likely get a lot done. Think of it as a hideaway town, where no one would expect to see ya, but there you are. Oh! And the small towns’ celebrations of Oktoberfest really is amazing, too! 😂",2019-07-01 08:17:37

This is possibly going to come across as dickish, and I'm not even sure why I really want to respond, but here we are. 🤷‍♂️

I think it's because although it seems like such a small thing, it can change your life.  Not just the ""getting to sleep on time"" thing, but learning to do that.  It sounds like it's something you both really want to do, but can't.  I just want to encourage you to *do it*.

I'ma give you the steps on how to do the thing.  You may have to adapt and fill in the blanks.

1:  Do it.

Jokes aside, this is now a project.  Projects require planning, execution, ongoing adjustments, and finally, results.

Go to bed on time.  When it doesn't work, and you can't get to sleep, figure out why.  Get to the bottom of the problem.  Do you feel restless?  Not tired?  Feel like you are missing out?  Figure out the answers to those questions, then ask the next question, ""how do I change that?"".  Maybe calm down with some tea before bed.  Maybe plan to do something awesome in the morning so you have to sleep now.  And then once you've solved that problem, bingo!  You're sleeping early!  

Just kidding.  Then you'll have another problem to solve...  So, think about it.  Research the problem.  Find solutions to the problem.  Then you get to sleep on time?  Prolly not.  Likely, you find another problem, and have to solve that. 

And then one magic day, you'll have solved all the problems, and you'll get to sleep on time.  And then something else comes and fucks it up, and you have to solve that.  And maybe you'll sleep well for a while. 

Now, this isn't about sleep at all.  The sleep is just the current target.  With this project, you will have learned some very important life skills.  You'll learn how to problem solve, how to research, how to apply information.

Most of all though, you will have shown yourself that you DO have control over yourself.  You can take control of your life and make it what you want it to be.  Through sheer force of will and determination, you will have given yourself the power to sculpt who you are, to manifest yourself as you wish to be. 

Sleep tight <3",2020-06-08 22:54:06

I actually don't : the school I work for today has by far extended schedules than what I knew in high school and college - I mean, I used to start at 8 or 10 AM, for 6 hours of courses; now my students have to stay sometimes 9 courses (9x45min) a day. They are difficult teenagers with learning troubles and socieconomical issues... wonder why everybody hate our schedule 😁

I'm also making a call to underpaid teachers od the world to land a job in public schools here in Switzerland : the pay starts generaly at the mean revenue, and yes, you're paid 13 times a year. And our schools arent the worst in the world.",2019-01-09 06:34:48

79mzvn,"Breakdowns are internal for me, I don't let even myself see that shit ever since my older brother by three years died when I was 15. 2017 has been especially bad for me. Things just don't come in three's for me, it's typically three sets of three. This has been a year of a massive family betrayals, heart shattering cold shoulder, followed by family death, death, father potentially going to spend the rest of his life behind bars, self defense in which I nearly Kai'd a man with a tire knocker death, suicide in my bathroom by gun and having to clean it up, follow that with the death of a very close friend from a brain tumor within two months of diagnosis. Have never felt more alone and I can't talk about it in person, it gets me no where and drives me to drink. The only thing that has ever helped is talking to complete strangers, usually online.

How can i top 2017 off with a cherry atop a hot piping plate of freshly squeezed excrement served by Life?

j4lrjs,"What I'm running into now at 32 is that I'm weak! I've been skinny my whole life, never had to work out, and now I can't do a single pushup and I get winded going up 3 flights of stairs. And you're right, old habits die hard. And because I never had to work out I'm self conscious about starting to, it feels weird and silly and I get embarrassed. 😅 I wish I had formed healthy habits much earlier in life!",2020-10-03 23:47:22

Recently I had health issues and I had to stop working out. I lost most of the muscle mass and am skinny-ish again, but have gained a bit of fat around the belly, love handles and cheeks (on my face 😜). It’s the first time in my life I haven’t had visible abs! I definitely need to start eating habits now to avoid looking pregnant like my dad.",2020-10-04 00:28:05

I went literally years where I was eating fast food every day at work and at one point I was doing a honey bun and 44oz Mt Dew for breakfast. I was told I was probably thin but really unhealthy but I do yearly physicals and blood work that's required for my job and I'm always in good ranges.

Who knows, maybe one day but that day ain't anytime soon it seems 😂",2020-10-04 00:53:31

j4lrjs,🤯 this is my problem,2020-10-04 09:02:16

Many people with my illness work part time or don’t work at all, but others just get on with it. I was only 19 when diagnosed so I get on with it. OF COURSE I decided dog walking was a fantastic job for someone with (light) chronic pain! 😂 It is a fantastic career for someone who can’t be around other people due to low immunity though! I don’t complain, but some days it’s obvious I’m not well and I have customers who pick up on it. They don’t realise I’m in pain though because I don’t talk about it much. 

My family don’t realise how much pain I’m in and downplay it. They also get frustrated with me when I can’t go on anymore. 

My husband has Crohn’s disease (I know right, what a pair!) and is often in agony. I do get very frustrated when he goes days in pain because it gets in the way of life, and I can just keep going, and when I remember how he must be feeling, there’s a bit of guilt there.",2019-12-23 09:41:05

I still get very sick from eating and I know I shouldn’t always do it, but sometimes it’s worth it to get sick to be able to have tastes of things. (I don’t do this often, but when I do I always get comments about it). I also drain my stomach with one of my tubes quite often and people ask me “is that allowed?” Like yes! My doctor suggested it as a way to avoid the vomiting. I hate how nosey some people can be and how if my weight looks fine or I take a bite of food, then I must not need my tubes. I don’t wanna need them and I try to hide them well under my clothes, but that’s just my current reality.

The only sure fire way to fix it is to get in there and do something called a Microvascular Decompression surgery where they go in and remove anything touching the nerve itself and then chemically ablate it to ensure it stops causing so much pain.

eeeccm,"Do you have anxiety, or are you a teeth clencher? I didn't realise I clenched when I was stressed, also turns out I night clench.

Result was years of debilitating stress headache that would sometimes go away, but usually continuous. Also a migraine sufferer from 5 years old so I knew the difference.

Other symptoms were wobbly/sensitive teeth, compromised sleep, growth of mandibular Tori, and development of TMJ/TMD. 

Now I sleep with a mouthguard in, don't chew gum/eat crusty bread, and do jaw massages when I get headaches. Been mostly headache free (from the daily debilitating tension headaches anyway) for 4 years, but they can come back quickly if I irritate my jaw.

If none of this applies I'm sorry for the essay. Also feel free to ask more if it sounds familiar. These conditions are awful and it saddens me that others have to go through them as well

These diagnosis work on exclusion, you have X set of symptoms but we can't figure out what's wrong so we dump you in a basket of don't know and call it fibromyalgia/CFS.
For me it means that I am 48hour-no-sleep exhausted, pretty much all the time. I'm 26, I'm physically fit, I exercise to keep my body as well as I can but there are days where I use a walking stick because I'm in too much pain. It's been like this for a decade.
Maybe it is pyschosematic but so is the placebo effect and we know that works, whether it is a mental illness or physical (the weight of evidence suggests it's most likely physical but so much is unknown that it might be a mix or either) doesn't really matter. Trying harder isn't going to stop me being suddenly out of breath for no reason when I've walked up a flight of stairs despite being fine the previous hour.

I (female) went to one of those to get a cheap, sleazy-looking sex toy for a friends birthday cake and the men in there seemed terrified to see me. I felt really bad for them, as I was kind of invading their safe space.

In sharp contrast to those more traditional sex shops are female owned and operated sex shops. Those places are great fun. Women are all like “Oh I have one of those, you’ll love it! You can wash it in the dishwasher!” 🤣",2022-04-19 00:02:40

u6k7fj,"This is true, but it's also true there'd be a lot more theft if this existed.

When I managed a sex toy store an actual crackhead stole an expensive bondage kit while I was training a new employee. We were watching him as he shoved it awkwardly in his parka on that warm spring night, then he fled when I called him out for stealing. Pretty sure he sold that on the street to fuel his addiction.

What others have written is true, I never cared about what people were getting. I only cared that they got what they wanted and that they'd be hella satisfied (😏😏) with their purchase.

I found that women were more likely to chat with me about their wants and needs (I'm a woman), and men typically avoided looking in my direction and would literally throw money on the counter to try to get outta there asap bc they were so nervous. If a male colleague was working, women would rarely go in the store and men would usually come in acting like ""tough guys."" Few people were ever legitimately comfortable with just browsing, let alone actually buying stuff.

Like, honestly, there's no shame in celebrating your sexuality, and eff anyone who says otherwise. You ""do"" you!!",2022-04-19 12:55:41

ayaipf,"I remember I went with a group of people and me being the only one under 21 I had to stay outside the bars. I would occasionally walk away and meander. 

Eventually, the entire group went to different bars and I was by myself. I didn't want to stay and do fuck all so I started walking around. One of them calls me and tells me where he is but I have no idea where I am. I see a bright neon sign and attempt to read it, but can't, bad eyes and I'm on acid.

I walk up to this girl and ask her to read the sign to me. As soon as I said anything to the girl her bf walked up to me with his chest puffed out acting like he was going to fight me. He gets in my face and asks what I'm doing talking to his gf. I tell him my predicament and he then turns into the nicest person, it was like a light switch. 

He introduces me to his group of friends and then tells me I'm going to hang out with them until my friends come get me. That's cool, these people seem nice. Then they tell me were leaving and I say Nah. He then grabs my arm and starts pulling me. I'm trying to get away from him but his gfs friend comes up and tells me that I can trust them, two of them are nurses. I reluctantly walk with them towards the Uber. Mid walk they tell me they need to search me and I'm like Nah again. 

I finally agree to the search but on my conditions, I was holding every important thing in my hand while they went through my bag, and patted my person down. The moment the pat down ended the ube showed up and we headed towards it. Before I got in I saw a minimart and asked if anyone wanted anything, they all said no and let me leave. I walk into the store and the security guard tells me to leave all my stuff at the front or I wouldn't be able to shop.

I leave my shit and walk around for a bit and finally get a call from my friends asking where I am. When I leave the store I see the people waiting for me so I had to walk a completely different way back just to find a friend of mine in a sea of people. 

Scariest night I've ever had, but it was pretty gnarly 🤙

It was a thing. The teachers knew, the front office knew, but subs didn't seem to care. 

If I had a substitute teacher that day, they would force me to go to the office and get a late slip.

My brother was going to feed him to the snake next since he was clearly not going to make it long.

I convinced my bro to let me take him instead and try to save him. I honestly didn't think I could bring him back let alone get him healthy enough to live past a few days, but he made it and I spoiled him rotten his whole life ((: Now he has a tiny tombstone and final resting place under a tree in my family's yard so he's never forgotten ❤️",2018-05-11 21:38:51

i9btvp,"In the time period in which the film is set, sixteen was actually a pretty normal age for girls to get married--if we're arguing period-accuracy. Also, Ariel fought hard to be with Eric... it's not like she was forced into it or groomed from an early age. Quite the opposite, actually.

If you really want to modernize it though, this movie was targeted toward very young children, who likely don't even think about the mechanics of relationships yet. Most young girls don't even notice that particular detail--16 is so far off in their minds; most kids see older teenagers as equivalent to adults. I highly doubt any actual 16 year old would use The Little Mermaid as an arguing point to elope, and I doubt Disney was pushing for an increase in teenage marriages😄 Some things you just gotta let go. Kids watch disney for strong-willed women, good animation, and catchy songs. It's only us adults that notice the other stuff, and in this case--of a consensual relationship, mind you--there really isn't a problem worth banning a movie over. (Also Eric is only 18, so there's not even a creepy age difference.)

Side note: The Little Mermaid was my favorite movie as a kid, and I grew up to be a 20-something, unmarried, Lesbian, so I doubt Disney's influence is really THAT high lmao😂🤣🤣

sgmqpr,"I never realised how bad the US has it, Jesus Christ.

Ok so for reference I'm from Switzerland 🇨🇭, we're below Germany, above Italy. NOT SWEDEN WE DIDN'T MAKE IKEA

I used [this](https://www.in2013dollars.com/) website to calculate inflation, for both currencies.

$100 in 1990 is (...) about $213.31 today, an increase of $113.31 over 32 years.
The dollar had an average inflation rate of *2.40%* per year between 1990 and today, producing a cumulative price increase of *113.31%*.

100 Fr. in 1990 is (...) about 128.65 Fr. today, an increase of 28.65 Fr. over 32 years.
The Swiss Franc had an average inflation rate of *0.79%* per year between 1990 and today, producing a cumulative price increase of *28.65%*.

Now while economists might say ~ 2% inflation is good for the economy, that's only if wages rise to match it.

[The numbers below](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-median-income?country=OWID_WRL~USA~CHE) are international-$ and adjusted for inflation to be comparable:
US median daily household income 1990: $44.62
US median daily household income 2019: $57.21
**+28% increase** 

CH median daily household income 1990: $52.78
CH median daily household income 2019: $58.08
**+10% increase**

So everyone is earning more, inflation by itself isn't the issue, the real issue here is [the price of goods and services.](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/price-changes-in-consumer-goods-and-services-in-the-usa-1997-2017?time=earliest..2017&country=~USA)

Where **essential goods and services** like education, have increased by more than the inflation rate making them more expensive in absolute values.",2022-01-31 09:51:25

Fun fact: they’re also housed in sex-segregated dorms, and pre-marital sex is a HUGE scandal, so marriage of like 15 and 16 year olds is fairly common so couples can sleep in (and have sex in) the same rooms “legally”.

The org is totally cool with these underage marriages, but NOT cool with them taking time off to get married.  So they have their weddings at like 11pm.  There were many nights I was doing up-do’s and wedding manicures at like 9-10pm at the salon and then they’d rush over a couple blocks to the Ft. Harrison hotel (huge antique hotel owned by Scientology) for the wedding. 

I got to go in that hotel twice as a guest of the Scientologist owner of the place I worked.  It was like walking onto the fancy decks of the fucking titanic.  After seeing that place from the inside it’s obvious why they have to charge members so much to progress up the bridge 😂

awg2kw,"THIS 🙌

Actually having OCD is torture and not something cool or quirky. It’s exhausting. ",2019-03-02 18:57:49
awg2kw,Real OCD is when you have a mental breakdown over a leaf on the floor👌,2019-03-02 22:09:15
awg2kw,I hate when people say “my ocd is kicking in” ...... it’s ok to want things a certain way without claiming a disorder 🙄,2019-03-02 23:13:54
awg2kw,"Tell that to my aunt🙄 I can’t stand to watch tv any other way except me sitting directly in the middle of it. If I walk a certain way and then decide to walk to opposite direction, if it doesn’t feel right... or makes me feel “ dirty “ I have to correct what I’m doing.. like that dirty feeling when you look at a ton of holes in a uniform pattern or whatever. ... anyways I don’t have it. ",2019-03-03 01:37:19
awg2kw,*CDO (so it's in alphabetical order) 😘💕,2019-03-02 18:37:47
awg2kw,"I had a college roommate who acted like she had ocd because I once shut MY Clorox wipes into the lid and didn’t really care.  She then fixed it and claimed OCD. 

Now, why do I say “acted”, you ask?

She later proceeded to drop whole bars of soap into the shower and left them in the drain, never picked them up 

She left pubic hair all over the LID of the toilet. As if she sat on top of it and shaved. 

Dumped ALL of my toilet cleaner in the sink to try and clean the sink instead of using her cleaner, left a gross purple stain everywhere. 

Proceeded to leave food out on the stove for days and then act like it was mine. 

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. I ended up having to move because she was constantly picking at my stuff/on me for not being meticulous (I am very clean but not “ocd” in her terms; I do not have OCD) and would also blame me for everything she did. 

But yeah. I’ve had quite a few roommates who have claimed OCD just so they could touch my stuff and claim a mental illness so they could seemingly get away with it. Additionally one of them claimed to have cervical cancer when she had cramps, then claimed breast cancer when she felt a twinge in her boob. So I guess to them it really is OCD 🤷🏻‍♀️😂",2019-03-02 14:14:18
awg2kw,Still gonna say “it gives me OCD attacks” every time I see something slightly off”🤷🏼‍♂️,2019-03-02 19:59:34
awg2kw,Do you think if I write something and then erase and rewrite it 4-5 times would be *veeeeryy* slight ocd? I also hate it when things aren’t properly aligned. Not trying to offend you or anything if it comes across that way 👍,2019-03-02 17:32:47

awg2kw,This makes me so happy.  I've struggled with anxiety and depression and have been working to improve it and have improved a lot with it lately as well.  And while it is not the same as your OCD I'm sure the feeling of having your mental illness loosen its grip on your life is very similar.  I'm rooting for you and hope that you live your best life! Good luck with your journey to an easier life ❤️,2019-03-02 16:09:52
awg2kw,"Right. I’d assumed that everyone tended to obsess over them to an extent too, because they’re not normal and what does it say about you that you’re having them, etc., but after heading to google I found that is not the case & that they can associated with a number of disorders. I also found that not everyone is convinced their loved ones are dead when they’re not home at the exact time you expect them to be, and that those are also intrusive thoughts. The more you know. 🤷🏼‍♀️ ",2019-03-02 15:43:02

9tpcdy,"My take on this is its a way to describe making love. Let's break it down:

- The three points are mouth, hands and groin

- the two lines are the lines between these points, so each person forms a triangle 

- but also the lines between himself and his lover's three points of *their* triangle. 

- therefore, ""three points where two lines meet"" is about joining those three points with your lover, eg. kissing, holding hands.. 

- ""let's tessellate"" is therefore about two triangles joined together. 😘😘😘",2018-11-03 04:43:24

9tpcdy,According to the detailed description it is supposed to be a “hopeless suiter” scenario. The picture associated with it is actually a kid trying to give a rose to megan fox while she is looking away holding another dudes hand so I guess I was actually kind of right 😂,2018-11-03 07:10:01
9tpcdy,☝️☝️ This one tessellates!! 😅😉😅,2018-11-03 07:25:04
9tpcdy,"The letter ""V"" is a broken triangle🔺, because two of the points aren't attracted to each other.  A *love* triangle refers to each point being attracted to each other.  The attraction between two points are shown as lines, like the sides of a V, and not the triangle.
OP pointed out the triangle has a line where one shouldn't be located. This non-line makes the triangle look like the 22th letter of the English alphabet.

Edit: changed letter number",2018-11-03 05:03:34

8vm9qn,"Its not an unreasonable thought, because if you think about it if there has ever been a civilization so advanced as to create a simulation of civilization itself, then why would they not run them trillions of times with every possible scenario?

 Maybe then the question is not whether we are in a simulation, because if civilization and conciousness can indeed.be simulated and have been then the overwhelming chances are that we are in one. So maybe you're right...

uzocwi,"Actually did this unintentionally. We live in the South. Wanted our youngest to experience her first white Christmas and all that. She’s never seen snow. So i booked a incredible suite at Crystal mountain in Michigan. The area gets incredible amounts of snow. Looked awesome. We get there. Didn’t rent a car. Because we usually Uber on vacation. Come to find out. Uber and ride share are almost nonexistent. 🥹 and i said sure that’s ok. We can get there. The resort has multiple restaurants, etc,etc. We’ll be fine. No biggie. 😆 that was my second mistake. We get to this beautiful winter wonderland. And come to find signs everywhere. No hiking, no sledding, no s’mores on fire. And only one restaurant open. The “Thistle”. Which is now a on going joke in the house. Because we ate every meal there for a week. Total population of surrounding 25 miles. 4,000 people. Mind you. The resort website mentioned none of this. We were so happy to be home. We actually jumped for joy when we got off the plane in 85 degree sunshine. Ahh home. Fuck that place. No sledding. No skiing. No s’mores. No hot chocolate. No snowman.",2022-05-28 19:07:56

I find the micro-level behavioral decisions that we make 100s of times during the span of a day fascinating, as well as the difference between how different people interpret and make those decisions. It's situational. Factual questions that can be easily answered, more often than not, yes. But... Will that question spark a different discussion with the person you are asking? Is that what you are looking for? Are you able to read that person enough to know if this is a good time to ask them a trivial question? How will they react? Is there value in me looking this up myself?

And then, what if it is a gray area? I Google and find conflicting answers. Do I ask then, or keep researching? It has as much to do with knowing how to search as it does with knowing how to read people and understand them.

uhdv93,"🤓 Actually, the type of symbiotic relationship that is had here depends on what the mermaid gains from this relationship. The mermaid doesn't strictly benefit from this relation in any meaningful way so it is likely not mutalism. If the mermaid were unaffected by this relationship then this could be considered commensalim, however as the starfish is actively taking in nutrition from the teat of the mermaid and depriving it of its own resources this is more likely to be a fairly parasitic relationship. Whether or not the host is significantly harmed due to the presence of the parasite is however at this moment unknown.",2022-05-04 02:39:12

uhdv93,"All the people I’ve known who went to dental school also worked in research labs (I worked with them) and had undergraduate degrees in the sciences. The University of Washing school of dentistry publishes tons of research articles 🤷‍♂️

Also I’m pretty sure being published is just a common medical school requirement, not a licensing requirement or anything. My own father was a pathologist for 30 years before he passed away in the 90’s. He worked in nuclear medicine research because he had a physics undergrad background.. pretty sure the closest he ever got to being recognized for his contributions was being listed as “et al”, if even that. Though I realize the research requirements have been growing and growing over the years (free labor for PI’s and all)

I would argue that medicine is very much a solidly science backed and skillful art. But practicing medicine is not an execution of the scientific method. Too much relying on an educated judgment, but judgement none the less, is involved for that.

Edit: of course lots of physicians are intimately involved in biomedical research! But that doesn’t make practicing medicine itself outside of participating in research studies anything other than an educated judgement (yes educated by volumes of scientific research and professional experience)",2022-05-03 19:12:27

He was still being pervy, but the only other Pervy thing I know of is him having her wear the metal bikini. And making Natalie Portman’s costume tear at her belly. Pretty mild in the spectrum of pervy directors. 

Certainly not anywhere near the level of Quentin Tarantino insisting that he be the one choking Uma Thurman with the chain in Kill Bill even though he’s not in that scene.

At least George Lucas let Carrie Fisher choke the slug that gave her the metal bikini 😅",2022-05-03 16:17:20
uhdv93,"Ah sorry, yeah I was totally agreeing with you. Practicing medicine can be done as part of scientific research (for example if your patients are enrolled in a research study), but otherwise the art of practicing medicine itself isn’t really science, more just applying their educated judgement. It’s the same with dentistry, science guided but practicing in the profession generally isn’t science 👍🏻",2022-05-03 21:59:22

I'm sure it's actually a delicacy. The vampires would worship such a monthly cycle. An autotrophic system of self feeding. A male vampire could get a feeding while going down on is wife.

g6gtyf,"It's easy to develop an easily defined skill. Want to get better at archery? Well first you put a lot of hours into it, although it is also valuable to research or think about various ways to use those hours more efficiently. Improving is more than just time spent, it's also the efficiency of that time which ultimately decide not only the improvement rate, but also the total possible improvement you can see regardless of time.

&#x200B;

But it becomes more difficult when you want to develop a deeper sense of morality, or when you are dealing with subjects wherein your capability to 'put in hours' is dependent on your skill in the first place.. For instance leadership, well it's hard to put in a lot of hours to get good at leadership, if the people you lead all leave because you suck at leadership. And evolving a sense of morality, or something along those lines, has very little to do with repitition (How do you do a planned repitition of moral good?) and has much more to do with educating yourself, being introspective and observant about the world around you.

And would you price things as 1.55788 gigadollars? Or 1 gigadollar, 557 megadollars, 880 kilofollars? 

Maybe a better solution, is first to revalue the dollar so that 10 dollars = 1 new dollar. And have 1000 cents = 1 dollar. Of course it shouldn't be a cent, but a mille? Please help me with Latin someone. That way you could carry a 25 mille coin and it would be worth the equivalent of $2.50 today. We'd have coins that are worth something again.

And a 250 mille coin would be worth $25 today. I wish coins could be worth what they were 120 years ago relative to GDP per capita. 

Since units jump by 10^3 in science, doing it with coins would be so much more consistent. And this idea would be a mini version of what the OP proposed. Yay!

Also, I do wish we had a $1,000 bill, a $10,000 bill, a $100,000 bill, and a $1,000,000 bill. Bills haven't even kept up with inflation, let along GDP. And I know lots of people don't like cash. But like it! I would love to hold a $1,000,000 bill in my hand. 😁",2019-10-12 20:07:26

5v4b0c,"I' ve seen those memes on FB.  I don't think they mean that the person who posted it finds seatbelts, helmets etc unnecessary.  But sometimes there is such a strong focus on things like...let's say hand sanitizer.  A great product and very convenient to be sure.  But soap and water works great too.  I can't tell you how many times I have heard people bitch and moan about no hand sanitizer in a public restroom or even in someone's home, just soap.  A friend admonished me for not making my kids wear knee and elbow pads while riding their bikes.  I didn't see a need for it but she said that cyclists in events like the tour du France wear them so.....  If my kids had been riding through the Alps at high speeds then maybe I would have agreed.

My kids were born in '92 and '94. We always use seatbelts.  They wore bike helmets.  We baby-proofed our houses.  But we weren't so afraid of them getting sick or injured that we took every precaution known to man.  There are 'some' parents who do and that is their choice.  Me?  I think a scraped knee or elbow can help kids learn to avoid certain behaviors and having the common cold and being exposed to the mild illnesses of others helps build immuity.

For the most part, advances in technology and a better understanding of certain illnesses are better for us.  Maybe those posting the memes should simply be happy they made it to adulthood and embrace modern things that make us safer and healthier.

If we actually played at 110% of our ability, we would literally die of exhaustion.

ei3bsh,"How exciting to start at the beginning! It can be overwhelming with the amount of options out there. If you’re not yet ready to invest in a bunch of new games or a new system, there’s a lot of great PC games out there. The Steam app has a wide selection of excellent free and low-cost games. Since you’re a brand new gamer, point-and-click games or puzzle games might be a good place to start. The mechanics aren’t heavy but these games often have immersive story lines. Personally, I started with the Myst games years ago, which combine these elements.

You could also find old school games online. PlayR, for example, features a bunch of old gameboy games. 

If you do want to get a game system now, Nintendo Switch would make a great choice. It has a wide variety of games for you to try out, and the portability is a nice addition. Any game with Mario in it would probably make a good introduction. These include things like Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart, and Luigi’s Mansion. I also really enjoyed Yonder, which is a nice intro to open world style games without combat. It also makes a great precursor to Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which I’m currently LOVING.

Most importantly, try out what *you* find interesting. The more you’re interested in it, the more likely you are to immerse yourself.

And just in case no one has added this, I’d recommend checking out r/girlgamers as I’m sure the lovely ladies there would be happy to help! You’re also always welcome to message me if you want to chat gaming 🙂",2019-12-31 19:14:15

Getting physical with everyone is really overrated. I now know that I just want to eventually find the right person, then being physical will be so much more fulfilling and beautiful. You'll be ok 😊

khbns3,"Worked in restaurants all my life and have found the opposite to be true. I'm a real eat the rich leftist but the honest truth is that class goes up, so does generosity and ease of service. They are less demanding, make less crazy modification requests, and are much easier to get a 30-50%tip out of, whereas there are many lower class people who simply can't afford to dine out, do so anyways, and decide to save money by screwing over the server. They also spend less overall on their meals. 20% of a 30 dollar meal is a pittance compared to 15% on 150, though I get stiffed or under tipped far less frequently working in fine dining and serving the rich almost exclusively. When poor people come in, they end up with sticker shock, get the cheapest stuff possible, and still frequently under tip. Who knows, maybe my area is some crazy outlier but I've been doing this 10 years and would never go back to serving primarily poor people in a million years if I want my bills to be paid.  
  
Now there IS a generational gap. Boomers of any income class are the shittiest tippers out there, and late 20s to early 30s millennial couples seem to be the most generous.

d4925n,That's one way to define `realistic` 😂,2019-09-15 00:59:26
d4925n,"> The language is still implausible. There are is still function words and vocabulary underlying the phrases they say, or they wouldn't be able to say that ""Tarmok and Jalad in Talaka"" or ""“Darmok and Jalad on the ocean"". So why not use those?

I think what you’re asking is, if Tamarians have words for *winter* and *ocean*, then why isn’t there a word like *mutual non-aggression pact*?

The situation strikes me as similar to the relationship between, say, English and American Sign Language.  ASL of course has signs for most concepts, but there is always the option to finger spell an English word using the signs for letters—but doing so is cumbersome and I would imagine not a native ASL user’s first instinct.

Finger-spelled words also don’t fit neatly into ASL grammar because they can’t be manipulated spatially.  For example, you could convey the idea of a tree falling by using the sign for tree (which starts out vertically) and tilting it until it’s horizontal—something you can’t do with the finger-spelled T-R-E-E.

It’s possible the Tamarians are uncomfortable with common nouns for grammatical or cultural reasons (note that aside from the language issue, the Tamarian captain had that ritual with the knife).

Where do these common nouns come from?  The Federation computer was able to recognize *Darmok* as a historical/mythological figure, so there might be some other species which has a relationship with the Tamarians and has lent them some of these words in the same way English lends finger-spelled words to ASL.

Why didn’t the Federation consult this hypothetical second culture when attempting contact with the Tamarians?  I suppose for the same reason they didn’t send Uhura or anyone with a linguistics background on the mission.  It’s possible the crew who encountered the Tamarians the first time noted that they were incomprehensible but didn’t note or didn’t understand why.  It’s also possible that second culture doesn’t exist anymore—perhaps they were wiped out during some kind of disaster or war.

Then and again...the Tamarians and the Federation didn’t meet by chance during the episode.  How did they arrange the meeting in the first place?  🤔

> If it has all the expressivity of human languages, how come they only use a dozen phrases over and over?

I think they might repeat the same phrases for the benefit of the TV audience, so that we can follow along once we understand how the Tamarian language works.  A less meta explanation might be that the Tamarians, aware of the communication problem, are intentionally limiting their phrases to ones they think the Federation will understand more easily.

> If all their language is references to stories, then how do they tell children those stories in the first place? Do they even need stories? Picard manages to figure it all out from context. After all he doesn't know the story of the beast at Tanagra and he's never seen the river Temarc in the winter.

You don’t need to know that Janus is the god of beginnings and endings to understand that January is the first month of the year.  Kids who grew up with smartphones don’t need to know that telephones used to literally hang on hooks to use the phrase *hang up*.  Language is full of stories from which words and phrases originate, but most words and phrases are learned through context.  When we remember these stories, they’re called etymologies; when we forget these stories, they’re called dead metaphors.

> So then doesn't the idea that they're metaphors falls flat? They really just function like normal words that happen to be very long, and no expressivity would be lost if ""Temba, his arms open"" was the one word ""take"", or ""Mirab, with sails unfurled"" was the one word ""go"".

I imagine the story the Tamarian chooses to invoke in his or her speech does express some information, like an accent or a level of formality.  You’d have a different impression of someone who says, “Take!” versus someone who says, “I’d like to offer you this” or “You should have this.”  We have plenty of different ways of phrasing the same idea which are functionally the same but very different in “expressivity”.  Maybe on the Tamarian version of reddit, they are wondering why Picard bothered with all that “mutual non-aggression pact” nonsense instead of using the equally expressive “let’s be friends” phrase.

They tried the same thing in my town and the city council listened to the bars owners and the council shot it down. Eventually that state passed the ban and won the argument. I have news for you, non-smokers die everyday too. I was a non-smoker for twenty-five years and the last night before the ban, I started smoking cuz fuck the government and Rob Reiner.

I was in Japan a few years ago and seriously shocked by the indoor smoking in some cafes. It smelled so bad that I had to abandon my coffee and leave one cafe and at another I was at in the ""non smoking section"" separated by a wall and it still stunk.

120qsve,"Sometimes I go in diners and bars where part of it smells like smoke, and it makes me nostalgic. 🥲

My mom used to say, ""Never date a guy who puts his cigs out in his food,"" and now I have to wait to find out. It kills me. (Also, never hand someone a pack without packing it, or a cigar without preparing it, don't throw cellophane on the floor, or the table, decant your cigarettes into a case and never leave lipstick on cigarettes or cups. Always carry a lighter. Using holders saves your fingers. Put out your cigarettes when the food arrives. Offer cigarettes and cigars with coffee. Smoke follows beauty. Always blow smoke up in a line. One ashtray for two people.) It's a whole education in itself.

When my mom was sick and I was single digits, she'd go for treatment for about six months, twice a week, chemo or radiation, and I'd hang out downstairs in the hospital lobby by the pharmacy, pay phones, vending machines, explore the stairs and the basement, feed squirrels for four hours or so. There was a group of about eight men that had no larnyxes, some had just holes and some had electronic voice boxes, playing cards and drinking coffee by the many vending machines.

They co opted me and would hang out with me, tell me all their stories. I thought it was great. Then they had to smoke outside, so they all moved outside and showed me how they smoke through the holes in their throats and tell me war tales. Fun times. My dad was high up and my mom, an opera singer, had what they thought was throat cancer, but all that went over my head and I just liked them. I won them over.",2023-03-24 20:44:04

Fast forward a few years: we take a trip to visit my grandma, who asks him what kind of cereal he wants her to buy for us to eat while we're there. He says something like, ""I sure wish they hadn't discontinued Cookie Crisp. That was my favorite cereal!""


Of course my grandma immediately says, ""When did they discontinue it? I saw it last time I went..."" And oh boy was I in the dog house 😅 It's a funny story now at least.


Edit: Y'all are mean 😂 Yes, he shops - we mostly shop at Aldi (off-brand cereal) and Food Lion. Without Cookie Crisp, there was no reason for him to go down the cereal/baking aisle. I am not a 50's housewife and he is not a himbo (mostly). In fact, I'd TOTALLY FORGOTTEN that I'd even said anything to him until the convo with my Grandma - I just didn't think it would stick in his head at all. The lie convo went something like:

Me: ""What do you want for breakfast this week?""

Him: ""Oh, I used to love Cookie Crisp as a kid! Get that?""

Me: ""....I didn't see it on shelves the last time I went. Maybe they discontinued it?""

18si7o2,"Fine dining is a little bit different than casual fare in a lot of ways though. Stiffing the server or tipping poorly is a pretty significant faux pas anywhere, but there are fewer ways to get through a meal without spending much when the menu all but prohibits it. In any situation, a good server wants to give the impression that the customer should enjoy the meal foremost, but that's not what pays their bills.

Upselling feels really sleazy, especially once you're the one doing it. Having been on both sides of this interaction, it's a 'rock and a hard place' thing. I really do commend a server who has the customer in mind first, as they're the ones who really deserve great tips, IMO. 🙂",2023-12-28 05:45:33

18si7o2,"Depends how you look it really. Sure $3.14 or whatever sounds bad but plenty of waiters in decent places can make $25-35/hour in tips even after tip out. While $15 or even $20 an hour sounds nice, if tipping stopped being the norm many servers would be plenty upset by it. And yeah anyone who's been a waiter knows that generally higher bill = higher tip = higher $ they take home, its not far fetched to see it as an unofficial commission job. 

Also accepting a tip/commission pay scale doesn't mean they should accept no employee benefits, these are two different issues entirely. Plenty of cashiers out there with hourly and no bennys.

18si7o2,">Soooo employees aren't entitled to a job?  🤨

Um, yes, that's correct. However, I submit that employees *should* be entitled to a living wage and a basic standard of living that includes health care, 401k and benefits that are fairly standard in white collar jobs. Edit to add: A ""living wage"" was the stated intent when the United States first instituted a minimum wage in 1938.

&#x200B;

>Also accepting a tip/commission pay scale doesn't mean they should accept no employee benefits, these are two different issues entirely.

I genuinely don't understand why anyone is making the assertion that servers and commission are somehow related. A commission is paid by the employer based on performance. Legally and otherwise, these are two completely separate types of payments in the US.

You're at least the second person I've seen draw a comparison between tipped workers and commission-based sales. I have absolutely no idea where that concept originated, but it is, at best, intellectually dishonest. At worst, it's intentionally misleading.

>Plenty of cashiers out there with hourly and no bennys.

1954b3k,"I’m autistic, and computers are my main special interest so, im bouta make the unexplainable explained. Photons (light particles/waves) are capable of interacting with many physical mediums, as all particles and waves do, so all you need is a photon sensor and an opposing LED, to generate a picture. Just a super advanced pinhole camera, basically. The more LEDs you have, the more accurate your image becomes. Transistors in-between the sensors and the LEDs (let’s call them pixels now that they’re digitized) transfer the electricity generated by the sensors (basically inverted LEDs, an LED receives energy and releases a photon, the sensors receive a photon and release energy) into what’s essentially a miniature readable capacitor bank, or what we call a SSD. This allows the image to be stored. We could do this with a HDD, much easier and cheaper, but not advantageous for a handheld device, so we’ll go with the more complex SSD. Logic gates, which can be thought of as a giant digital machine, can then modify said image by changing the amount of electricity stored in the drive. A logic gate can be thought of fairly simply using a medium like electromagnets. Think, one electromagnetic circuit can only be completed if another electromagnetic circuit is activated pushing a small metal leaf into place. This is an AND gate. Alternatively, the circuit can be completed by turning on one of two electromagnets, it doesn’t matter which turns on, either way it will push the metal into place allowing the circuit to activate, this is an OR gate. Using AND and OR gates, you can make all the rest of the gates, either just by logically working your way through them, or (if you’re willing to use existing infrastructure) looking up a chart online. Once the logic gates are made, doing binary math is fairly simple. An open gate is considered a 0, a closed gate is a 1. Want to add them together? Use an XOR gate. If either one of the gates is open, the answer is the opposite gate, if both are closed, the answer is 0, and we initiate a carry flag (which is just another logic gate, an AND gate this time). We do this math using transistors rather than electromagnets, but the idea is the same. Math is all you need to find all the data in your SSD, just increment the location you’re looking at by 1 and you’ll find the next image (or the next pixel, or the next letter, or whatever you’re looking for that’s saved sequentially). Want something that isn’t sequential? Easy, just use a hashing algorithm. By performing a known mathematical sequence on the binary, we get a consistent number for that piece of data, store the data in the drive at that location, and boom, we can access it near instantly. Now we have a lookup table. What if we don’t know the next data though, let’s just use a key system. Set a name for whatever the next image is (we call this name a variable) and now when looking for the image you just call it by its name, the logic gates hash the name, go to the spot in memory or SSD the name is stored, and increment by 1 to find the data. By reading and displaying the images back to back, we finally have our video. Now we just have to make the internet, so we can share that video. The internet is just a bunch of interconnected servers, so in order to make the internet, we really just need to create a server. A server is just a computer capable of interacting with other computers at a constant rate, so the base functions are the same as already described, which means we REALLY only have to worry about the interacting part. Phones usually use wireless communication, so you just need logic gates to pulse a long range wave generator at the right rate to send out the data, think of it as creating a sine wave where the tops of the waves are a 1, and the bottoms of the waves are a 0. By adjusting the frequency of the wave, but counting as if we didn’t adjust the frequency, we can send as many 1s or 0s as we please. Now, much like the LEDs, we can have an inverse sensor that accepts a wave and releases energy to read it back into the system. This can be done in both directions using an antenna, running electricity through copper wire generates a frequency, and running frequency through copper wire generates electricity, absolutely beautiful. This data can be transmitted even faster now by using fiber optic. A laser (just a highly precise photon shooter, basically) shoots through a cable made of directed fiber glass strands. This allows for laminar flow, a type of flow where all particles are going the same direction, and since the cable can be moved without impeding this flow, we can now direct laser light however we want, by rapidly turning on and off the laser (on being a 1 and off being a 0 (usually in multiple frequencies that will be split apart later for efficiency)) we can transmit our data across distances as long as the cables will go, for instance under the Atlantic Ocean where it will be attacked by angry sharks (the transatlantic cable). This allows us to send data across the world, wherever we want, just by building a system of cables stretching EVERYWHERE (kinda ruins the magic I know but there is a cable running from wherever you are, to wherever I am, that allows this data to get to each other). Now, we can put that picture onto someone else’s SSD and the picture (or series of pictures) you detected with your sensors can be read by someone else’s LEDs. Certainly not simple, but very explainable, insanely cool, and objectively beautiful. Human ingenuity truly knows no bounds.

1954b3k,"Pretty good and pretty accurate post! I wouldn’t say our eyes suck at their jobs, though. But you’ve stated some of their limitations pretty well. Comparing cameras to eyes is a common thing, but one is a living, growing, self healing organ capable of supplying our mind with 90%+ of the data we use on a daily basis to form our concept of reality; the other is, well, just a camera. Yes, the brain is what makes that information sensible to us, of course, but if you replaced your eyeballs with the best camera in the world you would be literally blind. My eyes have been cranking everyday for 41 years and have not missed a shot. I got hit in the eye with a piece of wood 20 years ago and the anterior chamber filled 80% with blood (hyphema) but my eye cleared out the blood and healed itself in a couple of weeks of bed rest and steroid eye drops. I’d like to see your fancy cameras do that 🤓. Can I make one small correction? Our retinas being upside down and backwards is irrelevant to anything in regards to quality and is definitely not our “blind spot”. Imagine taking a picture of something but having the camera upside down. Is the photo useless? Nope. You can just turn it around. Voila. Same quality. The blind spot you are referring to that we all have is experienced by all creatures with complex eyes like birds, mammals, etc. (there may be a rare exception… I haven’t studied every eye of every animal, curious where you got this information that other animals don’t have this?) and is caused by the optic nerve head being placed near the center of our vision and there being no retina overlying that spot. I liked your reference to the brain photoshopping the blind spot out. That’s a great description. Also, since we have two eyes, and the blind spots are in opposite spots, the fellow eye fills in the missing information.",2024-01-13 18:15:50
1954b3k,"The “true” answer here is that sensors (and film before them) require a certain amount of light before they will start “seeing” it.  There are 3 major things that can impact the amount of light making it to your sensor:  aperture, ISO, and shutter time.  The aperture is basically just how  big of a hole you have to look through.  The bigger the hole, the more light.  unfortunately a large aperture also means that you can’t focus on as much stuff.  If you see photos with “bokeh” (that blurry out-of-focus look of everything that isn’t the subject of the photo), that is what a wide aperture does.  Great for portraits, but terrible for astronomy.  The ISO is how sensitive your sensor or film is to the light.  Higher ISO means you get a picture faster but that picture is more likely to be grainy and have noise caused by other light sources and wavelengths that might not be in the visible range hitting it.  Finally shutter time is how much time your sensor or film is gathering the light for.  A longer shutter time (or “exposure”) means you get more light, but it also means your image will be more likely to blur from the camera shaking or things moving in frame.

If your photos are black (no stars), then you could try increasing any of those settings and it should help 👍🏼",2024-01-13 07:59:31
