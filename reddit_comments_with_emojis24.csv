gupyuy,Thanks for looking after your EU boys ❤️,2020-06-01 21:39:11
gupyuy,"Thank you for the uk/eu link. 

From an outsider (uk) it’s like the more you protest against the police, the worst it’s getting. 

There isn’t any middle line. 

I’m sorry for how frequently your country ends up in ‘civil unrest’. And yet nothing ever changes. 

The UK is much the same but on a smaller scale, we have brutality. We have a disgusting inbuilt amount of racism and factions. 

Not trying to cause a debate because what is happening is the most important thing- BLM, equality and foremost, ensuring an enduring change- but watching every video to come out of America, I’m glad our UK officers do not have guns, unless specially trained. 

Changes do need to made. So many ❤️",2020-06-01 22:21:59

13org0v,"Here in sweden.... I pay 20$ for visiting a hospital. 
If I would need to Come back for an MR or something... its again 20$ for that visit/treatment. And so on... If I need alot of treatment or have to see a doctor many Times during a year all medical stuff gets free above total 350$ or so.
If I would need a trip to ER... in an ambulance... its again 20$.

If I would get very sick and gets hospitalized... its 20$. 

Private insurance Will cover most of The workpay im missing out on.

In sweden we pay about 34% tax... and that covers amongst other things almost a free healthcare.
The healthcare system also makes insurance very affordable, i get very covered with mine i pay about 220$/year.

The thing is... everyone here pay taxes, everyone here pay fair taxes... meaning the rich pay same % or even higher taxes than the common folks.

Did i mention our system also covers free education and school lunches for all kids?

Medicine can be quite expensive tough... but I think we have a system for that too.... so If you need very expensive medicine for The rest of your life, it wont kill you finansially.

As I swede... I never worry about beeing able to afford education for my kids or face finacial ruin from medical issues.

13org0v,"I'm a mechanic at a shop that doesn't offer insurance, and marketplace policies were all close to the price of my mortgage.. 2 years ago I broke my hand and couldn't afford to get it fixed. Now I get to turn wrenches with a twisted hand until I (never) retire.. Woo 🎉😑🙃

Worst part is it happened off hours at work.. I should have claimed it was on work hours and got workmans comp.. This shit shop has already stolen tips (not expected anyway, but annoying still), and refused raises when I'm literally the second most reliable person who does all the bullshit work.. But #1 is the ownsers son, so nobody will ever measure up or deserve a raise..

 Yea, meritocracy with a ""healthy"" open market on the health and well beaing of of your population, specifically enacted at their expense, rather than for their benefit. Doing great USA...",2023-05-22 16:02:37

13org0v,"This astounds me. Today I took my youngest for a hospital physio appointment and later he had a milk tooth removed at the dentist. All I paid was 3 pounds for parking. Next month he has his second neuro ophthalmology appointment (has already had an MRI and lumbar puncture last month), cost me nothing as we got a lift to hospital and back. Over the years I’ve had 2 babies, viral meningitis and a couple of minor surgeries. Has cost me nothing- and I get paid time off work. I’m not ‘boasting’ I’m more angry that people who really need medical care can’t get it because of the cost 😢",2023-05-22 16:10:09

13org0v,Why do people live in America ? 😂,2023-05-22 16:41:42
13org0v,"The American system is built for corporations. The healthcare system is terrible, only doctors and insurance companies benefit from it. The labor laws are terrible, you have a painfully limited number of PTO, and unionisation is a massive mountain to climb. Your system is broken but your politicians have convinced you to care more about immigration issues than to band together and actually make a difference in your day to day lives. Good luck to the common folk of the USA 🙏",2023-05-22 16:46:38
13org0v,"Yup - one car accident and 27 X-rays later I'm -700k~ at least that's what it was at when i stopped looking. Partially collapsed a lung, cracked some ribs, tore a breathing tube, fucked my knees and shoulder up and they gave me a single ibuprofen the whole 24 hours I was there. That's it. That's all the pain relief I got. Been in pain ever since. Also - I was 5~ minutes from the emergency room when I crashed and the ambulance ran about 2k 💛",2023-05-22 16:50:12
13org0v,"Oh but those socialist countries with single payer healthcare have *taxes*, no one in the US pays those. 🙄 I try to point out that monthly insurance premiums alone are likely higher than most income taxes (excluding the highest earners), let alone having income taxes + insurance premiums. I make 55k and my entire tax draw for the month is ~1300. We get free at point of access healthcare, public education, subsidized daycare ($10/day) and more.",2023-05-22 14:08:31
13org0v," I had surgery to remove cancer a couple months ago. The bill ended up being twice what they'd estimated and far more than I'd budgeted for. 

When I called the hospital to see if they could work out a discount with me the lady on the phone literally had the audacity to say ""Your insurance covered part of it. You already got a discount.""

ubwjys,"To be in all fairness if he's a witness, also currently taking to stand meaning, he was rightfully attending mr.depp at the hospital, during the time of such events, being a witness and also aide to Mr.Depp, being told by the doctor about ""having an injury on one of his fingers"" is not hear say, that all depends on what Johnny said to the doctors about the wound, and of course in Mr. depp's defence prob won't say much, cowering in his defence being afraid to tell the truth afraid of what Amber might do next ...

Being a victim of Male domestic abuse/discrimination/physical/mental/verbal abuse..  It sucks 😔.. and it's not easy because these ... These woman who do this and who are like this, just... I don't even know, I'm not saying they don't deserve to be alive, but they don't deserve to be able to coward to justice system ""Acting"" as the ""Victim"" .. 

The sad part is more than half those woman who abuse men.. walk Scott free .. and that's not fair to us.. it's trau.atizing for the rest of our lives... In soo many ways people who don't go through abuse would just never be able relate or know how we feel.  I'm sure Mr.Depp has probably thought about suicide a few times during the relationship as sometimes that's what it leads us to 

Fortunately I myself and am out that position and am much happier in life and have a family happy and  healthy as can be and feels so refreshing.  

I hope Johnny wins..  courts really have to think to.. why would someone continue to fight back even after losing much of his career already, all she has is petty BS that basically she setup everytime to record or snap a pic of..
I just can't believe whoever the judge is believes that she's the victim here...

Who the hell loses a finger, but the other person doesn't have a scratch on them ?! She didn't and hadn't called the police or security, if he was so violent than why did you only record and never call or actually ""DO"" something about it.. rather than poking and antagonizing a sleeping bear ..

### What is the link between Dihydrogen Monoxide and gun violence?

📷The incidence of gun violence seems to be rising at an alarming rate. A recent stunning revelation is that in every single instance of violence involving guns, both in the U.S. and internationally, Dihydrogen Monoxide was involved. In fact, DHMO is often very available to those who would do harm to others. Meanwhile, apparently no efforts have been made to limit the availability of this potentially dangerous chemical compound.

Paid me 15 dollars less than the contract job did, and I ended up having to pay 800 a month for my insurance, which also had like a 10,000 deductible. And seeing a pandemic start in February I kept thinking fuck I probably need that.. though I may not be able to pay my bills, and eat.

a.) have credit for free food on
  
Or b.) if you don’t qualify for free lunch your parents could load the card with money
  
Cash was also a currency accepted to purchase lunch. Since I qualified for free lunch and the rich kids brought cash, I would offer to buy their food for less than they were paying. Essentially I would buy a $5 meal with my free lunch card and sell it to the rich kids for $3. I would starve every day just so I could save up and buy some books. I lost so much weight, and so fast, our family physician became worried. I received an intervention style chat with some family members and my doctor. They wanted to encourage me to try therapy or find someone I can talk to. I was a quiet, loner, goth girl- so of course they assume I’m depressed. I lied and said I lost the weight because I wanted to date boys. Now whenever I see a kid behind me in line at Barnes and Noble, I try to buy them a gift card and have the cashier buy their books.

I moved out at 17 and learned to coupon groceries to get by, sometimes I paid with checks a few days before pay day because I knew it took a few days to process back then...but I always ate once I became independent.  By my mid 20s I was making a little more money but I didn't stop couponing, I just bought more food. My kitchen cupboards were bursting and it was like an obsession and if I didn't do my little coupon routine every week I would get really bad anxiety. I had a long term girlfriend help me get past it when I was like 26 or 27. 

I'm 37 now and still have more food in the house at all times than I need, so it will probably be a lifelong thing. But I don't ever want to feel that pain in my stomach, or pass out randomly after not eating for days/weeks, ever, ever again. It really was fucking traumatic. 

I still feel a little guilty that in elementary school I used to sneak back into the classroom during bathroom breaks when it was empty and steal lunch tickets out of other kids desks.

If you have fogging issues with glasses and already have bought masks that have a 2-layer “pocket” try this:      
       
You can make the mask form fitting around your nose by putting a piece of 12 gauge copper wire inside the pocket along one edge where your nose is and then run a stitch down one side of it to hold it in place.  I cut the wire to be just a little shorter than the pocket so it wouldn’t slide out of position.
After sewing it in to place I bend it and shape it for my nose and cheeks to close the gap.
 I’ve done it and it works pretty good with my glasses.       
       


        
You can get 12 gauge copper wire (single strand) at home depot electrical department for about 30 cents a foot.        
(the kind that is used to wire houses will work best and hold shape. It is a single copper core not multi strand wire).       
I used insulated wire but 12 gauge bare copper ground wire would probably be fine too.        
         
Since it’s in-between layers of fabric it doesn’t touch your face at all.
Form fitting masks are more expensive.

Out of curiosity (please don’t take this as me trying to give parenting advice) but my cousin is non-verbal autistic with sensory issues so masks were definitely going to be a problem if they had to go anywhere so my mom suggested a scarf. Yes it’s not as good as a mask but it’s better than nothing. He doesn’t mind the scarf around his neck, nose, & mouth and actually seems to like it and play with it. Flannel is best bc of thickness of the material & it’s tightly woven so it will hold germs longer.

Thus, people  of all races with enough mental capacity understand ‘BLM’ isn’t a phrase founded on hate for non POC but rather a‘feeling’ based on events of past/currently-that black lives simply aren’t valued as much as their white counterparts. Hence, Black Lives Matter. 

Going into a predominantly black neighborhood with a White Lives Matter shirt would not only be redundant but a brash misunderstanding of why BLM came about and seemingly errr racist!


I’m all for conversation but ur feelings are a little misguided. There’s a false equivalence element at play when ppl say White Lives Matter. Nobody is contesting that.

I have never done ‘illegal stuff’ yet have been accused by police because of my associations -who also have never done ‘illegal stuff’ but judged by the color of their skin.  On the flip side- I once called the cops for help because my now white ex-husband pulled guns on my children and myself while drunk and high- he WAS doing ‘illegal stuff’ and you guessed it- the white officers who showed up did nothing! No background check, no tickets not a damn thing. They said I was over reacting! Oh yea, having two 9 mm guns pointed at you while you run and do your best to hide and keep your kids safe is not over reacting. It is scary AF! Yes, I made a formal complaint and got a restraining order.  My point- the ones doing ‘illegal stuff’ and are white CAN get away with it, but if you aren’t white and do nothing illegal- you most likely will be judged by your skin color.  And that is wrong.

It's just too bad the whole 'police reform' initiatives devolved into a debate over 'defunding' when the time was ripe to actually reform the system post George Floyd. The burden of bad policing certainly falls disproportionally on BIPOC and other minority communities, but this video shows that the problem is deeper than 'racism in policing'. The whole profession has an attitude and perception problem when it comes to interacting with civilians at large. It's like every cop has been conditioned to view the public as just a multitude of threats and they have to act accordingly in order to survive. This is the crux of 'Warrior Training' and it is wrong. Florida is not Fallujah and the police need to respect that we are all citizens with rights. For fucks sake 🤦‍♂️",2022-11-06 20:04:20

I rarely saw a cop in western Europe, I was in Holland for six months and literally saw ONE cop, and guess what? There's almost no crime there. In America I drive ten miles to work and pass 3-6 patrol cars everyday just looking for a reason to jack someone up. Wearing tactical gear and driving $70k+ suburbans, when schools can barely get a budget passed. Rednecks pretending they are in war everyday 🙄

The police have effectively declared war on the citizens at this point, yet cry like bitches when people don't like them or vote to limit their budget. Try not fucking people's lives up to juke some stats and see what happens. I seriously hope Americans, and especially the Republican party, wakes up to this.

I see little black boys that move into my area to escape the trash “hoods” that they created. Should I get 10 of my friends and neighbors and jump the kid simply because he’s black?
Do you think the door can’t swing both ways? My grand parents moved here from Italy in the early 1900s. I didn’t have shit to do with your family’s slavery 300 years ago. My family was looked down upon. And treated as immigrant scum. You don’t see us still whining. The point is NOBODY is hurting blacks for stopping in the wrong town. Try that shit with me In my car.

The point is USA is full of people from all of YOUR countries. My family came from Italy in the early 1900’s. Europeans are the ones that came here and killed off all the indigenous people and enslaved people from Africa.
The point is, you’re all hating on AmErICa when really America is your people. From all different countries.

u8shfo,I think it’s weird to have a strong opinion about a relationship you know nothing about but I 100% believe that they were both the problem. Johnny maybe he’d go out and get drunk and come home and yell or something but she already loved fighting (cause she most definitely beat Elon Musk’s ass that one time) but Johnny never hit her and so she was the one who physically start being abusive with him and because he’d walk away when she’d start hitting him that would make her angry and they started recording each other in order to gaslight each other and her being a woman and having this face 🥺 all the time makes it easy to play up the battered woman story when they were both very obviously equal in the fighting and arguments. Also those texts between him and Paul Bettany don’t do anything but prove that he has a very dark sense of humor,2022-04-22 14:20:14

In detention we were supposed to write a reflection letter on why what we did was wrong. I wrote all the reasons why homeroom was inefficient as it represented a period of time where I was unable to do educational things…which was why I was there in the first place, at school…and that it had no relationship to any biological need like lunch break did.

The following year was my senior year, I attended homeroom the first day to let the teacher know I would never attend again. And I didn’t. He still remembered me 5+ years later as the kid he had in homeroom that he met once 🤣",2023-05-03 17:31:48

When I was in 6th grade my English teacher wanted to see me after class where she proceeded to accuse me of having my mother or someone else write my papers. Apparently she was so taken back by my cursive writing she did a mini investigation comparing my written work with all my other teachers. She then asked me to write out a sentence in front of her to prove myself.

136hp56,"Man my junior year of high school I had an art class, and our final was to create out of paper a 3D sculpture. I did a little diorama of a scene from Portal 2, and I finished it THREE WEEKS before it was due. I asked to turn it in early but my teacher would not allow it. I painted watercolors in this class for fun every day for the last 3 weeks of the year. 

The due date for the project comes around and I end up getting strep throat and missing school. After a doctors appointment and a day on antibiotics, I return to school, making up finals and turning everything in.

My art teacher refuses to accept my final, saying that it’s not fair that I had extra time to work on it. I told her I finished it 3 weeks ago and had to miss school because I had strep throat. SHE ASKS TO SEE MY THROAT, I show it to her, AND SHE CLAIMS I’M LYING BECAUSE SHE CANT SEE ANY ulcers or whatever tf they’re called, I forget.  I called my mom crying because I was so proud of that project and it was bullshit because I had left it on my kitchen counter completed and protected for 3 weeks.

They thought I was playing a joke but I wasn't. I was laughing though for some reason I always laugh when getting in trouble. Well they thought I was lying because I was laughing and couldn't keep a straight face so I got in trouble. With 5 days of ISS and an F on the test.

136hp56,"Half way through kindergarten my family moved to a different town so I switched schools. A few weeks after I’ve been there, a snowstorm comes through and covers all the playground equipment in snow. We’re let outside for recess but not allowed to play in the snow. 

There was a path of packed down snow that had been created by someone(presumably an adult) walking through. Two boys walked on the path and a teacher came up to them to say they weren’t allowed to get their feet wet in the snow. The boys pointed out that they walked through the path, their feet weren’t wet, they were indeed following the rules. 

She accepted this explanation, and let them go on their merry way. 

I walk on the exact same path as those two boys. She grabs my hand and drags me to a bench for time out because I broke the rules. I start freaking out and argue that I did exactly the same as those two other kids!!

136hp56,"While I do understand why I was in the wrong, most kids in my school didn’t get in trouble for such a weird reason so it’s become a story I often tell people: Our PE classes were called “games period” because we’d be taken out to the field, made to do some basic exercises, and then we were free to do whatever we wanted so long as we stayed in the field. Naturally, most students would play whatever sport they felt like (these were not serious matches. As an example, basketball during games period would turn into a game of no-rules rugby where everyone would pile onto the person who had the ball and try to snatch it out of their hands), while others would lounge around on the benches just relaxing. This was meant to be a breather period for students. Some friends and I though… we’d typically sneak away and go to the library to study. But only after the exercises. The sports teachers knew who we were and what we were doing, and so did the librarian. The librarian would never support us when we got caught, but neither would she tattle on us if we were hiding between the shelves when the teachers came to look for us. I remember getting caught once when I was solving problems from RD Sharma and was punished (with the others) by being made to stand where the teachers could clearly see us for the rest of the period. I started bringing a notebook and my RD Sharma to the field after that. Till the day I graduated from school, my sports teachers could never get me to play anything 😂

I’m a non smoker myself but I remember the kids would smoke in the playground at school, I don’t think the teachers cared too much unless anyone was being very blatant about it. It was mostly the senior kids who only had a year left to go so I think the teachers were tired of dealing with the usual ‘bad’ kids.

Except for one teacher that made it his personal mission to catch people smoking and hand out after school detentions. That’s ok right? The kids shouldn’t be smoking in school and they know they shouldn’t, if you can’t do the time don’t do the crime etc.

But then I come home one day to find my parents looking at a letter from the school. Qcumber has been seen in the company of smokers!😱 not smoking just being around them, and thus I was guilty by association.

And I don’t need  them to push out a bunch of “grand babies” for me to have something to satisfy my boredom. Kids are expensive, and this word seems like a cesspool with global warming, high cost of living, divisiveness among everyone…. I’d worry about a grandchild’s future.

I mean no shade, as I am one of those hypocrites, one of the very few I've allowed myself as a human trying to have a life work living. I try to live so much of my life reducing harm to others and putting good works out, now in a phase of just trying to survive and maybe build up something - in myself - that can sustain in the choppy waters of commerce... In whatever bipolar, inflated, crashing mood it may be in. It's selfish to bring another soul into this chaos, indignant to think I could guide them to also be decent people, and maybe my family together can make the world sustainable, grow and protect the positive ideals I think can lead us forward.

It's a long shot, but what else would I be so enraptured with to bring out all of my best qualities. To steer such a family towards a net positive in all that is important to A family.

These are the unrelenting thoughts that drill my brain every time I just try to get to sleep, to armour myself for the wars of tomorrow 🧠 making an already difficult task all the more challenging and under resourced.

I did not listen to her and as much as I love and respect my mother, I never will listen to her on who or why I decide to like, date, or marry.  I went so far as telling her to ""shut up"" when she would not let it go and felt entitled to stick her nose where she shouldn't.  Boundaries.

The idea of a grown man allowing his mother, father, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, cousin, or anyone else dictating who you should or should not like, date, or marry is just insane. He lacks a sense of self worth, likely is insecure, and clearly not living his own life. 🙄",2020-08-27 14:35:42

That and almost everyone I know well says something like ""most gingers are so ugly but with you I really like it!"" or ""gotta admit, it took me a while to get used to your hair but now I like it!"" at some point.

 If you guys have a personal connection and the attraction is there, nobody should be off limits due to being ginger.

Now if on the other hand you yourself just don't find gingers attractive, thats a fair point.",2020-08-27 14:23:05

ycbvog,"This brought back a ton of memories, unfortunately. My dad would do this all the time when I was growing up and we’d go on vacation. I always felt super embarrassed and dreaded going to California because my dad always insisted on room that faced the ocean. Now these were at least one week stays, so I understand the frustration, but if I was in his shoes I’d just take a night in a room without an ocean view and resolve it the next day, because we always drove from Colorado and did 10-13hr days.

The dumbest time my dad got upset about a room (thankfully by then my mom had figured out how to reason with his weird hotel room obsession) was when we were just passing through and staying one night.

ycbvog,"Amazing composure but this perfectly captures what it’s like to work in retail of any sort. I work at Target and sometimes a guest (we have to call them that but they are no “guests” of mine) will ask me if we have more of something in the back. I’ll scan the item they have and my device tells me there’s no more in the back. “I’m sorry but it seems that’s one of the last ones and we have none in the back” and I will PHYSICALLY SHOW THEM on my device that there’s no more in the back and point and say “That number tells me if there is any more in the back or not and there is zero as you can see here.” 9 times outta 10 they’ll say “You’re not even going to look? There must be some back there you just don’t want to work!” Even though 9 times out of 10 they’ll interrupt me hefting huge boxes of product to ask and I have to set it on the floor or my vehicle to help their dumb ass.

ycbvog,"The only thing I missed from the lady's side is having the right tone and calling that mofo ""sir"" all the time. That makes these people really pissed off 😄.

The other side: once we had a Christmas holiday in a Hotel paid by my parents in law. We got a bit more than a  year old kid back then so we needed a room with a bathtub, we could not have a room with a shower cabin. Guess what we got... 

It was written in the offer plain b&w we should have had a room with bathtub. The recepcionist was dumb or playing dumb to cover the fault. So we had 1 night in a room with shower, tried to bath our son somehow and next night we got a room with a bathtub. After my mother in law asked for the manager. 

Once when we were in Berlin (before the birth of our son) we booked for 4 in a Hotel. Relatives had to cancel their part, as they could not make the trip. Me and my wife went tho. When we got to the hotel from the airport we found out that they misunderstood the cancellation email (a booking office arranged everything, for the last time in my life for sure)  and cancelled our room too. The recepcionist made a call and arranged a bigger room in their other hotel and called a taxi to bring us there free. Of course, in this video this is not the case, and most probably if this would have been an option, after this shady (yet so visible) trickery the lady would not go the extra mile for this asshat.",2022-10-24 19:08:24

A year later I was finally able to cry a bit when something reminded me of him, and my then-girlfriend immediately dumped me because she'd rather ""have a boyfriend who was made of sterner stuff"".

(Meanwhile, she herself was a kind of girl who would already cry when she was shopping and a nice pair of jeans wasn't available in her size - it's a double standard)

It took me many years to find out that not all women are toxic like this, luckily, but an awful large portion of them still are.

Which is ironic, because I've found out that with being able to cry, you process all kinds of emotions and tears actually contain stress hormones, so you literally get rid of tension & stress in your body. Which is the reason why nowadays I'm devotedly learning how to cry again on a regular basis, and I recommend it to any other guy out there as well. In the long end it may actually benefit your health, both mentally & physically.

I don't care anymore if people would reject me for it - health is more important. 👍🏻 And if people would reject or judge you when you express your genuine self; it's not about your worth as a person, but it's actually about their own shortcomings.",2024-05-16 06:43:22

We were in my bed and she just walked away because she wanted to watch the bachelorette with her roommates since it was their weekly tradition… another gf told me that me watching and helping someone that almost died the same way my bro did, shouldn’t matter and I should’ve showed up for her because her friend passed away even though my feelings were in shambles as well…. yeah im just gonna hold onto my feelings for now 🫡",2024-05-16 13:23:08

There is one out there for all of us fellas. ❤️

Being vulnerable is a superpower. Setting up boundaries is a priority. Finding out who you can be vulnerable to is the hard part.

Having empathy, understanding your feelings as well as what others may feel, and being able to express them through words or tears is what we should all strive for.",2024-05-16 15:46:30

I feel like I could display similar emotions to some of my female counterparts and have a less receptive embrace from people in general, both men and women. There are probably several layers of explanation both physiological and cultural that could offer ideas about why, but in the end, that seems to be the conclusion. Maybe it is just supposed to be that way. Maybe it's instinctual. Or maybe it needs to change. Idk 🤷‍♂️",2024-05-15 23:32:00

As if Gad himself was not a vulnerable person, a man, that needed help, support and understanding, and wasn’t a victim also. 

Like, his talking about the abuse he suffered. A show about his history. Imagine if it was a woman making a show about the same thing. The question would not have popped up like this (of course, it would be another questions, another critiques, as women experiences are frequently invalided; but I doubt her stalker would have been treated like this).",2024-05-16 01:51:52

1csqnsz,"""Men bad"" is not feminism

Feminism is recognizing how patriarchy impacts different groups of people through an intersectional lens. Like how patriarchy creates a culture where men are shamed for expressing vulnerability.

I just want all of you to know that your feelings are valid. You are a human being with such a wide range of emotions. FEEL them!! Express them (in healthy ways, of course)!! I encourage you all to be open and loving, no matter who has hurt you. You DESERVE to be heard!! You MATTER. You're feelings MATTER. You DESERVE to be accepted and loved fully!!

34 years later, I’m still kinda the same, I like to talk and be open and be emotional even to my wife BUT sometimes I feel like I shouldn’t do that because I don’t know maybe that’s what a shrink is needed; but even then I refuse to see a therapist to unload of years of trauma.

You could try learning what the tenents of fascism are (it requires real reading instead of memorizing a few slogans), what Republicans actually believe (try talking to some), and you might see how they are ideologically the opposite in most respects.

Your comment is r/facepalm worthy indeed.  That said, if only I assumed the sign is accurate and not leaving anything out - which I really don't assume - that's pretty ridiculous.

12zizy8,"Have you looked into cognitive behavioral therapy at all? It's very effective not just for diet habits, but for lifestyle and mental health habits as well.

Mostly about learning what your triggers are for bad behavior, and either avoiding them or changing the nerve pathway in your brain so they don't end up in the same result as you have made habitual.

I had to learn it about 10 years ago when I stopped self harming. Since then I've applied it to a lot of different aspects of my life, including weight loss and getting a handle on my drinking. I'm now at 124 pounds, and I only drink twice a year.

There is always slip ups in life, just keep getting back on the horse man. Learn more about yourself, learn to forgive yourself for doing stupid shit but also understand the reasons you've made those decisions. Don't hold on to your guilt, just learn from it!

I have a new primary care doctor at the end of next month, so maybe she will try and figure it out. This has been ongoing since I was anorexic though, so it’s not caused by obesity. It started when I moved to the US as a teenager and just gotten worse since. I’ve done all sorts of diets and nothing has helped, it still just goes right through. My anemia is so bad from it they’ve talked about giving me a port for my infusions because my vein access is starting to be so hard to get.

12zizy8,"Oh yeah, the healthcare system is totally jacked. I got diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis at the height of the first wave of Covid, and my pulmonologist literally diagnosed me and sent me on my way. I had to google the shit out of it just to understand what it even was. I wasn’t a Covid patient and he just dismissed me it felt like. It was fucked up. I keep getting told to see others, but again, they don’t take Medicaid. 

I know some nuts can be a thing, but it’s pretty bad. Nuts also tend to hurt more than the veggies. Leafy greens come out relatively intact, and broccoli is…. Well, it’s hilarious 🤣 when I’ve had something with certain food dyes I haven’t quite narrowed down yet it’s like a purple and green Joker convention. 

I’ve tried probiotics, adding more fermented and pickled foods, a few GI drugs I don’t remember off the top of my head, nothing seemed to help much. I had some ulcer problems fifteen years ago so I stay away from spicy foods as well. Chipotle chicken is as spicy as I get anymore. I’ve done Keto, and while I did lose weight, I was sick as a dog for the whole two months I was doing it. Missed a lot of work and college over it. 

The only thing I haven’t tried is cutting out gluten. I’ve been tested for celiac and they said it’s not that. I just grew up in Germany and Italy so bread and pasta are literally staples in my diet. I’ve cut way back, but I’ve never gone full gluten free. Cutting back didn’t do too much with the GI stuff, though I did lose ten pounds or so in a month of it. 

I’d happily be fat if it meant not having to consider setting up a damned office in the bathroom to get any work done 🤣",2023-04-27 05:48:19

I honestly think it's the shit processed foods allowed in this country. GI issues are rampant and once the damage is done there seems to be little recourse.",2023-04-27 06:09:07

The body camera video of the incident has not been released publicly.

Moore also said he was told there is video of the incident from a nearby gas station.

The Indianola Police Department confirmed that the officer involved in the shooting is named Greg Capers but did not provide any additional details on the shooting, telling CNN the police chief was unavailable.

CNN reached out to Capers for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Tons of pissing about, not listening, multiple occasions of throwing shit about the class etc, and that was the ""top"" class, one of the ones lower down actually got a guy to quit teaching, kids are kids, and there will always be those that piss about and need it re explaining to them multiple times

Atleast the school I was at didn't give too many fucks about just getting up and going to the bathroom mid lesson, only thing they really cared about were phones in class as it was around the time iPhones were becoming popular with the 4/4s that everyone had, even then though if you got the work done before the rest most of them didn't mind just sitting quietly on your phone while the others caught up

14470ax,"As a pilot, I would expect that „don’t touch anything“ was briefed before the flight. 

I normally give front-seat passengers a quick rundown of the various controls within reach and why not to touch them. Like „This lever retracts and drops the landing gear. Touch it on the ground, we drop onto our belly. Touch it in flight, the gear doors will rip off.“  That usually keeps their hands in their laps or clutching their camera. 

However, the only protection against stupid people doing stupid things for a selfie is to not take anyone with you. 🤷‍♂️",2023-06-08 12:48:11

I’ve learned the key is not just telling them to not touch anything it’s telling them it’s not an inconvenience for me to adjust whatever is making you uncomfortable, because most of the time that’s why my passengers have done it. One time I noticed the person doing what they were about to do and let them do it to learn a lesson. They saw a dial that says LEFT and RIGHT on it and they thought it was an adjustment to the heat (🤔), they were cold so they turned it right…they happened to select an empty fuel tank so the engines sputtered, I pretended to panic for a moment fixed the problem and told them that’s why I said not to touch anything. 

The one that pissed me off the most was a friend of a friend ( not a pilot and zero experience) sitting up front on final yanks the yoke back because he thought our descent was too steep. We had to do a go around and I told him if he touches anything or even talks again until the engine is off I’m leaving him at the airport and he can find his own ride home.

Like it doesn’t make you a person people are gonna want to date. Someone only wanted to pull up and hook up and I said I didn’t want to and they were like “you’re not hot enough to be worth the effort of dates first” and I was just like “ok man” I didn’t go and call them a short ugly person who isn’t worth it either.

Obviously I want her to be punished too, but that doesn’t change the fact that prison shouldn’t be built around punishment. A system that actually works to protect people should be > our anger.

As far as I’m concerned, potentially serving 14 years is enough to encourage other assholes to reconsider driving under the influence. If that isn’t enough, nothing will be.

If people think 14 years is too low in comparison to other sentences, then those other sentences are too long.

That being said. Fuck that bitch. I hope she dies miserable.

Where you managed to somehow draw the bonkers conclusion about rape from says a lot more about you than me. Sounds like you’re harboring some deep issues there. Perhaps you need some counselling or something? It might help with that baby-rage that causes you to spout unnecessary insults at people and act like human garbage. 
Perhaps I was wrong - perhaps you do need to take a break from reddit after all. You certainly dont add anything useful here from an intellectual standpoint.

While in sleep, it continues to effectively do the same thing, preventing you from progressing through the most restful and beneficial stages of sleep, keeping you at a lighter stage hours longer than the norm. People will then typically crash into those deeper stages near the end of their sleep period, but that's not nearly as effective or beneficial, nor do you get as much as you would sleeping normally.

A similar effect can be observed by having a television on in the bedroom, and in a dark enough room even the notification LED can be notably disruptive. It's actually rather fascinating just how much you can disrupt someone's sleep, and still not actually wake them.

The world is different now, but stop blaming others (including your parents) for your problems. Rather reflect inward and try find answers that dont involve pointing a finger at someone else.

Your parents have a point, before social media and this stupid fucking outrage culture, before google had all your answers you relied on community. People didnt evolve for millions of years with iphones and the constant dopamine fix of notification sounds

They are afraid that especially our cultural traditions are going to be forgotten. Although they are trying to counteract with talking to them and doing event for them frequently. (started several years before the pandemic of course ) 

I have told her exactly these reasons which are pointed out in the OP's post.
We are too busy and overwhelmed with worrying about our future. Otherwise we love to participate more if we could.

please exclude the aspect of faith in your comments under this.

There, you can see a price list in the doctors offices for  specific services  and you will be charged. One, they are way less than you would pay here in the US. Secondly, they are comparable, and sometimes superior to what you receive here. It seems that politicians are in the pockets of insurance companies, therefore, any legislation you’ll see is to benefit them, not you or I, unfortunately. Also, there is no money in cures, but billions to be made In Treatment; you can literally have a terminal disease and you will still have doctors come “treat” the disease that they cannot fix. However, you’re insurance is still good so they will have you come back to treat what they cannot fix!   Many people cross the border to get treatment because it seems that they get better results at a fraction of the price. And don’t get me started on dental work in Mexico compared to the quality and price of the same services here in America.

Can be a little better at times given the differences (mainly healthcare) but it's still got a LOT of issues... it depends on who you are, and what you've got when you get here. Or if you're from here but you're family is particularly poor it's still a struggle unless you absolutely kill yourself just to make up for that slow start. 

The different forms of assistance, unless its disability,  shits all over the ones actually trying, but others leech off the system with seemingly no issues... they'll cut off the well behaved ones cus they work thru the times the offices are open and would legit have to LEAVE work to have a mandatory apointment about you keeping a steady job and income 🙃 (they did that to me and I had to call and say I legit had to close then be at work earlier and unless I was gonna get 4 hrs of sleep and then work a 9hr shift after the appointment it was not easy for me to get to them) and in the case of those who are homeless, they send letters... nothing electronic, so if you dont have a home address you're fucked. And the low income housing is always run down nasty buildings ANYWAY, that still have obscene rent prices, and welfare doesnt give you the full amount they only pay so much and then give you like, a necessities budget for a single person. Like they give you the bare minimum and expect you to be able to find a good job that makes decent money to pay the bills you can already hardly afford with their help, while expecting you to jump thru hoops and go to meetings with them and courses and trainings to make you more employable even if you've already got a somewhat shitty but paying job. The only benifit is they do give bus tickets if you find work, and will cover most if the cost for certian medications depending on what it is.",2020-06-25 18:32:25

I think he also overestimated how much I was sleeping usually, assuming I was like most kids. My mom said that kinda helped a little but she held her breath till I finally woke up the next day.

But yep.  That's basically the way they do it now.  They don't use filmstrips or projectionists anymore.  It's all digital projectors which results in much better video quality than you'd get with a scratched up filmstrip with green lines and artifacts all over the screen.

Seriously tho.  Just stay home and stream it in comfort without any sticky floors, screaming babies, ringing cellphones, rowdy teenagers kicking the back of your chair, distracting usher flashlights, black ladies screaming ""DON'T GO IN THERE, CHELSEA!!"" in the middle of a horror flick or lewd people fucking in the back row.

They let you pick either a screening of one of their movies or you can bring your own device with the necessary adapters and stream anything you have on your laptop (yes, I’m sure straight up porn in the theater is against the rules.

We’d regularly go to Winco to buy soda, ramen, candy they’d put in plastic bags before stapling it closed with their own label.

Shady as all hell too. They would buy homeless people’s food stamps by running them as purchases and give ‘em 50 cents on the dollar in cash for drugs and way, way back in the day of me slinging QP’s to frat kids for 750-800 I’d buy lbs in bulk from a clean cut guy that I’m pretty damn sure laundered his money through the shop as a manager or something.

Random tangent, but just funny how that’s exactly how it happens when it’s not a brand name store. Best part was looking back he would brag constantly about being a devout Muslim in between bong hits and bragging about girls he’d sleep with (he didn’t) and really was just a spoiled kid that was given BMW’s, is still living at home in a nice part of the city with maybe 10 people total in a house that would be cozy for a family of 4. Muslims are weird man, but he brought me to multi-mil beach houses to do shrooms and would let me drive his car while smoking me out and introducing me to rich connections I’d network with later. 🤷‍♂️",2021-12-28 09:54:34

r6dncc,"I was EMS for 10 years. I know how this stuff goes. So you're telling me to use my brain when you are basing your whole opinion on this snippet rather than even attempting to see a bigger picture. I'm not defending anyone, but I highly doubt some rando cop would risk his entire career to arrest an actively working firefighter just because of ego. I'm just pointing out the fact that we have this and only this to go off of. There a million videos out there that have no context and automatically make cops out to be the bad guy. The story could be much more complicated. Maybe stop following the loud crowd and follow your own advice. Just because he is EMS doesnt mean he can break the law. Just because the  cop has a badge doesnt mean he can just be a dick. 
This was great, have a good one 🤙",2021-12-01 18:34:28

But I can't stand behind, much less respect someone who says the things he dose. He definitely let us down throughout this horrific crisis.

Come to find out the two that worked at the service desk would check out the couple other employees (and each other) and mark down flooring, furniture, and whatever else they desired at like 30-50% the cost of the item for months.  They thought they were safe because they used separate employees login info to use the register.  The store was well aware of it and waited till they hit a felony quantity and had them arrested.

I **never** stole because for one I'm not a thief & for two it's a stupid environment to steal in when you're surrounded by cameras. Anyway most of my colleagues were thiefs, some were slack & slipped up, others it was blatantly obvious. I would also suspect a thief when I would get accused of stealing by somebody else in management. I'd laugh when I got pulled in due to an accusation because I made sure I did every count on camera & if I stacked any alcohol I also made sure that was all on camera, but for some reason they feel they can defy the camera evidence & still accuse me 🤷‍♀️ so I'd ask them to actually put the accusation in writing & they would immediately drop it. 

Anyway one day my colleague randomly got the sack, turns out the people above us all & security were watching us all along (including the accusers) & they started investigating, sacking & moving these thiefs around the company. It ended up in the end just me as the original staff member with a whole new load of staff lol 💀

14k3rwo,OMG! This lady I remember at Target 🎯 not giving me my gift card and rudely saying “enjoy your day.” I spot on told her to review my receipt and that she didn’t give me my $10 gift card. Her response was the computer didn’t prompt me to. I told her to get a manager and she got even more frustrated and upset. The manager came and reviewed the transaction and the gift card mysteriously showed up in her pocket. I have never eye rolled a thief so hard at a check out aisle in my life.,2023-06-27 18:38:29
14k3rwo,I had a friend about 20 years ago who I refused to go shopping with. She liked to steal even though she could afford to pay for the stuff she took. I was pissed once when I found out she had stolen from Belk when I was at the mall with her. She put it in the bottom of my sons stroller 🤬 so after that I said no more. I would have cut her off then and there but we also worked together.,2023-06-27 09:21:46
14k3rwo,">Another story that shocked me was how much old people who are well off, steal. They don’t even need half the stuff they get they just liked the thrill of it.

I worked in a high end department store in the ladies wear section. The amount of old ladies who'd come in and subtly vandalise the clothing so they could get a ""damaged goods"" discount was insane. Our strategy was always ""store policy says we can't sell damaged goods. Let me find one on the rack that's in sellable condition"".

They'd always leave at that point.

Also, the amount of old ladies trying to smuggle things via the changing rooms was immense 😅",2023-06-27 11:56:39

Last time I checked that scientific consensus was the randomized control trials are the gold standard for evidence based conclusions. 
Anecdotal and observational studies are heavily compromised because there are no controls and many unaccounted factors that inhibit accurate conclusions from being made.

14biswz,You’re replying to the wrong person 😁,2023-06-17 07:51:58
14biswz,"To be frank, you’re full of shit. Half the stuff you’ve just said in the first paragraph is either logically flawed or just plain wrong. So now that I’ve read my NAACP-credited source, I’ve noticed that they succeeded to establish multiple meaningful links between slave patrol and modern policing, such as how when slave patrol was finally ended by the 13th amendment, after which *my source* states that “slave patrols were replaced by militia-style groups who were empowered to control and deny access to equal rights to freed slaves”. After *that*, the 14th Amendment was ratified which ensured racial equality legally. It also abolished many Jim Crow laws, but afterwards more Jim Crows began to emerge, particularly ones enforcing segregation. Then, by the time of the 1900s, as my source states, “local municipalities began to establish police departments to enforce and exert excessive brutality on African Americans who violated any Jim Crow Laws. Jim Crow Laws continued through the end of the 1960s”. In other words, the MODERN-DAY police department was essentially made to enforce (among others) anti-Black racist Jim Crow Laws. Does that sound familiar *at all*? Jesus. I can’t believe I had to break it down for you. 

For your next question, no, it does not strike me as odd given that the first publicly funded professional full time police force in America was established in 1838 while the slave patrol’s origins dated back to the early 1700s. You do the math, which is a smaller number between the two? 🤔

So clearly this “myth” is based on REAL facts, evidence, and logic. And if you actually read to the 5th and 6th paragraphs if the article that “I didn’t read”, it explains how the racial bias from police that enforced Jim Crow Laws *only 60 years ago* is still present. I’m not going to even bother explaining to you how the police are still racist as anyone with a brain can figure it out themself. 

While it is arguably true that a thing’s origins do not define its status hundreds of years later, as I’ve just explained the racism that the police was founded on based on the racism that the slave patrol was founded on is still very much rampant. 

I’m done replying to you as I’ve clearly just exposed all of your bs so shut the fuck up until you actually know ANYTHING about what you’re talking about.

Apparently, I need to spell this out for people who aren't too bright and don't understand how an infant can survive without a mother. Once a child can live outside of the mother, the mother DOES NOT have to raise it. Any capable adult can care for an infant or raise one! Once a child is born and alive outside the mother and can sustain life with or without the help of medical intervention it’s a human being.

None of that is relevant though, instead of crusading to force women to give birth why don’t you go foster children from abusive homes, born addicted to drugs. Why don’t you vote to provide universal childcare and preschool and medical care for all children?

Didn’t want to give him cash just for him to turn around and lose it on slots, but still felt bad, so I ordered him an Uber. This was before the safeguards preventing getting in the wrong car, so anyway the exact color, make and model pulls up, it’s an Uber driver. I watch him get in the car and pull away. A few minutes later the actual Uber driver calls me screaming asking where I am. I have to explain the ride wasn’t for me, I can’t leave the hotel and the guy who’s ride it was must have gotten in the wrong Uber. He cusses me out for wasting his time (I would be pissed too, but what could I really do?) and tanks my customer rating.

However, I have loved ones in the medical field that get requests for procedures or drugs that they really don't agree with. So they will tell the patient no. I think it's fine for a Dr. to simply say they won't do a procedure. Albeit, this is a dated reason I don't agree with. But I am certain this woman could easily find a physician that will do it. I think it's good for Doctors and patients to have that freedom of choice.

Had a nurse friend that was following up with a patient while the physician was there. The doctor knew these patients for over 15 years and was close to them. The patients came in to request ivermectin because they were scared of the vaccine and scared of COVID. The doctor told them he would not. They got pissed and told the doc to go fuck himself and that they would never come to him again 🤷

Obviously different than a woman trying to get tubes tied but same foundation. Person wants a doctor to do something for their body. Doctor says no. Patient can go to another doctor. (I don't know what doctor would prescribe ivermectin tho)",2021-12-13 21:56:42

Birth control is atrocious and I’ve tried every kind there is and my body doesn’t agree with any of it. Not being on birth control isn’t an option so have to permanent non hormonal option aka surgery. 

Even if one day I did theoretically change my mind (I won’t) I could still have kids through IVF or adopt because I actually wouldn’t want to carry a pregnancy. The simple fact that everything about pregnancy and child birth is absolutely disgusting to me. 

Also don’t even like kids. Never have. They can be cute from afar but I don’t purposely spend time around any children. I can appreciate that kids can be super funny, cute, intelligent and polite little humans who will do great things. But I just find them annoying to be around for extended periods  🤷🏽‍♀️",2021-12-13 21:53:04

It’s pretty common for women in their mid 30’s to have children now, but back then it definitely wasn’t. You’d think that by now we’d have more control over our legal rights concerning our bodies, but sadly things haven’t changed much in the past 50 years on that front 😒.",2021-12-13 18:10:44
rfigs8,"You make very valid points. 

I agree with you on most. 

Texas is fucked. We agree. 

If France is doing that, it’s also fucked. I does not make sense to not use the science available to you to get the right scientific answer. 

I also agree that I’m not really sure why circumcision was ever widely accepted on anyone. I’ve heard the classic its cleaner but I do not know why male circumcision became the norm in a lot of places. And I don’t have a penis but I can understand growing up and feeling like like happened to you and you didn’t get a say. I guess the only thing I could argue is that if the father isn’t there the mother shouldn’t have to chase them down to get permission if she was planning on having a circumcision. But again idk why that’s considered normal. 

As far as if someone gets prego.. I get that it came be frustrating to not have the final say on a baby that you 50% created. But, in my opinion you have to understand that as the body getting pregnant I do feel that I should have the ultimate say above the person who contributed to the pregnancy. 

Because even though they may, it is not guaranteed that the partner will contribute after the fact the way you thought or they said. 

However, I think ultimately this one falls on you (people in general) because it depends on how you behave. Because if you’re banging someone that you haven’t had all these conversations with. And you and that person get pregnant. And then that woman decides she doesn’t want a baby with you, she has that right. She never agreed that she was going to give you a baby.

Birth control- I’m also going to have to say birth control is rough for us. And it’s not a burden guys have to bear. It messes with your body bad, makes you gain weight, bleed, and feel completely different. That the pill. Others involve surgery and having stuff put up inside of you, it’s not safe. So it’s really not fair to just expect that we want or should be on it. 

I’m just not sure on the classroom grading seems a meh and broad but I don’t think it’s wrong to try and give girls opportunities in the classroom, they are still behind in a lot of areas. But no ultimately boys and girls should all be learning everything that they want to learn. Period. 

And lastly rape.. it’s a special kind of fucked on both sides. It’s takes a pieces of absolute crap to rape and to lie about someone doing it is equally as damaging. Dudes do get raped, but I would also argue that it’s probably not something that most guys worry about happening on a regular basis.. while we are. So yeah that’s a big cluster as well.

Or your coworker? Or your sister? 

I know for one, I couldn't just stand there and be a bystander, cause while most might do this to try and coerce a woman so they can sexually assault them, but others could have more nefarious reasons such as murdering them.",2023-02-13 21:37:39

111guiz,"My mother married a creep back in 2007. She was oblivious to his blunt verbiage and actions towards me. Luckily he never got in my pants. But I did endure a lot of trauma from him and his family over the course of two and a half years. He would sexually harass me. Didn't matter if anyone was around (mom and my little brother and sometimes his neice).... his neice would pick up on it and just giggle while sitting on his lap. They are my abusers. 

At home he'd make sexual comments of my cloths. Keeping in mind i wore cothing that covered everything. And at the time what was popular was these funny character tshirts. ""Those jeans make your butt look nice"" ..... ""I like bunny ears"" (ears was about the placement of my tits)..... i lived hourses and had thes mustang PJ that said mustang on the butt, was a birthday gift from family, but he made another butt comment and i burned those pants. I took down my horse collection. I told people i had no interest in them as i didnt want want anything else sexually to happen. Stopped wearing the funny tshirts. A few tomes he meant to touch my shoulder but ended up lower.....he seen me walk home from school and got turned on. He saved that detailed information for when I was in the truck alone going duck hunting... I had my hand on the door leaver ready to jump out not caring if that semi hit me and ran me over with his many wheels because in my head I thought my body would be messed up enough that he would make anymore comments....I never went duck hunting again. 

at school his neice would body shame me, spread lies that caused me friends and after school i would get beaten up by her. Once she attached me at her families house because her mother told her no at something she asked for and turned to me to take her anger out. I ran but got caught, thrown through screen door, glass door, down a flight of stairs and my face bashed into a tree with deep textured bark, which saved my nosed from. Being broken. At this point the adults finally got her off of me. And I do recall much. 

I spent a lot of time at my boyfriend, who is in a wheel chair. They understood what's happened and let me stay as long as I wanted. One time he came to pick me up (lived a few blocks away). He was big into trucks and hunting was fun to see him need out. And he did Ober my step Dads truck....later that evening police came to my boyfriends house. We were all confused. Police accused my boyfriend at the time to vandalizing my step dad's truck. I was like excuse me how does one know. Police stated my step dad saw whole thing from my bedroom window. Which places him in front of my dresser. Which I later found my undergarments fondled with.... I told the police what my step dad has been doing and the police office laughed and said I was being dramatic teen. I was loosing my stance in disbelief that a police wouldn't ignore a child (a minor!) And not even bother to look into it. Right then, my boyfriends friends heard everything I went through and became on my side and extra support. I was panicking and didn't want to go home. I was willing to sleep in a dog house if it ment not going home that night or any other. But my mom hollered for me... 

In the end he said something at the dinner table and my mom realized what I've gone through. Though she doesn't know all of it. Still doesn't to this day. Just of what he said at the dinner table. My little brother too young to understand. He finally got kicked out. Caused my everything. Almost my life too. To get him out. 

2.5 years to him to screw up and finally get someone to believe me and get him out. Though it didn't stop his niece's actions at school. She'd always attempted to attack me at school. She'd blame me but teachers new I was timid, excelled in school work, helped others wheen I could and seen me stay after school to get homework done just to not go home. But still got pulled into principle office for the fight probably to keep appearance of fairness. But they lecture me of how inappropriate fighting is... blah blah blah...

Months or a year later my now ex step dad raped a girl a about my age. As still got to walk free with an ankle monitor... that poor girl. If only i could have helped her. But i didnt know her nor did her name get released. 😭

""I need to find where I'm going"" implies you need help. He insisted in hopes you changed your mind and hoping you'd be drunk enough to just go with it.

111guiz,"These sorts of people don't care if you reject them. I'm not even pretty and I've had a few guys act like this towards me. Its scary af and those were during the day. Hiring a prostitute probably wouldn't even cross many of their minds. And I'd feel sorry for any prostitutes that do get hired because i doubt their boundaries would be respected by people like this. I'm not going to say ""all men bad"" because i know that isn't true. But its a large enough percentage of people who either act this way or defend other men acting this way that its not something that this isn't even close to being a one off thing. I've recently been hearing this sort of stuff being defended by my brother (andrew tate stan 😒) and its just so repulsive. I'm not really sure where I'm going with this other than people who defend people who act like this are almost as bad as the people acting that way. Its utterly repulsive. If someone rejects you then accept that and move on. Keeping on pushing or doing this is manipulative and creepy and is not acceptable at all. And to anyone defending this i think you should take a look at yourself. Why would you defend this. Is it because you would like to be able to act this way yourself and get defended after? (Idk if that is actually why people defend it but it really feels that way. From the few times i have heard guys defending this sort of stuff. They are usually the same sort of person who would do it to someone themselves) If you are this sort of person then you are just one of many other pieces of human scum who should be eliminated from existence.

That was really quite brave to try to intervene in all honesty.

Somebody has to at least say, “way to go man” 👍, even if some ppl think it’s just the decent thing to do, it’s often not an easy situation to navigate in si many ways & just trust you’re doing what’s best for another adult. So, way to trust your gut & take initiative to get involved & intervene to get her out of that situation.

It sounds to me like you're still in shock. You said in a followup comment that you fear retaliation from him. I encourage you to tell someone you trust that this has happened to you. Whether you want to turn to the police or medical professionals is entirely up to you, but you definitely need some kind of support.

111guiz,"Yeah, that’s a good point & a good distinction to make. I think in some ways it just sort of gets ingrained in some families that the older siblings need to protect their younger siblings but prob esp so w/a little sister I suppose… that was my experience w/it & maybe in some ways it was a little bit of a reflection of patriarchy, I guess I’m not exactly sure bc like I mentioned earlier, it was somewhat instinctual but I also always really did respect my sister very much & still do to this day. She was always brave & strong & always trying to keep up with & many times eventually surpassing her older brothers ;) 

One thing that impressed me early with her was she decided to spend a school year in Russia as part of a foreign exchange program as a sophomore & always had a very independent spirit & strength, & it impressed the hell out of me & frankly all of us. ;) That of course kicked off a traveling bug in her & she did a lot of traveling even when we were young like that, at this point I think I’m prob just sort of bragging about her now ;) but she was an incredible young woman & is a great person now as well & I’ve always looked up to her in a lot of ways & being her protector when we were young was really a privilege. She was also the youngest & that can often come w/families treating them as the baby, I think maybe esp w/females I guess but she showed us early on that although she might be the youngest, she was really strong & capable & in a lot of ways we all sort of acted as protectors for each other. But with guys/boys, I always felt some responsibility in helping to protect her & make sure nobody could take advantage of her in that way. Idk that I always did that perfectly & maybe overstepped at times but she was also able to let me know if I should back-off if she thought I needed to & I trusted her in that way too. 


Didn’t mean to launch into such a long & convoluted response ;) but I think you brought up an interesting point about “possession vs protection” & it made me think about it for a minute… 👍",2023-02-14 00:34:32

You are legally allowed to be sick for 10 days where you still get payed.
After that you have to take vacation days.

That children shouldn't be actively steered towards that knowledge because it will taint them, but rather be allowed to draw their own conclusions, without regard to race.

They believe teaching about historical reality creates a burden on white people to feel an undue guilt for the past, while also teaching PoC that they are innate victims. They claim it's actually empowering because they don't ""confine"" PoC to a victimhood mentality, which is what they claim critical race theory and literal history do.  Unfortunately it isn't just white racists who subscribe to this ideology, but also PoC like Candace Owens.  I saw a town hall of a black guy in one of the Carolinas spouting off about how racism is just something you see on TV and no one is gonna teach his daughter that she's a victim 🙄.

Please don't.  You really have no fucking clue what you are talking about.

Firstly, you do not need to do any research.  The vast majority of people posting on reddit do not have the knowledge, laboratory facilities, financial support, laboratory subjects, and other resources to do research.  All that they need to do is read about research that has already been done. 

Secondly, your research is inconsistent with what is known about the virus.  The coronavirus does not spread through bodily fluids, but through air.

Thirdly, the virus spreads from person to person who are in close contact with other people.

If that person is coughing or spraying it instead of saying it, like some people tend to do...  Then technically it can get them infected.  It's not like people are licking or kissing strangers (without alcohol involved) to spread it.  There's a reason why the say stay 6 feet apart.  Though there have been studies that show cough/sneezes can travel up to 27 feet:

>Lydia Bourouiba, an associate professor at MIT, has researched the dynamics of exhalations (coughs and sneezes, for instance) for years at The Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory and found exhalations cause gaseous clouds that can travel up to 27 feet.

ndpq3c,"The Mosaic Law held high standards regarding sexual practices and emphasized the purity and sanctity of marriage. Deuteronomy 22:21 says that the punishment was to “purge the evil from among you.” The breaking of the marriage covenant was not to be taken lightly. God wants His people to take sexual purity seriously. Sex is key in the “one flesh” union of husband and wife. Throughout the Bible, marriage is used as a metaphor to describe God’s relationship with His people. His covenants are unbreakable, and violations to marriage misrepresent Him.

Children of God are no longer bound to observe the Law of Moses, but the Law’s underlying principles remain true. For example, marriage is still a sacred union of a man and a woman for a lifetime, and adultery is wrong. The New Testament teaches believers to flee from sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18). The options for Christians are 1) remain single and celibate or 2) get married and remain faithful within that marriage (1 Corinthians 7:1–3). Today, God does not demand that we stone those who are not virgins on their wedding night—that was a specific law for a specific nation in a specific time period. At the same time, sexual purity should be held in high esteem. Sex is too important and meaningful a gift to be used outside of its intended purpose in marriage.

Source: https://www.gotquestions.org/stone-non-virgin.html 

My words: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 says “For everything there is a season"", including killing. Obviously killing your wife for not being a virgin is not included in that but for example: war or defending yourself (depends obviously) would include justified reasons for killing. The main thing is said above. All of the “contradictions” that you would be referring to would apply to this answer: The laws put in place in the OT were for the Jews before Jesus came and died. (*Don’t misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their purpose. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not even the smallest detail of God’s law will disappear until its purpose is achieved.* Matthew 5:17-18)

v0oinv,"GUN RESPONSIBILITY LEADS TO GUN SAFETY
A Common-Sense Approach to Second Amendment Issues.  ©
     With the increasing massacres, gun-related deaths, and heartbreaking reports of children with guns, (up to 8 child incidents per day in the US), almost everyone can agree there are too many guns in our society. The death toll is rising along with the number of guns. Mindful of the Las Vegas Massacre in which almost 1,200 rounds were fired, mostly into the crowd, by a single shooter in a very few minutes, it’s time to fully grasp that guns are primarily designed to kill or maim people and animals. Since their basic nature is lethal, society is fully justified in requiring firearm protections to ensure public safety. 
     There is no need or justification to repeal the 2nd Amendment enshrined in our Constitution, it was put there to safeguard freedoms… and freedom’s obligations. The way to address 2nd Amendment issues is to legislate responsible, well-regulated gun ownership as the 2nd Amendment clearly states. 
1.	  Responsibility of Gun Ownership
     As a deadly weapon, every gun must have an owner who is legally responsible for it.
An unregistered gun is a threat to civilized society because no one is legally responsible. Guns are dangerous. If no one is willing to accept the responsibility for a gun, it should be destroyed. 

2.	 Licensing, Registration, and Background Checks
    Every gun and its owner must be Licensed and Registered and all gun owners must pass a Background Check.
This is how society can identify and regulate who is responsible for a gun. Society mandates the same three basic requirements for motor vehicles, despite their primary purpose being simply transportation. 

3.	Insure All Firearms
    If you drive a car, you are expected to have liability insurance. It is your responsibility.
Like driving, gun responsibility requires gun owners’ insurance so that victims or anyone else involved can be suitably compensated. Society must not bear the predictable costs when individuals claim gun ownership rights without accepting gun ownership responsibilities. 
    Who currently pays to clean up a murder, suicide, or mass shooting? Incredibly, these costs are paid by taxpayers and victims.

4.	The gun owner is liable for their gun 
     No matter what happens with a gun, if the registered owner fails to secure it, the owner is both responsible and liable.
Guns don’t kill people, they are just efficient tools. People kill people. Guns cannot be held liable, therefore ‘accidents’ cannot be blamed on guns as they often are now. Gun responsibility requires guns to be kept securely, so they can’t fall into the wrong hands.  
     As a deadly weapon, guns cannot be ‘accidentally’ pointed at anyone. If anyone is wounded or killed by a gun being cleaned, handled, or dropped, the gun owner is responsible and liable.   
    Killing unnecessarily is horrible. The shooting of a child, or by a child, is the worst crime imaginable and must be treated as such. If a child has access to a gun, the gun owner is liable for what happens next. If a child or anyone else is ‘accidentally’ killed or wounded, the gun owner must, at a minimum, be charged with some degree of Murder. If a child has access to a gun, the crime is recognized by law as depraved indifference to the consequences of not securing the gun, and the gun owner is charged accordingly. Any of the above crimes cannot legally be the fault of a child or a gun. Accidental discharge cannot be considered a defense.



5.	Do Not Threaten Your Neighbor With a Firearm    
     Civilian concealed carry is sometimes necessary for self-defense, but a concealed gun does not imply a threat to anyone unless openly displayed. 
Public, civilian open-carry (in a non-hunting or target practice setting) is an implicit threat to your neighbor, a bully’s intimidation tactic. Open-carry put in basic terms demands (from another point of view); ‘Do not mess with me, I have granted myself Police powers. I am fully prepared to shoot you at any time, and for any reason, I think applies.’ Proponents may call it self-defense, or exercising their rights, but from another point of view, it is an assumed claim to possibly be your Judge, Jury, and Executioner.
Openly carried firearms have no place at Government Offices, public establishments, or at protests on our streets where they increase tensions, constitute an extra-judicial mob, invite law-enforcement reprisals, and intensify police militarization. 

6.	  Live by the Gun, Possibly Die by the Gun
     Stand your ground laws are a legal path to anarchy, because, from either end of the gun, you can legally be the next victim. 
‘Stand Your Ground’ laws say you only have to feel threatened to defend yourself, anywhere, at any time. Since it is often problematic to tell a good guy with a gun from a bad guy with a gun, anyone has the right under these laws, to feel threatened by civilian, open-carry. As a result, the threatened have the legal right to defend themselves. Like the Wild West, the problem turns into who shot first and why? The logic of these laws is indefensible.

7.	Rapid-Firing, Multi-cartridge Weapons Are Weapons of Mass Destruction  
     As a practical definition, any weapon that can kill many people quickly and easily (or silently) is a Weapon of Mass Destruction. 
Do the dead know any difference between a Bomb, a Chemical Weapon, or a Rapid-Fire, Multi-Cartridge Firearm? There is no responsible justification for civilians to own these weapons unless killing all your neighbors is considered self-defense. These are Weapons of War and Terrorism and otherwise have no practical use to society. We spend huge sums worldwide on our military to protect us from these weapons… just not on our streets. 
     Our Police, First Responders, and the Military are skilled public servants and deserve our support. Their lives are on the front line in the course of their duties. We should not ask them to face weapons of mass destruction, on duty or off. If you think clearly about it, no one on the streets of America, should. Own them legally or not, keep them responsibly, don’t parade them in the streets, unless you are prepared to surrender them.

8.	Militias Are Only Legal When Called Forth
     Although militias are mentioned in the Second Amendment, It is settled law that they can legally exist only if, and when, called forth by a Governor or President. Militias are private armies and require responsible control. Unlike an Army with transparent command and control structures with civilian oversight, a militia is an armed mob, a form of terrorist cell, responsible only to themselves, and potentially hazardous to everyone else. A peaceful society cannot tolerate guerilla forces in their midst, and certainly not armed, private militaries parading in our streets or practicing for the overthrow of our government.    

Finally, let’s take a moment to send our thoughts and prayers for our brave American children who give up their lives to protect our current, almost entirely unregulated, 2nd Amendment right to bear arms.",2022-05-30 11:07:51

More than one of these people have done exactly the same thing that you did. Even in a hospital setting. You did absolutely nothing wrong.

ndxgnu,"If “semen providers” would just get vasectomies in their teens, then we wouldn’t have to worry about unwanted pregnancies and child support at all! How about that?! Since the state attempts to force women to give birth no matter what, perhaps we should at the same time fight for the state to ensure that males cannot inadvertently and irresponsibly impregnate anyone. After all, “semen providers” are the actual *cause* of pregnancy in women-  they would do well to just keep their semen to themselves. Women don’t spontaneously become pregnant, and it’s funny…they’ll be on birth control, but the guy will be all like “I hate condoms, don’t want to wear one.” 🙄🙄🙄

Your specious statement or argument or whatever you think it is, is completely and utterly ridiculous. If a boy is willing to drop his DNA off, resulting in a pregnancy, and she elects to neither abort nor give up for adoption, well, then yes, he should 100% provide for his child. The fact that men frequently impregnate others and walk away and pretend *their child* doesn’t even exist, simultaneously leaving the woman to completely bear the burden of child-rearing is exactly why those laws exist. And that reason right there - them leaving her with an unwanted and unplanned pregnancy, that they will dip out on, is yet one more reason why women should be able to choose abortion. Maybe when males stop acting like animals, the need for abortion will diminish. 

Ugh, honestly I don’t know why I’m bothering to respond to you, because I know your comment is meant to be incendiary, and I imagine you think you’re making some sort of brilliant statement, but frankly, it’s completely the opposite. If anything, it shines a light on how often males walk away unscathed after impregnating someone…so much so, that women had to fight to make them act responsibly and it became law.",2021-05-19 03:42:27

My dumb ass didn’t immediately pull the car over and ask for a blowjob in the car or ANYTHING. And this was late at night. The most I ever did with her was make out and feel her boob. I never did get to fuck her and we went out separate ways.

I was way too nervous and I decided to stay and smoke weed with my boys.  I think about that from time to time, but I'm glad I didn't lose my virginity in a 3some cuz it could've fucked with my mental state and made me douchey (at least that's what I convinced myself 😅)

I think about that one all the time, but not for good reasons 😳

At 19, a girl I'd been drinking vodka with all night at a friend's holiday house jumped ontop of me on my bed (it was a shared room) trying to start something but I was too dumb to realise, so she made a joke out of it and jumped on my friends bed too (not to start anything) and then went to sleep.

s9pu0b,"When I was in something called the Disney College Program I became really good friends with this girl I was 110% attracted to. 2 months in, her friend was visiting from across the country so she got a hotel and invited me and another friend to stay and party in their room. After polishing off a fifth of vodka between the 4 of us it was time to get some sleep. My crush saved me a spot on her bed. 😍 This might be my chance, I thought. Sometime in the middle of the night, our legs slowly found each other’s then, our hands gently familiarized themselves with each other’s bodies while courteously trying not to make a sound and alert her 2 friends in the bed literally 2 feet away. Finally, our lips meet and it’s too much. We’re both breathing heavily pulling up our clothes under the sheets. I remember feeling her wetness over her panties when she said I don’t want to wake my friends. I had a sobering feeling wash over me and I agreed. I mean heck, I would’ve wanted the same if I was on the other side of the coin and we were going to spend the next 14+ hours together in lines so it was an easy decision. 

A few days pass and she was on her last shift of her program. The incredible part was we were both scheduled morning shifts sweeping in neighboring lands and her shift only started like an hour before mine. She finally took up my offer to sneak around backstage and show her all the secret spots I knew. I’m a big nerd when it comes to this stuff. There were many times we were alone and I was just taking in how cool it was. 

After we hit all the spots we went to my favorite break area under the train (you can watch it pass but guests can’t see you) to wait until her last time to clock out ever. I remember sitting at the table with her on a bench seat and she just goes on her phone with a “okayy when is it time to get out of here” face that’s now permanently engrained in my brain. At the time I just thought she wasn’t impressed. It wasn’t until months later I realized she didn’t agree to do that with me to get the free tour. I honestly don’t have a good reason I was so dumb other than thinking there will be a better time to make out, now, we are exploring. 🥴🥴

The Renaissance Festival was in town and cross promoting the event. There were two young ladies, super cute, corseted and uh, amply bosom’ed. We were low grade flirty over those few hours, and when the event ended, one of them said…”how tall are you? Wow, that’s really tall! I wonder how many cans of whip cream it would take to cover you up, then how long it’d take to lick it all off…”

I think I blushed, and then said something about the grocery store not having nearly enough.

On a big party weekend she sees me out on the streets and yells 'neatless!', comes up to me and puts her hand on my ass and says 'I've been dreaming of touching this ass' while looking me in the eyes.

I nervously laughed it off and wriggled out of her grip and walked away towards my friends further up the street. She was oblivious to me in school from that moment on.

Thats just one of many situations... I had girls in bed with me putting their legs over mine and I just froze and waited for the moment to pass.

s9pu0b,"When I was in college a girl I’d had a crush on for years started slow dancing snd rubbing up against me. Not knowing what to do, because we were good friends, I froze up and she said goodnight at the end of the night and went up to her flat without me. 

In my mid twenties, in a gay nightclub, a colleague I’d had a crush on for over a year asked me if I knew what cottaging was and followed me into a unisex toilet cubicle. Being drunk as fuck and scared, I told her to get out while I had a piss. I then went home. 

I think about both instances often. I was a virgin till my mid twenties and realised women actually liked me. I’m now engaged and happy and it’s all good but damn, I could have been with two women I think I was a little bit in love with. What a dumbass I was 😂",2022-01-22 10:24:24

She deadass looked me right in my lips and said “want mine? 🙃” while sticking out her tongue and the knotted cherry stem on it. I shoot back “dumb! you already tied it”…

Anyways long story short she asked me out in art class (our major at the time, another awesome quality about her, since I too was an art major) with a really cute letter she boldly/shyly handed to me and I turned her down! I said no! 😂😂😂😂 why?!?!

Anyway I was a bit more straight laced back then, so my friends all left, then after 10 minutes or so I figured fuck it, I'll go as well. I sneak out front and there are 2 girls a year above me doing the same. They see me, and one of them ( alot prettier than any girl that would normally talk to me) asked what I was doing. Told her the situation and she said hey so am I! She then recommended, so I don't get caught sneaking out, I should change shirts, to which I replied I didn't have a spare. She then offered to take hers off so I would have one, and that I should hang out with them for the test of the day. My reply was ""nah ill just run home"" and then did exactly that...

Slowly she started moving her legs on my thighs. I got a little uncomfortable and told this to my friend who was sitting on my right I was in the middle on both of them.

I have a close friend who suffered a mild heart attack ( if such a thing exists, anyways, that is what the MD told him) in Florida; it was cheaper for his insurance company to fly him back , first class with a medical attendant( specialized nurse in cardio vascular ailments) than to have him treated in Florida.BTW  if, he had to be operated in Florida, his medical insurance would have paid the difference between what the government medical system would have paid and the actual cost billed. So, yes, we do wait if we go to the emergency for an ingrown toe nail, otherwise, no. I had a hernia on the left side, about 8 years ago. I was able to choose  my surgeon, tell him what procedure I wanted (   https://www.medscape.com/answers/1534281-69895/what-is-a-plug-and-patch-repair-technique-for-open-inguinal-hernia-repair) and was awake during the whole time because I requested a local anasthetic rather than a lumbar drip (nobody fucks with my nervous system  😂)My total waitime, including the appointment to see the surgeon, less than 30 days.

I think a lot of conservatives don’t consider these things necessary unless it happens to them. I know because I used to be one. Now, i am sick chronically - I have a slew of health problems and I can’t believe I used to be that person. 

Im very very lucky to have great insurance and im lucky to be able to afford the constant doctor/specialist appointments, procedures, and 10 daily medications I have to take to live a somewhat normal and comfortable life. Not everyone is lucky like me. I wish we had universal healthcare for those unlucky people more so than for myself. 

I also hope that maybe some other former conservatives see this and that it might spark some change in the way we (formerly me) think. You don’t need to be suffering to show empathy. It’s really not a dog eat dog world out there like we were told. 💜",2021-11-04 19:28:12

Waited 20 minutes to see a Doctor, who then called down a Respiratory Therapist. Waited another 20 minutes for the RT. He gave him Raecemic Epinephrine and a dose of Dexamethasone. 5 minute treatment. 

This was enough to get us home to Canada. That night he got worse again. Went to local ED, in the small town I live in. He was transported Lights & Sirens to a Pediatric Ward in a bigger city. 1 Hour later STARS Helicopter had arrived with A Specialty Team. They intubated my 18month old boy, and flew him to Alberta Children's Hospital. We drove up and they had a living area for us to stay for the entire duration our boy was in Children's ICU - 2 weeks.

These people take cultural appropriation to a level that doesn't make sense, and forget that it was originally about highlighting when people take things from an ethnic group and pass it off as some new original idea without crediting where it came from. Or even worse, admonishing the original culture. Eg, Twerking being 'dirty and disgusting' when black girl were doing it, but beautiful and sexy when white girls picked it up decades later.

The kimono is clearly Japanese, as is a Chinese dress clearly Chinese. There's no way to pass it off as one's own. It's too engrained in their culture.

We did not pay extra, the same premium as regular/traditional Medicare. Same with the gentleman I cared for. I supported Bernie, and he made it clear that with his plan, everything would be covered for everyone. I understand that bills never pass as originally written (see ACA) but I hope the US can join the rest of the civilized world in providing healthcare to all citizens. Life can throw anyone a curveball, and no one should lose their health insurance because they lose their job or get sick. And yes, even though my taxes are high now (self employed) I’D be okay paying a little more so that I, and my fellow citizens, are guaranteed coverage. I’ve had everything from bottom of the line to top tier private health insurance in my lifetime.( Even went a few years w/o coverage.) None of the plans were ever as comprehensive as Medicare.

I’ve always been in mixed race relationships and never thought that it was *a thing* until my friend in high school said, “we all know you’re into Black people” and I was like “wait what?” Because I’ve dated some Black people makes me “into Black people”?

Another example is that my gfs nonna is italian, born and raised, her mom is italian born here but her dad is Mexican. She's Mexican Italian and us having children will make them more Mexican than Italian. BUT I do plan on encouraging our kids to marry italian, which my gf is on the fence about.

But just because white people fucked up a few times in the past doesn’t make it right to do the same wrongs in retaliation.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Ichthyology  most of the jokes will go over a typical gamer's head. There's also Tom Nook's Capitalistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Adam Smith's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Animal Crossing truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Tom''s existential catchphrase ""yes, yes,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Ayn Rand's dystopian American  epic Atlas Shrugged. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Aya Kyogoku's genius wit unfolds itself on their Nintendo Switch(trademarked and sole intellectual property of the divine Nintendo Entertainment Company).

This approach surprisingly works for a lot of women with genetic traits that they don't want passed on. This is just a suggestion incase you wish to have kids in the future but want some basic immunity for the offspring and I'm not saying this just for USA. You might need it just to have healthy children in general, freezing helps secure the healthiest eggs further decreasing the risk. Still best of luck.

$3 for a slice of cheese is a scam

I'll marry the man who takes me to McDonald's on the first date.

I love ❤️ McDonald's.

Bacon McDouble, extra ketchup, extra mustard, extra pickles, no onions.

A small fries

And a small pop. 

Let me explain. 

Did you know that at McDonald's, they throw away the fries and make a new batch every seven minutes? 

That's right.  Seven minutes is the optimum time to eat those fries (imho).  Still want the large?  Maybe lol

If we're dining in, there is a soda fountain there for refills.  So there's no need for a big gulp cup. 

And what if we just lack chemistry?  Why go to an expensive place?  Too many expectations. 

And if we go Dutch, even better. 

We can even pick up something for his roommate(s), so everyone wins. 

I would want him to know that I'm cool, right from go.

Save the expensive place for the anniversary.

I asked how else was I supposed to write the specs? I can't really change it or make it more descriptive or whatever. The specs are literal facts lmao.

“How can that person sleep at night”

Just fine. Thats how they sleep. And if not, its not because whatever it is that would make the one asking/wondering about it not sleep well

If one asks, one has a consciousness (that can affect sleep)

Either those ppl don’t have that consciousness (sociopaths and such)

Or they have other thoughts/issues that are able to bypass that consciousness (lots of acts appear to be of a sociopathic nature but after deeper inquiry reveal that the person is overwhelmed with a clusterfuck of other issues and have lost touch with their consciousness and values and all)

Dude gets all emotional. He says that he was raised wrong. His parents taught him black people we shit and n words. That he has grown up and some of the nicest people were black and have always treated him with respect. Infact white people are the ones that always look down on him as being a stupid redneck. 

So he continues... That he regrets what he did when he was a teen in Georgia. That him and a friend were at a field where they spotted a black family of four eating a picnic. Parents and two kids. That they had their.22 rifles and both unloaded at the family all the bullets they had and ran away. They ran home and never spoke about it ever again. 

That shocked me. I 💯 believed him because I had known him for a couple months and it was true regret. Immediately his friend my neighbor barks at him.. ""shut up, b**** how many times have I told you to shut up about it."" Btw it's not the neighbor who was his teen friend. Dude was crying and it was eating him up. 

So I asked him why doesn't he turn himself in. Did any of the family die? Dude clams up. 

So I tried to look up incidents.. it would have to be the mid to late nineties. Family shot up in a field in Georgia having a picnic. It must be a cold case by now... but any information to any such case am totally willing to give cops his name.",2023-05-18 09:54:14

The following is the comments of Dr Joseph Fraiman, an emergency medicine physician in New Orleans, during the FDA Advisory Committee meeting on September 17, 2021 regarding booster shots:  
\----  
""Hello. My name is Dr. Joseph Fraiman. No conflicts to declare. I'm an Emergency Physician educated at Cornell Medical School and residency with Charity Hospital, New Orleans.  
Where I work over 65 percent of the population are not vaccinated. I'm here today to ask for help for those working the front lines to help us reduce vaccine hesitancy.  
For this we need a larger trials that demonstrate the vaccine reduce hospitalizations without finding evidence of serious harm.  
𝗜 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘃𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝘂𝗺𝗯 𝗼𝗿 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗱.

For example, many of my nurses have refused the vaccine despite having seen covid-19 cause more death and devastation than most people have.  
I asked them."" Why refuse the vaccine?"" They tell me while they have seen firsthand the dangers of covid in the elderly, the obese, and diabetics, they think their own risk is low. They're not wrong.  
One nurse showed me this Oxford risk calculator. A 30 year old female has about a one in seven thousand chance of catching covid and being hospitalized.  
She asked me, can I show her studies that show her that the risk of serious harm from the vaccine is lower than her risk of hospitalization?  
The truth is I can't.  
Our trials weren't big enough. They weren't big enough to identify the vaccines cause myocarditis. Yet, now, we know they do.  
A recent observational study suggests the risk of vaccine induced Myocarditis in young males is higher than their risk of hospitalization from Covid. Is this true? We don't know. It's based on observational data. To know it's not true, we need a large trial that proves the vaccines reduce hospitalizations more than they cause myocarditis in this age group.  
The former FDA commissioner said, the original premise of the vaccine was to reduce deaths and hospitalizations. And that was the data that came out of the initial clinical trials, except as you all know, very well and fortunately unfortunately, so did my nurse, the initial clinical trials did not find the reduction in death or hospitalizations. Likely because they were inadequately powered.  
Yet the former commissioner is correct that the initial trials should have been powered to find a reduction in hospitalization.

#5 Oh, it is very easy to get a vaccine, anyone can get it. The vaccine hasn't even gone through proper testing. It's not a matter of being anti vaccination; we're vaccinated for everything except Covid. Why? Testing, you're the lab rat.

si8bm9,"Haha the first time I read this story I was like dang the Bible be cray!! Just for fun I’ll recap:

2 angels show up to Lot’s (Abraham’s nephew) door in Sodom & Gomorrah and so he invites them in for a nice dinner and what not. Good host stuff ya know. 

Well word gets around so all the guys in town (boys to grandpas) show up in front of Lot’s door and basically say “hey we all want to rape your 2 guests. Let us have a go”.

So Lot’s like “Come on guys don’t do that to them! Look how about you take my 2 daughters instead and have your way?” 

They all say “hell no! Give us the angels or we’ll do worse to you”

Then the angels blind everyone and are like “come on Lot & family, we gotta get out of here before the fire & brimstone start destroying this city”

So they begin to make a run for it, but while they’re escaping Lot’s wife looks back at the city, which causes her to evaporate into salt. Just poof gone for lack of faith I guess.

So now it’s just Lot and his 2 daughters trying to find a new place to live. Lot is worried about staying in a nearby town because he might have a bad reputation so instead he stays in a mountain cave with his 2 daughters.

After too much time in the cave, eventually these daughters get upset that there are no eligible bachelors around and begin to formulate a plan to get their Father (Lot) drunk so they can do the business with him. 

Well they do, both of em, and they both conceive children from the encounters!!! And then the story ends there.

Like holy sh!t what a story haha And if you don’t believe this is a real story then read it yourself. Genesis 19. 🤣🤣🤣",2022-02-02 02:20:48

u3q7qp,"Sure so, in 1989 at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield it was the FA cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham. There was a stand allocated for the Liverpool supporters where it was all standing, no seats. To ease crowd control at the entrance to the stadium they decided to open one of the gates at that part of the stadium and it caused an influx of fans coming in to these stands. Well there was a human crush and 97 people died. 

The Sun newspaper claimed that the Liverpool fans robbed people who were laid injured/dying on the floor and even urinated on them and stopped the police doing their job. Basically blaming them for the disaster. This wasn't true and fans actually helped paramedics get injured people out of the stadium. 

In the inquiry into the disaster, which took almost 30 years to conclude, it was legally determined that the lax security and crowd control was to blame. Kelvin Mackensie, the editor of the sun at the time had refused to apologise for years even after the Liverpool fans were absolved of blame. Eventually he, and the sun gave a weak apology, which by then, too little, too late.

Since then, The Sun has sold very badly in Liverpool and as I said some shops don't even stock it or refuse to. The Sun has been truly gross in some of its stories through the years, but this is the most infamous.

He and his family are Iranian and I’d prepare a Persian and American type of spread - NO PORK EVER. Grandma Sona was hardcore Muslim and it was a miracle she grew to love me and eat my food. Well his sister Sarah brings an appetizer and grandma is eating them. I glance and felt something bad. I say, “Sarah, are those stuffed mushrooms?” She says, “yes! I made them with sausage, it’s fine.” So I’m feeling my bones shake at this point and I’m starting to get that rattle in my voice, it’s coming, I’m going to cry. So I take her outside and say, “why the fuck did you give grandma pork?!?” She says with a straight face, “it’s not pork, it’s sausage.” I clarify I heard her say sausage twice and despite her acknowledging it, she’s yet to realize that sausage is pork. I call her brother out and he starts to berate her so much that I had to switch to defend her. It was a mess. 

It’s been 16 years and I still hate myself for not telling grandma that Sarah fed her pork. She passed away never knowing. I know it’s not my fault and Sarah should’ve told her, though by then she’d eaten all of them. 😭

I’d like to add that his other sister who I moved in with us later got a massive list of fines in the mail from the toll roads. It seems she was driving through them and not paying. Why? Because she simply didn’t think those fees applied to her.

193dxyv, And before you start the talking points about how we took down polio. Um 😐no we didn’t. Do research on that too. Polio ran rampant because people were spraying some kinda of mosquito/ bug repellent. All over their bodies while they ate lunch it was in people’s wall paper. The side effects was the poliovirus. Once they band the use of that product. Polio disappeared 👻,2024-01-11 11:12:25
193dxyv,"Because i research what i put in my body. Because i see lawsuits taking place and i see the negative side effects of it. Because this vaccine was NOT developed and tested like the others and we don't have decades of usage with well known long term consequences (or lack there of). Because it is ineffective (you can still get covid, even having bad outcome and you can still spread it) and only lasts a few months so you are obligated to keep taking the risk for life if you want any supposed protection.

The downsides and risks of vaccine do NOT outweight risks of covid (i am healthy, young individual. I have no reason to be afraid of covid any more than other viruses we live with daily without panic), especialy not enough to do it repeatedly. Also it is mrna vaccine, no tnx. I am too much of a science, biology and medicine nerd to be taking that route. Again if covid was some deadly plague or if vaccine was effectively assuring safety then that would be a different story. But as it is? Nope. Do nit come near me with this cuz i will take it only over my dead body 🤷🏼‍♀️

I do my reseaech and use my logic/critical thinking skills that i officially have pretty developed (always performed exceptionally on logic tests, IQ, and on critical thinking scenarios, had been told by multiple education professionals that i am above average, getting top score etc. So i have MORE than enough confirmation that i can trust my judgement). I am also aware things are not always as they are portrayed and anybody that blindly trust governmemt and media is naive. Even the pharma industry is not always upfront with you ;) that's why i decide for myself and there are certain vaccines/medications that i will absolutely not be preassured into - covid one being at the top of the list😅 

Plus i lived pretty normal life all these years and have yet to catch it. Imagine if i had been taking this poison every couple months out of fear of something i never even get. Some safety precautions and paying attention to immune system is all i need. Btw if you know how immine system works, you are aware why we are better off building actuall resistance to the virus naturally (like we did with other similar viruses) instead of taking ineffective vaccines for it. I would say dumbest thing is doing what you are told without using your own head",2024-01-11 15:31:28

193dxyv,"No but i can read what virologists and epidemiologists say and check data they provide. Then use my judgement if something does not make sense/goes against the facts. But also these are all people. Being virologists does not mean they will tell you the truth, you can't blindly trust everybody just because they are in the field. In all fields of science you have people who present their data according to agenda and you should always acknowledge that. If two virologist say contradicting things and one you can see with your own eyes is happening, while the other one claims something that reality actually seems to be opposite, which one are you gonna trust more? Hopefully not the one that tells you obvious misinformation. And sometimes it is not even  misinformation but just omitting parts of information that change the picture drastically tho.
Not to mention we have something called INDOCTRINATION in pretty much all fields of education. So again just because a person has degree, does not mean they are telling you what is best for you and not agenda they themself have been taught to follow. There are plenty of scientists from these fields that are very accomplished and have spoken against what mainstream says, supported by research and facts. They have no less of a degree than those who you listen to. The difference is just that they used their brain and knowledge and noticed something was not adding up and spoke out! 

Being smart in one area or having vast general knowledge about various fields because you are interested in basically everything (apart from cars lol) is quite the difference but yes, i am not claiming i know more than doctors. But i do have test proven great amount of logic so if something makes sense or not, i am gonna notice. And if two specialists on the topic say contradicting things and i read all the info i can find on the matter, i can trust my judgement into which one to believe, because again i have the skills to notice if something in the provided data is not making sense or is going against the facts, while the other doesn't.

Also pointing out again there are heavy lawsuits going on, on international levels. Supported again by professionals and data. But ofc media wont be braggong about that, they want you to keep vaccinating. Every buisness wants best for them and have biased agenda ;) majority of people are just naive and easy to control, which is what government and big industries mastered profitting but yall will still bleeh after them and attack anybody that is not going with the narrative.

Idc what you do with yourself, trust whoever you want, if you are right - awesome for you, if you are wrong - well it was your decision. But i will do what is best for me, based on my knowledge and sources i found to be credible. And that means i am NOT taking this vaccine and will die on this hill if need be🤷🏼‍♀️ i just said my stance, didn't say anything about those who got vaccinated. You were the one that started drilling me why on earth would i  chose this and how it is dumb, i gave you my answers. Do with them what you will, i know my reasons.",2024-01-12 15:10:04

She followed me like a little soldier, as I walked as fast as I could toward the women’s bathroom, with him in pursuit.

Even though the polio cases, overall, we’re dropping, thanks to electricity, the sterile method, indoor plumbing, refrigeration etc, people still lined up to get vaccinated. The media scared people into getting it, just like they did with covid. I don’t think people hoarded toilet paper back then though 🤔

Today, as I’m typing this, there are more cases of vaccine-induced polio than there are cases of wild, naturally occurring polio.

Also, the powers that be changed the definition of what polio was to make it seem like the vaccines were working. Meningitis is it’s own separate thing now. Back then, cases of meningitis were being counted as “polio.” Just like 2 years ago, when flu cases were being counted as “covid” and the sensitivity of the PCR testing was adjusted, conveniently, at the right times. Oh, and don’t forget that the definition of the word “vaccine” was changed to settle the arguments that were against the current mRNA shots being an actual vaccine by definition.

of acquiring herd immunity.  
As in, it will never happen. 
Yes vaccine immunity wanes (so far) 
in 4 to 6+ months. And naturally acquired immunity along with it’s lovely lifetime gift basket of sequelae 🐙 wanes in 3 weeks. 

People are understandably frustrated.
If we had reached the 90.8% like we had with measles, it’s possible our current outcome might have been different. So now we’re left dealing with the antivax pseudoscience and the 98% survival rate BS. 
States will fight to undo childhood vaccinations requirements. We’ll see a resurgence of childhood diseases, and deaths, because with Covid, children dying unnecessarily has now become acceptable. The past’s sense of responsibility towards community health, and for each other no longer exists.

Even in my own job/department, positions that call for X years of experience or a particular skillset could be done well by people without a resume to back up those things. A lot of times, even in technical white collar jobs like mine, an employee willing to learn, ask questions, put in the time, and show up on time will beat an employee with 5X the experience but none of those soft skills.

There is such a vicious cycle going on in the U.S with these types of situations like in this video.   There are how many cops there? 5? EMT workers....  What happened to START this situation that it takes that many cops to get it under control ?   The guy on the stretcher, we assume, was injured during either a crime or altercation ....   He spits and cusses out the cop that unfortunately hits him WHY because thst cop stopped him first? Or the scene is personal to the cop (maybe another cop got hurt for ex.).

rzqc2x,">The police, firemen and even teachers get paid 💩to begin with

Absolutely wrong and extremely misleading to couple cops in with teachers as underpaid public employees.

Cops are extremely overpaid. [Police budgets are massive.](https://www.vera.org/publications/what-policing-costs-in-americas-biggest-cities) The median salary for any police officer in the US is about [$70K a year](https://theconversation.com/defund-the-police-actually-police-salaries-are-rising-in-departments-across-the-united-states-161977)—but that doesn't the extremely generous overtime pay that officers receive and are often over-compensated for (as a reminder, teachers are *not* paid for overtime). [In Boston, where I am, cop overtime averages $30K a year](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/03/16/opinion/boston-police-overtime-still-out-control/). Because of this, it's not uncommon for cops to make 6 figures—again in Boston, officers make \*on average\* [**$130K a year**](https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2021/02/0213%20BPD%20OT%20-%20Docket.PDF) when all is included. Cities and towns openly publish their public employee's salaries. I can guarantee if you look at that for your town and sort from highest to lowest, that list will be littered with cops and you won't see a single teacher.",2022-01-09 16:55:06

Not too many pills; some steroidal stuff and Advil. Total expenses: $80 I think. It’s actually so low I don’t even look at what I pay (bad approach, I get it) and I have another cat scan coming up to see what my remission percentage is. The fact that the money wasn’t an issue allowed me to focus on getting healthy and stay positive. I can’t remember, does stress effect physical health ;) We are in an election here in Canada and the NDP party wants to up it even better. Jagmeet Singh (I’m undecided on who to vote for fyi) wants to make it so we just swipe our health card now, not our bank card. Happiest country btw…I’m under the assumption that it’s actually Bhutan 🇧🇹. Their GDP is actually based on happiness. Not materials.

hluis2,She looks and sounds like a ridiculous fallout character ffs 🤦‍♂️,2020-07-06 21:22:41
hluis2,"As opposed to, whomever she means by “we,” needing “in-of-state” liberals telling them what to do? 😂

She’s claiming it’s only “out-of-state liberals” trying to tear down Alabama’s “Confederate monuments??” How could she possibly know that everyone that has been telling “her” what to do about these monuments are all liberals and she knows they all live outside of Alabama?? 

The monuments that have been erected upon public property are a public domain, and are not individually owned by the State of Alabama as Alabama’s property. It is the property of the People, as pertains to the whole. The People of the State of Alabama are part and parcel “We, the People” of the United States of America. There are not two “People” that are the beneficiaries in this nation. Thus to remove a monument requires DUE PROCESS. Liberals and Conservatives don’t decide shit in this nation, only the People have that power alone, as a whole. 

And how does she know that none of them, who she claims are telling her what to do, are living in Alabama?? 🤷‍♂️

It doesn’t get any clearer folks, these two political parties are already operating as a bipartisanship tyranny right under your noses, on your watch, taking your tax money to fill their pockets and fund their personal and political agenda, slowly taking your power away from you to use it against you until they feel confident enough that when they reveal their true intentions which is to overthrow the supreme law of this land and make a mockery of the idea that nations can be ruled by their own People, rather than one individual tyrant possessing absolute power over the whole. 

The writings on the wall. They blatantly make absurd claims and because you think you are a liberal or conservative you trust and believe whatever senseless bullshit they say because of what political party they belong to. 

LOOK at what they are doing in Washington. They are viciously fighting for political power between two political factions who’s bipartisanship is only to keep any other dog from getting into the fight. To let a third political party gain enough influence with the public would be detrimental to the cause of both the Republican and Democratic Parties to be the last one’s standing to make the biggest power grab in today’s world and declare their regime has the right to overthrow the Constitution and operate openly as a tyrannical government that will declare one of their own as the Dictator and leader of this nation which primarily includes ruling over the people, and the freedom and liberty we have already taken for granted and has become a comfort zone will pulled out from right under your feet. 

LOOK at what’s happened with every single TV and cable news channels in the U.S. These two political parties have bought every single TV/Cable news channel in the nation. Most of it has been purchased and is being used by the Democrats. They used the People’s tax money against the People buying up the news media as the People will take a lot of what is seen and heard in the news media as being credible without even knowing where the news agencies got their information from that they are reporting as if it is really happening as they only claim it is and the vast majority of Americans that keep tuning into these news networks and publications won’t bother requesting, even demanding, they provide their data source for their story. They make so easy for those who don’t really have their best interests at heart to mislead them. These two treasonous political parties and their now covertly State controlled news media tell their viewers “this nation is divided, with them putting on quite the show of division in Washington, which isn’t entirely an act, they are two factions who have been at war before the Civil War, but Americans are letting their information upon which they make their choices come from those who want to overthrow them and make the People subject to laws they won’t have a say in anymore. Most Americans can’t even imagine what living under the rule of tyranny must be like. It doesn’t scare them because they have little to nothing to relate to in order to understand what these two political parties are up to and are already doing right out in the open. Trump TWICE threatened to send U.S. military into states controlled by Democrat Governors to put an end to violent protests and encampments lead by liberal movements. The elected Democrats took no action against those groups acting as if they were in support of these liberal movements, but are only using these people for their political agenda which doesn’t include benefiting these movements. The Democratic Party has been using the violence of these liberal movements as well as using the horrific crimes committed by undocumented aliens that the Democrats keep releasing them to the streets without deporting them or upon conviction and sentencing they don’t bother making them serve their time and they just drop them off on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border which they illegally re-enter the U.S. almost immediately and if they commit a more serious crime such as murder, rape, child molestation, sex trafficking, any crime that severely triggers Americans emotionally that upsets and angers them they blame it on the Trump Administration.

Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are interested in serving the People’s interests as a whole. To do so would be a conflict of interest especially in today’s climate with what’s going on in THE PEOPLE’s public offices.",2020-07-06 08:30:35

We can debate until the cows come home on the ideals that allow wealth like this to accumulate, and what the best avenues really are for maximizing the good one can squeeze from an otherwise fallow dollar...

...But it is simultaneously true is that Gates *is* doing something demonstrably positive while bezos can't pay his whole workforce a living wage.

I think we can all walk and chew gum on this issue, and agree bezos is more Kingpin than Batman (mixin' my comic universe metaphor 🤦‍♂️).",2020-09-05 19:10:02

qc1rgo,"Can we stop saying ""free"" already? Nothing is free. Countries either pay for it via tax dollars, or the government borrows from central banks, or elsewhere. Either way it isn't free, and people have been lied into believing that it is.

The US has a problem with bureaucracy that believes throwing money at something solves problems which is why we have bloated social programs that aren't effective at executing their mission statements leaving trillions wasted. The USPS works at a deficit and works like shit, we spent trillions on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan only for it all to be wasted decades later, the SEC is proven to be complicit with big banks and businesses against retail, and the IRS is now going after people with only $600 in the bank account to generate additional tax revenue because they aren't going after the wealthy.

This country owes nearly $30-trillion in debt to the banks; $2-trillion budget deficit, and we're spending more like clockwork. I'm not saying we shouldn't solve these issues, but to believe that in the US we're going to solve these other issues by spending the money to open up other branches of government is pure speculation.

Emotional support (believe it or not, humans need this); Birthday presents (yeah, if she's not going to celebrate my birthday then I'll go and celebrate my birthday with women who will); Decent sex (based on her attitude so far it's fair to assume that she has absolutely zero consideration for her partner's needs); Nights out (why would I want to go on nights out with a woman who doesn't love or respect me? She can stay at home being a housewife😊); socialising with my friends (there's NO WAY I'm introducing her to my family or friends with an attitude like that.

They know the place, the routine, the hours, where the money goes...

It only makes sense. 

I remember when I worked retail I was a cashier, but as a new employee wasn't allowed to actually handle the money that goes in the safe at the end of the night. Only the ""team leader"" would take the register trays and lock them up. 

But during my training, the boss showed me where the safe was and even showed me the inside of the safe. I watched him open it. The passcode was easy: it was a ""cross"" pattern. I wasn't even trying to cheat, I just happened to notice as he typed it in that it was a ""cross"". 

Fast forward 6 months and I'm closing the store with the ""team leader"". She's in a rush, and the idiot closes the safe before all the bags were in. Team Leader is freaking out because only the Boss knows the code to the safe. 

We're going to have to call him at, like, 10 pm and explain all this, he's going to have to come in...

I simply said, ""I know how to open it"". Team Leader was SHOCKED. 

I tried the ""cross"" pattern and it worked. Team Leader was happy she didn't have to call the boss, but, why do I know the code???? I said, ""I won't tell if you don't tell"" 🤷‍♂️

Yeah white people were slaves in Rome over 2000-1000 BEFORE THE TERM WHITE, BLACK, or EVEN MODERN “RACE”, EVEN EXISTED

Race as we know it was *literally* created to justify to horror of racial chattel slavery in the 17th and 18th centuries (and then extended when the cotton gin industrialized slavery).

The way humans were treated was so horrific that Western Europeans knew people at home wouldn’t support the practice unless they saw themselves as a different species than those they persecuted and enslaved, hence the world fairs, human zoos, and scientific racism in the 19th century.",2020-07-07 10:22:26

ohqdjw,"Wow I’m extremely shocked I got a positive supportive comment lol I usually get nothing but ppl calling me a dumb ass and any other name you can think of.  

But I 100%  agree with everything you said.  Funny how the majority of the population heard “you need to do this to stay safe” and just do it.  No questions asked, no research done.  Nothing.  How many times has there been a prescription or OTC drug available for years and years then you all the sudden start seeing those “if you’ve ever taken so and so prescription and experienced any of these side affects, including death, you may be entitled to compensation” 

Like you said, Pharma is not only a business, but probably the biggest one in the world along with Oil and they will push whatever they can on to the public I think bc they know most will blindly just take it. 

But, we who ask questions and don’t just blindly follow what the powers that be tell us to do will somehow always be the “idiots” and “selfish assholes” who are putting everyone at risk.  If I was someone who was blindly getting these vaccinations I’d be much more scared of the risk of what’s going in my body rather than the person standing next to me who didn’t get it who most likely has nothing what so ever that could harm me.

I dreamt about quitting loudly, especially after they dropped me from $15/hour plus 20% commission down to $6.75/hour minimum wage on a draw against commission (paid only when commission exceeds hourly rate).

Does this woman want to be chased so she feels desirable or is she actually not interested?

In today's times I'm not chasing you and ending up on some list, if you hit me with a stiff arm I'm getting out of there.

I would love a little hesitant playful back and forth with a woman but people are too extreme these days, there's no such thing as a misunderstanding anymore. If I hit on a woman and she doesn't like me all of the sudden I'm some kind of predator. 

Talk to your fellow ladies, it's just not worth the risk these days to play all these mind games women want to play and you can't really blame men for staying away.

Very similar to the post about the woman who was feeling alienated and lonely because men at work kept their distance from her. This is what you've been fighting for, equality looks eerily similar to loneliness when you're used to attention from everyone. If more women were pushing for a more even-handed approach to dealing with REAL predators then the rest of us who just want to talk to women wouldn't be so scared to try and push some limits.

I still approach women in public and the ""no ""responses I get range anywhere from ""Im flattered but not interested"" to ""someone call the police"" 😂. I would consider myself to be fairly non-intimadating in my approach and I only talk to women who make eye contact with me.

Don't forget, also, that Tinder exists.

I saw her walk around campus and worked up the courage to shoot my shot. I was like ""he, (redacted), my name is (censored). I think you're cute. Would you wanna go out sometime and get some food or something?"" She shut me down. A few times actually. I was persistent. I definitely wound up getting her attention because we passed by each other a few times and I wouldn't say anything to her. Majority of the time I would say hi. One time she seemed super angry when I tried talking to her. The very next time, she was nice. This all happened right before COVID. I asked her for her phone number and she told me either ""no"" or ""next time."" Next time never came :(

Sucks cause she was cute and had a real nice butt (I'm talking super big and 🍑) 😫",2023-08-26 14:19:07

161tt4l,"As 40 year old man working in a nearly all 20yo something female environment in the Midwest. Sometimes it feels like, if you engage polite conversation and they’re into you, you’re nice. If you engage in a polite conversation and they’re not interested in you, you’re a creep. 

I just want to have a polite conversation. Same conversation I have with women at work my age and there doesn’t seem to be any issues there. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Edit: clarifications as this got more attention than expected and I apologize for any misunderstandings this may have brought up for people. 

1: I am brown (bi-racial, half Mexican and half white) and from California (moved to the Midwest last year). I never experienced the above in California. 

2: I do a lot of self reflection, discussions with my wife, and discussions with people among my support community who help me and challenge me. 

3: I’ve never been told that I’m creepy. I’m just playing it safe with young women who seem less engaged with me than others and I, SOMETIMES, wonder if I come across as if I’m “interested” in them. When this happens I give them space, it’s purely intuitive on my part. I’m sincerely interested in them as human beings and coworkers. This interest is better received among people my age, and younger men, and my fellow POC, than SOME younger white women that I work with. 

Finally: I recognize that there is a great deal of nuance to the human experience, and I hope to hear from your experiences and learn. I respect that there are a lot of experiences you’ve had that my comment may trigger memories of that elicit a response from you. I am going to read those comments, reflect, evaluate if it’s something I haven’t encountered before, and then likely not comment back other than to say thank you.

YES, his new policies on fuel have definitely caused prices to rise.

Which in hindsight, is a reflection of the values and morals your business posses. The lack of accountability that resided in this situation certainly astounds me.

A statement and your forthcoming ""efforts"" is not enough justice to relieve the trauma of this strong woman you coward against. Such utterly disgusting behaviour, please educate your staff, reinvigorate your inclusivity into the community and certainly MAKE CHANGE.

Nevertheless, I will certainly never dine nor support this venue. I dearly hope you educate yourselves on equality and actually contribute to make change in your community, even with an obvious lack of capacity to avoid such situations. This should NEVER have happened.
All the best in your efforts to come to reality in this inclusive world.

So she and my dad convince me to get on a presentation about health that the community has put together (not sure if they’re doctors or other health experts). One of the first things the lady talks about is how Ghee is unhealthy and people shouldn’t be listening to Facebook 😂 My mother was not amused. But she did listen to the lady. I didn’t get much from the talk, I learnt everything they were saying in school and other sources. But I was extremely glad I was on that call. I try to remind her about that when she starts with the whole Facebook thing. Unfortunately it’s effects weren’t long lasting. At least she doesn’t use ghee anymore! Point to my long rambling speech.

lg0w4i,"Medical debt is when you have a bill from a hospital or a clinic or a doctor's office and you can't pay it in full, or some portion of it, by the due date and so it gets (automatically) turned over to a bill collections agency who will then hound you and harass you until you die to make sure you pay. If you still can't pay, you can declare bankruptcy.

For example, I don't have health insurance. 1 month ago I had excruciating pain on my right side. I just knew it was acute appendicitis. I went to a clinic close to my house and they ran tests and gave me some medicine. I told then I don't have insurance. They said you need to have surgery immediately. They called hospitals in my area to see who could take me. 2 hours later I was driven to the hospital, but not before the clinic handed me a bill for $1500. I got to the hospital, was really loopy from yhe medicine they gave me. They had me sign a bunch of forms, and they took me into surgery. It lasted a grand total of 3 hours (from the time I entered the hospital to the time I left). The next week I got a bill for $2300 from the Emergency Room of the hospital. I called the billing department and asked if that was my total bill...the lady on the phone said no, the total bill (including anesthesia and surgery) was still being calculated but would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $15000....with a possible discount because I don't have insurance. I will likely get a total bill that is $10000. Which I can't pay. And won't pay. Because this country's health system is fucked up. So it will go into collections and I will have medical debt that will follow me around for the rest of my life. All because I can't afford health insurance and because of 1 emergency that I couldn't predict would happen. 🤷‍♀️",2021-02-09 16:07:28
lg0w4i,"That's interesting. They put me on morphine for the pain. I was a bit loopy but I wasn't incapacitated in any way so I don't think it would be taken into account. Plus my mother was there (she had to drive me because I was in so much pain) so she basically cosigned everything. 

It's just the fact that I've gotten 2 emergency room bills (one from the freestanding ER/clinic and one from the hospital ER) that pisses me off. Like if I had known for sure 100% that it was THAT serious and I would need surgery right away I would have just gone straight to the nearest hospital and not wasted $1500 at this doc-in-a-box ER. Total fucking scam. Which pretty much sums up this country's entire health system.

Edit: Oh and the best part. The hospital ER bill was $2300, with an $800 discount - so only $1500 - if I pay it by the end of February. 🙄 Fuck. That.",2021-02-09 18:28:28

uzz4yd,"Let me get this straight. God decided to give gunpowder to people who didn't even interact with the west until after the Mongol Incursion? 

Republicans are disingenuous morons who use nationalist rhetoric sprinkled with the *WORST* possible interpretation of Abrahamic religions. 

You really want to say that God gave man firearms? 

We know *as a FACT* that gunpowder was discovered and developed by China in the 9th century. 

It is considered one of the ""Four Great Inventions"" (四大發明).

You want to open a can of worms by claiming that God gave those inventions to unbelieving gentiles 4400 miles away from the holy land? You know that gunpowder only made its way to the west after the Mongol conquests in the 13th century.

Did God send the largest empire in history to blaze a trail of death, destruction and the deadliest disease in recorded hostory? Did God really go to such capricious and sadistic lengths to make sure an absolute waste of life like Wayne LaPierre can hold a flintlock rifle in the air and claim divine right in the wake of **Yet Another Elementary School Serial Murder**™?",2022-05-29 03:31:56

My mother was a hairdresser for decades for older clientele, and this shit happened ALL THE TIME.  They want people that are familiar to do their hair. This girl just looks like an idiot now.

GOD is indeed all knowing, omnipotent, and creator. GOD loves his creature so much that he allowed free will. But in order for us to CHOOSE, we must have the freedom to do so. This can only be possible if evil n good exist.

This is easily explained by looking at parents n children and life experiences. A parent could simply just refuse a child to eat( because they are afraid they could choke while eating), refuse that the child learns to drive( fear of accidents-), refuse that a child engage in different activities ( Because they are afraid something bad would happen to the child).

 If the parent did this, we would say the parent is abusing the child, surely. But because the parent loves the child so much, the parent  lets the child eat, drive, etc... Even if there is a risk involved. The parent just does their very best to teach the kid how to avoid those risks. Now the child can choose what activities to engage in freely.  Free will.

You can't have free will in a restrictive world. Even by our human standards, we call that abuse. So evil had to exist to allow humans to choose.",2021-10-22 03:53:29

But seriously, I love wasps! Here are a couple facts:

\- Wasps are essential for ecosystem functioning and indirectly responsible for increased food production.

\- Most wasp species prey on other insects, including agricultural pests (the ones hovering over your drink are adults in search of a sugar fix to fuel their flight). Some wasps are parasitoids, laying eggs in other insects. After hatching, the offspring feed on those insects, making them a natural and effective pesticide.

\- Many wasps are also essential pollinators. Figs, for example, are pollinated by minute, specialized wasps (Fig Wasps)

\- Yellowjacket wasps are also very effective and essential scavengers that are partially responsible for breaking down decaying fruit and flesh in the areas they live.

gm2316,"> If you support gender equality, you are by definition a feminist. This includes men's issues. 

Yeah, no. It speaks for itself that a movement supposedly for equality between genders is still named after one of these genders today. Sure, when the term was coined it was women who were in dire need of some equality of opportunity upgrades, but they successfully fought for these for decades and as a result, western countries now have unprecedented levels of equality of opportunity. 

But today’s feminists are not interested in that, they are interested in one thing and one thing only: expanding women’s privileges. That’s it, they don’t give a shit about equality, let alone men’s rights (:DDD), you’re deluding yourself if you genuinely think they are even remotely concerned about true equality or men’s issues. I don’t think I’ve heard of anyone demanding female quotas for male-dominated but low-status jobs, have you? But you *have* heard “more women” chanting when it comes to male-dominated, high-status positions, after all, the more sought after a position is, the more equality™️ we need there. But seriously, cherrypicking privileges so blatantly is a joke, and this is just one example.  

Anyway, yes, women and men of course both have their fair share of issues as social groups, however, women voicing these concerns (especially as a group) are still considered strong and independent, while if a man opens his mouth about men’s issues (or god help him if as a group), they’re instantly labelled an MRA misogynist incel rapist creep beta whatever, and told to man up and quit bitching. Before you recite the usual “this is toxic masculinity and men are responsible for it” it is women who degrade and flat out shame men for speaking up about their issues, not other men. 

I guess the gist of what I’m trying to say is that feminists actively and shamelessly suppress the other side of the equality coin, and solely focus on women. They also completely get away with it by riding the historical “equality” wave which is still richly featured in their narrative (it has to be, it’s the ideology allowing them to get away with so much shit) but it has now completely disappeared from their actual motivations. Look at what they do, not what they say. 

Try egalitarianism instead of feminism, has a nicer ring to it, plus it really is for equality instead of only for women under the guise of equality.",2020-05-18 23:01:15

Like, that pride is gonna go hungry now. The difficulty of securing a meal for these guys is no joke. It could be days or weeks before they get anything else. So it's surprising that this sort of behaviour happens. 

I suppose I'm oversimplifying because I'm not a biologist and am a bit of an idiot. Not to imply that nature is perfect. Just that such counterproductive behaviour is rare. Sure, weaker pride members might be culled after this. Actually yeah, that's probably literally it. Less lions = more water buffalo for everyone.

I guess I was just using “respect” to sum up those three things.

Like if we’re talking about Native American textile art - 

If I spent time learning about beading, putting in some effort appreciating it for the craft, noticing the variations in form, and learning about context it was created in, then I can partake - use it in my art. 

As opposed to if I saw a headdress, thought it looked kind of cool, and slapped it on for my music video.  

Some people skip straight to the partaking.

Sometimes it’s tough to know to what extent the learning and appreciating was done, though.  Or how much of that work needs to be done before it’s acceptable.  That’s why I try not to have hard rules and just consider these things on a case by case basis.  🤷‍♂️",2022-10-07 17:57:42

r3bfj3,"Yeah, nothing like destroying your own community sticks it to “the man,” right?

After all, look at all the massive change that was enacted by the BLM riots. 🙄

“Have some empathy.” Yeah, okay.

The LA riots were not “protests.”

They burned down their own community, targeted Korean-owned businesses, killed 63 people, injured 2,383 more people, and looted every store they could.

There was no unifying chant, or march in solidarity. No protest at the courthouse. It was an opportunistic crime spree. It was beyond “acting irrationally at times,” as you put it.

Literally, the first thing they did was raid the liquor stores. It’s almost comedic.

If you want something to be “empathetic” about then look no further than the case of Larry Tarvin.

Or you can continue to cry crocodile tears for a man that endangered countless lives by drunk driving over 100 mph in a high speed pursuit through residential areas and multiple red lights. I would’ve beat his ass too, and race has absolutely nothing to do with it.

Furthermore, Rodney King went on television and personally pleaded with the rioters to put an end to the madness. The very same person they were *allegedly* doing all this for.",2021-11-27 16:33:01

And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be a position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.”  - Abraham Lincoln, 1858.

Joe Exotic is a power hungry animal abuser that kept drug addicts as his ""husbands"" knowing full well that they're only with him because he feeds their addiction. We're not even talking about the shady campaign, deals with Jeff Lowe, and assassination attempts.

Parents use this to defend their lack of mask enforcement.

putrg6,">	Buddy, it wasn’t forced in that culture.

I love this argument - “but you see, slavery was voluntary”

😂",2021-09-25 14:27:20
putrg6,">	Reason why africans became the main source of slaves was because they were relatively ""uncivilised"" 

Lmao that’s colonial propaganda, aka “white man’s burden” - an entirely racist concept.

None of the African countries were any less “civilized”, and in fact, in many ways, the Europeans were the uncivilized ones because they had poorer hygiene (and many STILL DO LMAO), than African countries’ population.

>	just be sold off to Europeans.

Poor Europeans were like “oh nooo nooo we don’t want slaves at all! We don’t want to economically exploit people all around the world, but FINE, we will bring CiViLiZaTiOn to these n*****”

😂 

>	slavery was not seen as a bad thing in the past 

“It’s fine when white people did it in the past because it was cool back then you know? Slavery was fine!”

😆 

First of all, chump, slavery was condemned by many people around the globe even during the heyday of slavery. Those critics were called quakers. Look it up and get a fucking education.

Second, white people knew slavery was wrong but they justified using your rationale - “but we’re bringing cIvIlIzAtIoN to these n*****”

Racism somehow made it okay in the eyes of white people’s societies.

>	Native Americans in both north and south America would also get mass enslaved if.. well.. 80% didn't die of foreign disease.

You mean white people’s diseases, that they purposefully infected the native Americans with, to genocide them like USA did?",2021-09-25 12:43:46
iccp6w,"Preschool, kindergarten, and even 1st grade are really the best years for school for kids. At home learning really sucks (but is necessary) for all kids  but this has to be horrible for these little youngsters. None of the fun crafts and fun everything really, especially for the kids who don't have fun parents or parents that have to work and cannot make it fun. Really really tough times (but necessary). I hope 🙏 they do well and can make the best of it.",2020-08-19 02:11:46
iccp6w,"As usual, I’m late to the party, but this really hits home. I’m teaching kindergarten from home, and I hate it. I try my hardest to make it entertaining; I give them breaks every 30 minutes; I play videos and songs, and I make funny voices and faces, and it’s just not the same. You can see they’re burnt out by 1 pm (sometimes even earlier). 

Today, I had a little boy telling me he was gonna get something from the fridge and would be right back, a little boy picking his nose during our shared reading, and a little girl saying “I’m gonna go eat, ok?” during our math block. 

I also had a parent apologizing for having to take her daughter with her to work where there’s no internet connection, and the girl had to use her mom’s phone. Technical issues happen every day, and of course kids are not able to fix them. Half the time parents can’t either! 

My colleagues and I are really trying to make the best of it. I’m trying to come up with easier ways to click links and join our Google meetings, online activities, etc. but it’s just so draining. It doesn’t feel like I’m being effective, some parents are watching my every move and others interrupt my class to ask where their kid is supposed to click to work on the activity I explained 20 minutes ago.

I’m sorry this comment is so long, but I just had to vent. I’m terrified to go back to my classroom (I have older parents who watch my daughter while I work), but I miss having my students around. I miss their hugs, and their weird “secret” comments. I miss patting their head congratulating them for finally sounding out that difficult word correctly. I miss them going to my classroom library after I read a story to grab that book again because they loved it so much. I’m in tears writing this. 

I truly hope we can look back on this soon and say “remember that time we had to go to school but stay home at the same time? Yeah, glad that’s over”. I want my old job back. 😔",2020-08-19 05:03:16

sk0c0d,"This is straight up a narcissistic sociopath and the world is rampant with these fkn people.... 

If you know someone close to you who may act this way to idk service workers or retail employees etc. I'm sorry to tell you but they are going to rip your heart out one day. Slowly covertly scheming. The world is their soap operas and they are the puppet Masters and will create nightmares and drama literally out of boredom...

Everyone thinks they have the one that will get better, or maybe it's not narcissism it's not like they are full of themselves, or they don't really abuse me so I'm fine... But nah... If you have even a sneaking suspicion I suggest looking into it and save your own sanity don't say a goddamn word and run like hell before they gaslight you to the point of suicidal. 
They make the word Satan seem like a baby show on TV... You don't know what true absolute evil is until you encounter these peoples actions on the regular and how analytically sneakily evil they truly are.  They will eventually take off that mask and you will be trapped and they will likely never let go either until they sucked your entire life force and do yourself in or you wise up enough to run like hell.... But careful.... They may hit their depression point (happens when they are forced to face the truth they are not the greatest thing in the world they are the worst...) and seem like they have changed dramatically, they are making effort and actually do love you after all.... Wrong. Your betrayal of their idealized self will be punished, They bite your head off like a praying mantis and throw you out and never even think twice about it again. Then they use some illogical blame shifting nonsense against you, lie to the world and state you are the abuser all along and use that to get sympathy of others to sink their talons into some person with lots of empathy and wants to help them. They'll replace you with that new supply who doesn't know what hell they just walked into....

They are like a bucket of water with a hole in bottom. It's leaking. You can keep pouring and pouring more into it all your love and effort and energy until you have nothing... It still leaked out the bottom. And when you run out then why do they need you? New cup to the rescue and certain doom!

There was 4 HC parking spots, the remaining 3 was available but this random woman still wanted to make a scene. 

Me and our friend came over, my friend in a walker, looking really sick and fragile, and my friend calmly said ""Lady, why are you yelling at my driver?"". The woman tried back paddling talking about how kids playing pokemon would park there and people missusing the system etc etc and she was just standing up for disabled people. My friend pointed out that it would not have cost her a single calorie to walk up to the front of the car and see the HC parking card for herself before shouting at a stranger, and this was not standing up for anyone, this was just her beeing a bitch.

He broke up with me to go date someone else in our online gaming friendship circle and had been flirting with her while still in a relationship with me. About a year later, he broke up with her saying he regretted breaking up with me and being in a relationship with her wasn't what he expected it to be. This relationship had been entirely online except about a month prior to breaking up. The girl was transgender and had only recently transitioned. I'm like... wtf, well you're just double douchey for that. The whole time we dated, for some reason he would say how he could never date a guy, and later said the girl was too manly? I dunno, can't remember exactly. I've seen trans girls who you couldn't tell, but I would think you prepare yourself for whatever outcome there and be accepting regardless if you're choosing that type of relationship.

Basically though, he was trying to get back together with me and saying how everything would be like it used to be. I was about a month into dating someone new and finally getting over him when he contacted me. I told him, sorry, but no, you've already hurt me real bad and the guy I'm dating now hasn't. He tried telling me this guy could never make me happy like he could, lol. Still told him no and reminded him of how much we fought.

And the guy he was trying to get me to leave is now my husband. 😆 Bullet. Dodged.",2021-03-27 22:58:47

One of them reached out to me years later and apologized. He had grown alot since he and I were dating and he was remorseful for the way he treated me. I said I would forgive him only if he treated his future woman right. Another one (I heard, through a mutual friend) that married a very attractive woman who belittles him every day and has cheated on him several times already, but they have a couple of kids together and he's holding onto her for financial reasons.

Gen X survived and don't give any fucks. End of story.

Gen Y tried/is trying to unfuck the mess from Gen X. Millennials are also split as a generation whereas older millennials are more like Gen X in certain terms (i.e. grew up without computers) while younger Millennials are more like Gen Z (the digital generation).

Gen Z should be considered the worst. They want instant gratification and handouts as it's all they know. Their validation for existence is internet based and graded by memes.

Gen Alpha should be the reboot. 

Of course these are generalizations and there are exceptions. The gen gaps are evident on social media, typically based on preference of platform. Kind of like how FB is considered an ""old person's social media"" now.

12o472j,"African tribes vehemently resist intermarriage. But it is confined and hidden behind doors in intense family debates.

But there is a hierarchy of ""issues"" e.g. religion, tribe, different nationality, race... a different race is always more problematic regardless of who you are. Takes a lot of effort to gain acceptance.

Underlying basis is always the same. Need to preserve cultural or racial identity. Mixed children are perceived not to fit ""our identity mold"".

I'm mixed myself (different tribes, halfcast here) ... it is true you actually don't fit on either side!! 😂

Is it racists-why would you ask the people doing it that question?  Why not ask the TARGET of said alleged racism to see if THEY find it racist?

As a person of color - since there truly is no race but the human race, it’s impossible to “mix races” so yes, any implication of the kind is inherently racist to me.  Unfortunately, if someone has decided for themselves that it’s not racist, I become the “bigot perpetuating racism” for suggesting that their “completely open-minded belief” is even the slightest bit racist 🙄.",2023-04-16 12:45:28

So my thought is, and this may not be original but, is the reason white people, and other singularly raced groups of people - think small rural towns, England, other places my high ass can’t think… …but yeah, do these people have a higher illness and poorer evolutionary fare. 

Think about how the people of small towns, ethno-states, and the inbred-British have poor teeth, worse health issues, they just have “that look”.  And the deeper it gets the worse it is.

For the unknown, we learn English, Hindi and Sanskrit(1 foreign, 1 local and 1 regional language, different for different states) in our basic school curriculum and can decide which one to choose for our rest of the studies moving forward.
