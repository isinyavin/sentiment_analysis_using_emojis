k4qide,"You're not kidding. I used to cook at this huge inn where I live. Every year this group of like 100 gay dudes would rent the whole place for four days. There was the main inn and like 12 cottages as well.

They always called it Gay Ski Weekend, the attendees, not the staff.  I mean we did too but only because they had already been calling it that. 

Because they dropped such absurd amounts of money in the restaurant and bar and rented he whole fucking place they could do whatever they wanted. 

God damn. Talk about drugs. One year I saw bath salts, cocaine, poppers, ecstacy, molly, lsd, various piles of pills, opium, probably othera I don't remember. They'd literally just have metal trays with this shit piled on them for whomever to take whatever they wanted. 

It was wild. I was apparently seen crawling around on my hands and knees at like 2am one night of one of those weekends... I had clocked out and just started drinking with them. Then I left and promptly drove right into the woods on the property of the inn. Stupid. Damn those were crazy fucking parties though. There would be dudes passed out naked in hallways and shit. 🤣",2020-12-01 23:39:55

That being said, I don’t have any special admiration for Putin, but if he can take the deep state down I think that would be a good thing.

Cancelling him at every angle possible doesn’t bode well for encouraging him to back off, it’s only going to give him more reasons to say “Fuck it” and light a match to the world. 

God already drowned a world that was corrupt beyond redemption. It is believed that he will destroy the earth the  next time with fire. If he (God) chose to do so he could launch every missile on earth at once.

t3pgaz,"It’s been really strange seeing such an outpouring for Ukraine. With so many other horrible things happening in recent years I’m so curious why we are all so shocked about this one in particular. 
Is it because social media is SO much more prevalent just in the last couple of years? 
Have we just had enough? 
Is it because it’s playing out like a movie?

901p5f,"His actions recently can only tell you one of three things.  1. He was convinced by Putin a few days ago that our own country’s intelligence is wrong and Russia had nothing to do with it (please🙄) 2. he is so narcissistic that he needs to deny Russia’s involvement to prove (to himself as well as the country) that he legitimately won or 3. Someone is in someone’s pockets.  Whether it was Trump paying Russia to help him win, or more likely Russia paying Trump for control over one of the most powerful nations in the world.  All of the above though, tell me that the country is not his number one priority.  I understand that can be said of almost all politicians, but when it’s this blatant and in your face.... how can you stand behind him.  Do you really believe he misspoke (is that how you spell it?!?) even when he confirmed in many other medias that he did not blame Russia for the interference?  I personally take it to heart when I’m treated like I can have the wool pulled over my eyes sooo easily. With ALL that being said...

Phillip came to me today, 
and said it was time to go. 
I looked at him and smiled,
as i whispered that ""I know""

I then turned and looked behind me, 
and seen I was asleep. 
All my Family were around me, 
and I could hear them weep. 

I gently touched each shoulder, 
with Phillip by my side. 
Then I turned away and walked, 
with My Angel guide. 

Phillip held my hand, 
as he lead the way, 
to a world where King's and Queens, 
are Monarch's every day. 

I was  given a crown to wear
or a Halo known by some. 
The difference is up here, 
they are worn by everyone. 

I felt a sense of peace, 
my reign had seen its end. 
70 years I had served my Country, 
as the peoples friend. 

Thank you for the years, 
for all your time and love.

Poroshenko was holding an assault rifle and has apparently taken command of a volunteer battalion.

After that, the CNN caster asked Poroshenko how long he thought they could hold out.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

hmwhd7,"Basically, [produce and disseminate lies faster than they can be addressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firehose_of_falsehood).  

Flood the media, never let up.  Never give anyone a chance to marinate on how something makes no sense - always re-steal the spotlight with The Next Stupid Thing™.   Even if the next thing is a scandal that would make your candidate look bad, it doesn't matter because it distracts from the current thing, and the next thing is already on it's way. 

All the while screaming Fake News at literally everything until no one takes anything seriously anymore.   

It works because you end up with one position that seems super confident and is charging ahead with... _something_, and the other side is always busy debunking and defending, so they seem like they are not sure what's going on.  

People tend to vote for the stronger side, and the side holding the firehose looks stronger.  

It's as effective as it is cynical.

That's all my editorializing, but here is a relevant quotation from the wiki: 

> Lenin once explained that his heated language was ""calculated not to convince, but to break up the ranks of the opponent, not to correct the mistake of the opponent, but to destroy him, to wipe his organization off the face of the earth."" In his biography of Lenin, historian Victor Sebestyen described him as the ""godfather"" of ""post-truth politics.""

[health vs military spending](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/what-do-countries-spend-on-healthcare-versus-military/)

Public mentality is a big problem for the US.

If US politicians decided looking after their population was more important than getting personal kickbacks from big pharma perhaps we would see some laws helping protect the people.

The amount you spend on something means nothing if you allow the price to be set to insane levels. If healthcare costs 1/10 for the same service the money being spent goes much further. Sounds pretty simple right? 

The problem is not the military, it's how money is being spent on healthcare and being squandered away to insurance and big pharma.

“The contract has already been paid for LOL idiots” Yes you are right.  But I still signed the petition (even though it’s also not a proper petition) because I saw it, because other people saw it too, because the most important thing about the petition isn’t actually selling the fireworks and shoving cash into firefighters hands, it’s telling our government that we don’t give a shit about this when the government is ignoring our country that is on fire. I live rurally and would have lost my home if not for firefighters.


I am seeing a lot of shit here about people being so much smarter and understanding economics than the rest of us morons with a single digit IQ who are trying to bring attention to the fact that OUR FIREFIGHTER ARE NOT BEING PAID FOR THE LITERAL LIFE SAVING/HOME SAVING/COUNTRY SAVING THEY ARE DOING.


Also a reminder that it’s not like we spend $6 Million on a firework show and if the world likes it they give us $140 Million. If I spent $200 at a hotel and $100 eating out while at the fireworks, the fireworks brought in $300. Now you see how that can not be used TO PAY OUR FIRE FIGHTERS.


Instead of repeating over and over again about how ‘wrong’ these people who care are. How about all the economical geniuses here help find a way WE CAN PAY OUR FIRE FIGHTERS!! I personally (I understand if you don’t agree with this last part) would rather, as little as that money is in the scheme of things, that the money go to the firefighters pocket’s than what the profits would bring to a company’s till.


Edit: Also even if the extreme happens (which it won’t and I don’t think should - considering how close it is to the day) SYDNEY WILL BE FUCKING FINE. Do you really think that Sydney is gonna have to shut off the lights if they cancelled this?

i0ufzr,"Any evidence of any of what you’re claiming happening? Of China leveraging their economic position to manipulate countries into signing a document? Or is this just justified because “China bad”. 

In that same vein (except mine is actually substantiated) America has a long history of making up BS (WMDs, ripping babies from incubators, etc.) about rival countries. According to your own logic we should just dismiss them out of hand because of that 😂 

Do you have a list of the countries who are supposedly opposed to these vocational centers that outnumbers the western countries? 

And “human rights violations”. Fucking hilarious considering all the western nations who signed the letter against the Xinjiang centers. 

Here’s some facts. 

>Mumtaz Baloch was part of a group of diplomats from 12 countries that visited Urumqi, Kashgar, and Hotan in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region last month.

>...

>”During the visit, we had the opportunity to visit the Xinjiang Islamic Institute, the bazaars, mosques, police stations, economic development, and poverty alleviation projects and vocational education and training centers,” she added.

>She said the diplomats were given full and open access to the three centers that they visited in Kashgar and Hotan.
The training program includes the teaching of national common language (Chinese), law and constitution and vocational skills. The students also participate in recreational activities like sports, music, and dance. The diplomats witnessed several skill classes being offered in these centers.

>”We had the opportunity to interact with both the management and the students. We observed the students are in good physical health. The living facilities are fairly modern and comfortable with separate dormitories for men and women. They are being served halal food.”

>To yet another question, she said, “I did not find any instance of forced labor or cultural and religious repression. The imams we met at the mosques and the students and teachers at the Xinjiang Islamic Institute told us that they enjoy freedom in practicing Islam and that the Chinese government extends support for maintenance of mosques all over Xinjiang.

>I learned that there are over 30,000 mosques all over Xinjiang that form part of the religious life of the people there.”
Mumtaz Baloch said similarly she did not see any sign of cultural repression. The Uyghur culture as demonstrated by their language, music, and dance is very much part of the life of the people of Xinjiang.

>The most visible sign of protection of Uyghur culture by the government is the government-run bilingual kindergarten schools where children learn Putonghua as well as Uyghur language and culture from a very young age.

>The World Bank today released the following statement on its recently concluded review of a project in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China:

>”The World Bank’s work is driven by core principles of inclusion, with special consideration for the protection of minorities and other vulnerable peoples.  When allegations are made, the World Bank takes them seriously and reviews them thoroughly.  In line with standard practice, immediately after receiving a series of serious allegations in August 2019 in connection with the Xinjiang Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project, the Bank launched a fact-finding review, and World Bank senior managers traveled to Xinjiang to gather information directly. After receiving the allegations, no disbursements were made on the project. 

>The team conducted a thorough review of project documents, engaged in discussions with project staff, and visited schools directly financed by the project, as well as their partner schools that were the subject of allegations. The review did not substantiate the allegations.

https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/statement/2019/11/11/world-bank-statement-on-review-of-project-in-xinjiang-china

Also I mistyped when I said 22. It’s 23 **including the US**. Not sure why you’d use outdated information to “substantiate” your argument.

https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/asia/china-xinjiang-united-nations-intl-hnk/index.html

Yeah I agree. We should get the facts straight.

EDIT: Also imagine believing that 43 countries explicitly endorsing the Xinjiang rehabilitation and vocational training centers believe there’s a genocide going on because... why exactly? Are you a mind reader?",2020-07-31 07:34:58
i0ufzr,"> The one-child policy has been abolished (replaced with a two-child policy, which has allegedly been abolished in 2018, after which there is supposedly no longer any law preventing Han Chinese from having bigger families)

Alleged... by whom? Your entire position is based on *allegations* and *suppositions* that are [factually incorrect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5944611/). There is nothing that confirms the two-child policy has been abolished.

>In what way is China ""forcing"" birth control on it's Han population the same way it's forcing birth control on Uyghurs?

In the [exact same way it's ""forcing"" birth control on Uyghurs](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-114hhrg98715/html/CHRG-114hhrg98715.htm):

>>The two-child policy will not end any of the human rights 
abuses that were caused by the one-child policy, including 
forced abortions, forced sterilizations as well as the sex-
selective abortion of baby girls.

Yeah, they've been doing that to the Han for 30+ years, yet when the same policy is applied to the Uyghur it's suddenly ""demographic genocide""? So in what way specifically is birth control being ""forced"" on the Uyghur that is not also being ""forced"" on the Han?

>On top of that, Han people in Xinjiang have been incentivized since 2012 to have two children, during which the government already introduced measures to curb Uyghur population growth.

Yes, you see, when the policy is for everyone to have two children, and demographic X tends to have less than 2 children, whereas demographic Y tends to have more than 2 children, then to make everyone have 2 children one must incentivise demographic X to have more children and disincentivise the childbirths in demographic Y. Shocking abuse of human rights! ""Demographic genocide""!

>recently it has taken [new, draconian steps to further curb the growth of the Uyghur population](https://apnews.com/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c).

>>After Gulnar Omirzakh, a Chinese-born Kazakh, had her third child, the government ordered her to get an IUD inserted.

So the ""new, draconian steps"" is just... IUDs when you have more than the legally allowed number of children? [Where have I heard that before](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-114hhrg98715/html/CHRG-114hhrg98715.htm)?

>>In Junan Commune, located in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong 
province, where I did my original field research in China, these were 
the years in which virtually every women of childbearing age with three 
or more living children was either inserted with an IUD, or given a 
tubal ligation.

So when a woman in Uyghur violates the population control laws that apply to all Chinese, she gets the exact same treatment as Han women in Guangdong? This is what you mean when you say ""new, draconian steps"" that constitute ""demographic genocide""? Which, by the way, are the [exact same population control method used in other countries as well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-child_policy#Iran)? 🤔",2020-08-01 09:29:46

7em7xi,FIFA and EA 🤔 two criminal organisations.🧐,2017-11-22 03:15:19
7em7xi,"Yes.

Because if you take away the virtual item veil, it can be easily translated to: Input $1.00 for a potential of $1,000.00 (or more). 


I know this isn't how LoL works exactly, but let me try to lay it out using that as an example: Lets say you get a bunch of loot boxes & keys on your account - you spent a total of $100.00. You unlock all your boxes and !!! woah! You got a super rare discontinued Jax skin that only 10 other people have. You look up how much your account is worth now - !!! woah! Now it's worth $3,000.00. Or...let's assume you didn't get anything. But you are soooo sure that you can get that rare skin so you spend $100's and $100's of dollars on it, you start becoming obsessed with getting that skin because surely if you just could get that skin you could stop spending so much money and you could just quit and be happy with the game and then one day - YES! You did it! $15,000 later, ruined friendships, lost time, and it turns out you get extremely depressed because that skin that was worth $3,000 is now only worth $5 because the creators of the game flooded the market to discourage the black market.

edit: Like I said, LoL was a bad example, but the general idea is that this sort of thing can cause people (children especially) to learn extremely dangerous spending habits. 

edit 2: Everyone is bringing up the idea that your account will be banned if you trade it. I have bought and sold accounts from many games in the past, never had them banned. That doesn't happen often. Virtual item sales are a huge market. 

edit 3: This has created quite a large discussion, of which many people have made great points. The main question was simply : Are games that offer loot chest (like CS:GO, LoL, etc) also participating in gambling? Of which I replied Yes. **of course** there is the loophole that allows it to happen because everyone technically gets something, and people are also making the case that it is similar to trading card games - I totally agree. However I also believe that it's (as I put it earlier) Gambling-lite®. Conditioning kids to love that dopamine hit from getting pack after pack after pack and then FINALLY YES A CHARIZARD. Now I must get 1,000 MORE packs because I hit that 1:1000 chance of getting it. Same shit with OSRS. People spend days and days grinding that game just to HOPEFULLY hit that RNGJesus. 

edit 4: The main issue I have with this is that yes - if you are an adult and you want to spend $15,000 on anything, that's your prerogative. The issue comes in the form of children who play these games who may not know the value of a dollar and blow their parents/their own money on it, which can lead to issues with budgeting in the future. 

final edit: I do not really believe that loot crates are an issue. I enjoy earning little boxes of goodies from playing, and I enjoy what I get out of them. My only concern is that you can pay real money to get them, and that adds an entirely different angle to the entire thing. Loot boxes are harmless - you get rewards for playing - but when you tie them to money...it's a new beast. ",2017-11-22 00:38:21

l7xe41,"I added my name to the letter back in October.  It's taken far too long for this to be picked up by the press here.  I have a super massive module (1700 students) that the academics wrote the textbook for.  It's a fairly well used one in the UK.  We can only get it via Kortext, so have had to pay for the equivalent of a copy of each student.  One course, one book cost us a heavily discounted £19k.  That's only to rent it for the year though.

Have had fun this week with students doing open book exams, where they can't get into their textbook as the publisher has stupidly expensive licences.  We'd have to pay approx. £100k for about 35 titles. 

McGraw Hill, Oxford University Publishing, Pearson, the bigger academic publishers are the worst for this.  Trying to sort out problems caused by this has pretty much doubled my workload this year 😞.",2021-01-29 22:58:35

I had a professor once that required us to purchase a Virginia history book and he was the damn author 😑 the only place we could buy it was the  publishers website, so no way to rent. Additionally, we should be talking about how much more effing expensive taking an online course is.. typically several hundred dollars more than in-class education. My experience has been that most of the online courses i took the professors were difficult to get ahold of and late to grade or give feed back. It’s a fucking scam. In my experience while looking for jobs as a senior in college I’m seeing most entry level jobs or jobs with (barely)livable wages basically require a Bachelors degree. Even with a full pell grant and federal loans, I can’t even cover how much my tuition and books and bs fees and unless you have perfect credit you aren’t getting private loans..

“Rothermere visited and corresponded with Hitler on multiple occasions, such as after the 1930 elections that saw the Nazi Party dramatically increase its seats in the Reichstag, which Rothermere welcomed.[10] In gratitude for this foreign support, Hitler granted Rothermere an exclusive interview.[10] On another occasion, On 1 October 1938, Rothermere sent Hitler a telegram in support of Germany's invasion of the Sudetenland, and expressing the hope that ""Adolf the Great"" would become a popular figure in Britain.” 😒☹️",2020-04-04 14:06:38

But yeah, education is surely affordable on that budget.

Even if you get a good deal on insurance through your job and only pay $800/month in rent because you found roommates, it's still not a livable wage. You're completely out of touch and just hate the idea because ""radical left democrats^^TM "" are proposing it.

There comes a point when when Folks have to take a stand.

They are risking it all with this one act - imprisonment, murder, torture, disappearance.

I know I'm probably just dreaming, but.........

It would be good if, while the Russian Government has all of these Troops and shit in Ukraine, that ALL other Autonomous Regions (and others) in Russia decide *en masse* that they want to break away from Autocratic rule and act on it.

*All at the same time.*

*Make Destabilization and the resultant Chaos work for you as a People.*

Russia is an enormous Country and that may work in their favor.

It's not that they can't do it - they just have to figure out *how,* especially getting the Police and Military on their side - they are Russians, too.

I doubt if China will do anything about it - there would be nothing in it for her and in the Chaos she might seek to gain disputed Territory, thereby causing more Chaos with Putin and in the process making him look real stupid.

It broke my heart when an old Russian friend of mine voiced his support for the invasion before our final argument... felt like I suddenly didn't know him & that he had been twisted into something hateful, entitled, and domineering ... perhaps he always was this way, perhaps not. He seemed so good...

We can have an honest, disagreeing conversation re: how to approach the status of Lugansk/Crimea/Donetsk within Ukraine (always within the context of UKR democracy, constitution, and legal process - as they are regions within UKR)  -  but **support for any war/violence is crossing a red line.** I'm so glad other Russians are resisting. I wish my old friend would have been there among them, not that I ever would want him to get hurt - but at some level, Russians need to take responsibility for their country's actions & overthrow Putin (even if Putin is a dictator, his state is built out of millions of individuals which make daily choices to continue his regime). Ukrainians successfully revolted against the Berkut & Yanukovic w near-impossible odds back in 2014... when will the Russians do the same?

Putin =/= all Russians, but fuck this war... we need to see mass civil disobedience soon or an overthrow. I am under no misconceptions that these things are easy or come without enormous sacrifice (especially compared w anyone living the N.American experience)... but the sacrifices Ukrainians have made are inhumanly tragic. At this rate, we all (NATO countries) may one day be forced to offer these sacrifices in fighting against Putin's Russian Federation... unless Russians organize & step up.

ktxv9e,"Whilst the president may appoint the chief justice that doesn't mean he can appoint anyone. 
He has to hear recommendations from the Judicial Service Council (a highly independant panel)  and Parliament. He may choose to not follow their advice but his choice of chief justice would be eligible for rationality review (a tool that often stopped Zuma and from an area of law that is very highly developed in SA compared to the rest of the world). He does not have to pick the strongest candidate but he most likely cannot pick one of the weakast or one who is not ""fit and proper"" or even one that is an irrational pick due to him/her not being in line with the values of the constitution/judiciary.


With that said, it is 100% COMPLETELY wrong in saying a poor choice of Chief Justice contributed to corruption significantly. Zuma corrupted the National Prosecuting Authority and disbanded the Scorpions to prevent his prosecution. The Chief Justice does not have much say over them as that is the Minister of Justices job. Thus, no significant corruption cases even reached the Constitutional Court during State Capture where a chief justice would have to rule on them and even if they did the chief justice sits on a panel of 8 judges all with equal weighting.

South Africa's judiciary is very strong. It is the strongest part of the state. Unless you study the cases you will never realise how much the courts have prevented during state capture days. Our prosecution capacity was weak and nearly non-existent but the NPA and Hawks have been stepping up in 2020. It will take a few more years to build full institutional capacity and strength in the NPA and Hawks but the current teams that are prosecuting the state capture / Zuma Era corruption cases are going to be battle hardened as fuck. I can nealry guarantee you that if the USA decides to prosecute Trump they will seek at least some advice from us about how we have gone about prosecuting stage capture. 

BTW, check out how the USA appoints its SCA judges if you think SA's method is bad 😉",2021-01-09 23:30:12

Like the US is already too broken to be fixed with a single issue, the description you meant for SA is almost mirrored in its entirety with the USA.

os26dl,"OK I’ve only read the first sentence of your comment so far and i had to say I was dying laughing. So far you seem like a funny person so I hope you don’t ruin it. I’m gonna go finish the comment and I’ll be back. 

OK I just finished and I’m back. You actually made some good points and you didn’t come off as a violent hateful person because i disagree with you. 

So first of all I was just using an average when I said snapping a woman in half. The average man is much stronger and faster than the average woman. Yes there are plenty of women I could kick my ass and beat me in sports but I’m talking about average. 

You are correct the trans women compete and it has not been a problem but in my opinion that is because there haven’t been enough cases. When you have 10,000 matches of a sport and only two of them were performed by trans women of course the chances are lower. 

When it comes to sports men are better than women at every single sport in history . I’m not being sexist I’m being factual. Obviously that is mostly due to the fact that they have athletic advantages. I can’t answer why but i find it interesting that even in sports that require no athletic ability, men are usually better. Who is the fastest mathematician? Who is the best Rubiks cube person? Best video gamer? Chess champion? I don’t even know but I’m assuming they are men? 

Humans are the only species that we have decided can just randomly change sexes. If I sold you a female cat that  started pissing all over your furniture you would call me back and say hey buddy you sold me a fucking male cat. I say no I cut his balls he’s a female. 

If I cut my arms off and told you I was a dolphin you would have me locked up but if I want to cut my penis off and call myself a woman then you’re like OK that’s pretty cool. 

I’m not against trans people I don’t give a shit what they do. I have friends that are gay and one that became trans. I told him straight up ” you can call yourself whatever you want but you’re not gonna force me to change my mind and believe something that isn’t real. you’re a fucking guy and just because you feel like you’re a girl doesn’t mean you’re a girl. I’ll call you the name you prefer when you’re in front of people but it’s only out of respect for you not because I believe it.”  He’s one of my best friends and I go out with his trans friends all the time and I bust their  balls and they bust my balls back. I can say “don’t be such a fag” and they understand by the tone of my voice how I mean it. My point is that we can all be friends without forcing our ideas on each other.

Obviously (and sadly) there were plenty of people who assumed she was incompetent by sheer virtue of being female, and others who probably thought her nationality or ethnicity were grounds enough to assume culpability, but doesn't the fact that people produced fake headlines / mash-ups and fake profiles show that this was a story designed deliberately to stir up the sexists / misogynists / racists (and their ideological opponents) in the first place?    


I feel like the whole world is on the receiving end of a co-ordinated and deliberate disinformation campaign designed to sow mistrust and undermine unity and this is just one more example of that (other examples include Brexit & the 2016 US Presidential election, all things Covid-hoax, etc etc).

hwnu2o,"Okay, give me a moment. 

During lockdown? I smoked weed and played video games. Mowed my lawn. Girlfriend made bread (bloody good bread too)

There was a hold on people being evicted from homes and most business got a govt wage package that ensured they can pay their staff at least 80% of their wages while locked down. The business has to prove they were going to take a 30% or more hit during lockdown. The company I worked for payed me full wages with commission during the lockdown and they gave back the subsidy to the govt because we actually GREW during the pandemic. 

So people continued getting their wages, courtesy of the govt. (Businesses have to pay it back)

Beneficiaries got an increase to their weekly payments I believe. 

For groceries, only one person per household was allowed to go out the supermarket and only once a week. It had to be the same supermarket everytime too. (These were all guidelines the govt set out and everyone followed it, as they couldn't lawfully arrest people for not following them)

Everything was shut...no restaurants, no pubs, nothing. Only essential services were still active like groceries, petrol stations etc. Some technology retail stores stayed open via online orders only as people needed monitors and webcams for working at home. I work in logistics so I was an essential worker towards the end of the lockdown when we went into level 3. 

Once the lockdown stopped and we moved into level 3, some services opened up. People could come and pick up their orders from us but they needed to stay behind a plexi glass gate to collect their item and wear a mask while social distancing. Our workplace provided us lots of PPE. 

Once we went to level one (which we are currently in) life literally went back to normal. I'm sitting at a bar right now typing this with thousands of people walking around town doing their thing like nothing happened. 

As others have mentioned, covid and the lockdown are almost distant memories now. It's nostalgic to talk about what you did during lockdown. 

So yea...the govt said, have 4 weeks payed leave and everyone said ""okay 👍""

Edit: I may be corrected about the wages part, it was kind of complicated on paper.",2020-07-24 06:12:17

Fast forward 20 years later and divorced we found each other again and now we've been together for the last 4 years and will be getting married. I was mature enough to give consent. However, there should be an age gap limit. 3 years difference meant I was a freshman and he was a senior in high school. Personally I think 14 is fine but limit the gap because it's not the same as a 14 year old girl or boy getting groomed by a 30-40 year old. 🤮",2020-11-28 17:37:14

Like, who gives a fuck what any psychiatrist says. A child having sexual relations with an adult is fucked up. For a system to have “exceptions” just because a psychiatrist says they are “developed enough” seems insanely fucked up to me. 

It’s unsettling how many people think it’s okay. 

Imagine If YOUR 14 year old child had sex with a 40 year old, and because a psychiatrist says they are mentally developed enough, the guy gets off.

b06hmk,"Dude, you're literally a risk as long as thre's a chance you have diseases in your system that maybe you are strong enough to combat, but which still use your body to travel and breed.  They can still spread to infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromized.  Just because you don't actually get symptoms from something in your body, doesn't mean it's not still in you and ready to infect the next vulnerable person.  

I acknowledged I drove in the comment you're replying to.  Did you read it?

You can't catch or get autism.  You happen to be speaking to someone who has autism, who have friends who are vaccinated and unvaccinated who have autism, and who does work in the autism self-advocacy community.  Good luck convincing me autism is some kind of diease you can catch.  You're born with it.  That's like saying your computer can catch Mac when you bought it as a Windows.  And I'm honestly tired of having this conversation where I am told my brain has a disease when it 100% does not.  You don't get to call my in-born neuro-psychological disability an illness and act like it's something you can ""get.""  And I am going to save you time by telling you that you are not going to convince me, an Autistic™, anything otherwise. So save that.

I will admit you have a point with that last one, but only because we know that vaccines have caused diseases to evolve faster and into more complex forms to fight back against said vaccines.  For that, the only solution I would know of would be to keep taking the updated, most recent vaccine.  Which is already suggested by doctors specifically because we know that this happens.  Not vaccinating isn't an effective solution when, again, you put the lives of vulnerable people at risk by allowing yourself to carry these germs with you unhindered. 

EDIT: What did you mean by; ""Sorry I assumed you drove cars (texting , talking on phone). Mutual risk taking? Pedestrians.""

Maybe you talk on the phone or text while driving, but I certainly don't.  I obey the rules of the road and pay attention so that I don't become a danger to said pedestrians.  Those pedestrians and I, by being in the social contract we are in by default, agree to respect each other's space.  They will use the cross walk or look both ways, and I will stop for them and obey the traffic laws that keep them and myself safe.

And like I said.  Those are risks, be they risks or not, that I have consented to.  Can you name a risk I take regularly that I do not consent to taking beforehand?  or are you just making assumptions?

t3elvw,"But all of the other stories he referred I already have seen verified to be fake, at least in some manner. It wasn't misinformation at all...??? 🙄

Reddit is becoming as bad as Russian state media as far as pushing a narrative about this war goes lmao. Ghost of Ukraine was unverified and no credible news agency will touch the story, Snake Island guys are now confirmed to be alive. The tank running over a car was definitely a friendly fire accident as that was an Ukrainian surface-to-air missile system under heavy enemy fire, lost from his squad and on wet roads. The only one that didn't have a source was the grandma confronting the soldier.

Ukranians have as much of a vested interest in pushing propaganda as the Russians, so it's important not to invest yourself too heavily on one side of the conflict or else you'll get tunnel vision. I guess it's important for the morale of Ukraine to have these kind of stories, but it's totally pointless for a bunch of dorky redditors playing armchair general to aggregate the misinformation further. There's absolutely no reason to censor a guy for pointing out Reddit's probably with spreading fake narratives when they get too invested in a world event.

pjthms,Hello. Idk where you live but if you live anywhere near a major university they will more than likely have a dental school that does dental work for a fraction of what a private dentist would cost. Even with out insurance it'd like be 50-75% the cost of going to a private practice. I had a broken tooth in my 20s and a wisdom tooth removed by dental students who were supervised by a licensed dentist/professor. What would have been a $5000 with insurance bill cost me just under $900 without insurance. Might be something you could look into if your teeth are starting to break up. Good luck. 👍,2021-09-07 20:54:56
pjthms,"> You support zero rights for unborn children.

It’s not anything. Sure, at a certain point a fetus becomes a baby, but in the early stages of pregnancy, where an abortion is most likely to occur, we’re not talking about killing a baby. We’re talking about removing what amounts to a blob of cellular material.

It doesn’t matter… I’m sure I can’t change your mind and you certainly won’t change mine. At the end of the day one group of people supports a living breathing woman’s right to her own body and the other thinks the rights of an unconscious assortment of cells is more important than those of the woman who’s carrying said cells regardless of whether or not the woman was raped or if the pregnancy poses a threat to her life 🤷‍♂️",2021-09-07 21:40:34
pjthms,"My bottoms were partially erupted and “not an issue” for years, which let me make excuses, then one night my jaw was a little sore, ate a slice of pizza, swallowing what felt unlike pizza and realizing my entire molar in front of the wisdom tooth is now my dinner.

pjthms,"Butthurt for explaining the reasoning for my answer? Try harder. 

Dude, hire whoever you want. I don't care. But you get what you pay for. Law school doesn't teach someone how to be a lawyer. It teaches them the law. If you think passing the bar makes a lawyer good, far be it from me to remove your suspension of disbelief. Just hope the other side doesn't pay for a quality lawyer. 🤷‍♂️",2021-09-07 21:03:33
pjthms,"But having a surgery, and the risk for infection, how is a tourist supposed to know? You hope the dr is using sterile saline but there is no way to know for sure. And how could you know if the cisterns are up to date? To be fair, , Mexico does some nice dental work, but I have seen some horrendous dentistry from China, India , and other countries. There is no recourse if your implant gets infected and you can’t afford to go back to the county and deal with their legal system there. Just saying flossing is cheap and keeps you out of the dental chair for the most part. With the exception of the elderly on drugs that diminish salivary flow, that allows for bacteria to flourish and decay to run rampant.

Their criticism is about the validity of the medical data, and I have not disputed the data coming from The Lancet that Guttmacher used. Guttmacher did, however, misinterpret the data.

It should also be noted that your PDF rebuttal is from 2012, whereas the Guttmacher article you linked to, and that I was criticizing, is from 2020. You linked to a rebuttal about something else.

t0ttcq,"1944, Battle of the Bulge and the Germans break American lines. Americans send in the 101st and they become surrounded in the city of Bastogne, Belgium. They’re essentially in an Alamo situation and the Nazis send a message to commanding officer General Anthony McAuliffe: 

“To the U.S.A. Commander of the encircled town of Bastogne.
The fortune of war is changing. This time the U.S.A. forces in and near Bastogne have been encircled by strong German armored units. More German armored units have crossed the river Ourthe near Ortheuville, have taken Marche and reached St. Hubert by passing through Hompre-Sibret-Tillet. Libramont is in German hands.
There is only one possibility to save the encircled U.S.A. troops from total annihilation: that is the honorable surrender of the encircled town. In order to think it over a term of two hours will be granted beginning with the presentation of this note.
If this proposal should be rejected one German Artillery Corps and six heavy A. A. Battalions are ready to annihilate the U.S.A. troops in and near Bastogne. The order for firing will be given immediately after this two hours term.
All the serious civilian losses caused by this artillery fire would not correspond with the well-known American humanity.
The German Commander.”

General McAuliffe’s reply was a little shorter:

“To the German Commander.
NUTS!
The American Commander.”

Winter it's something like.. 7:30am sunrise and it's pretty dark before 4pm ( proper sunset probably a little after but it didn't matter)

And then I got hayfever for the first time in my life 👌 

Edit; just googled to double check

Apparently 8:30am sunrise, 6:08pm sunset, 9:38min of sublight

It's a bit bullshit as Melbourne has a pretty long twilight, and in summer that means brightness for 2 hours, but in winter it's dark as fuck waaaay before official sunset. Nowhere near 9.5hrs of sun.

Also think those times maybe with daylight savings right now, 7:30am sunrise is about right.

Edit2: same goes for summer, the latest official sunset in Jan appears to be around 8:36pm. In reality there's a LOT of daylight left around 10:30-11pm but I guess the sun is officially below whatever threshold means sunset lol.",2019-11-03 17:23:39

Just wear a fucking mask.

Even the lunacy that is anti-vax seems sane in comparison, because at least there I can sort of understand why some people fear putting chemicals into their body that they don't quite understand and have been told could be harmful. 

Here you're covering your face with a piece of fucking fabric. It's not even like anyone's policing the KIND of mask you wear. So even if you're one of these people convinced that a mask somehow makes it hard to breathe with your asthma (which is a load of horseshit to begin with) - just get a mask that's looser fitting. It's still better than nothing.

Those of us with glasses probably have it the worst. Every trip out, my glasses fog up so much, it feels like I'm playing as Stevie Wonder in VR. Yet you don't see me complaining, because there's a fucking pandemic, and people are dying, and there's bigger issues than a little bit of comfort when out and about.

k0j2lh,">Second, the other major thing that really separates Protestants and Catholics is the Eucharist. Or communion. Basically, the part of church where bread and wine is ""handed out."" From what I understand, for Protestants, it is purely symbolic. However, for Catholics, the bread actually becomes the body of Christ, and the wine actually becomes the blood of Christ.

And then you get the Anglican/Episcopal crowd complicating the transubstantiation vs. consubstantiation question. 😁 You're welcome!

There's a LOT happening in that Catholic/Protestant split. Like you said, this is the surface, but it's really interesting to trace the family tree in Christianity and see who splits off where, when, and why.

And this is without talking about the Orthodox side of things, with the ""filiaque"" debate, or the uniquely American branches that really weren't protesting in quite the same way...

Yes and no. I was taught as part of our Catechism that we (Episcopalians) do have seven sacraments as well, which puts us at odds with most other Protestant denominations.

The Catholic Church may say otherwise about our sacraments, but then again, they don't see us as real transubstantiationalists as well, so 🤷‍♀️. Even we can't exactly give a straight answer on that one.",2020-11-25 05:51:29

7i4o84,"No it is actually a lot different. You’re talking about physically restricting where a person is allowed to go. Gay people were never specifically restricted from marriage, it was just never intended for them in the first place. No rights were ever taken away from them, it’s only now that people are screaming ‘inequality’ that people are shoving these ‘rights’ onto them... 

Like I said I believe they deserve the same financial and legal rights, but not the right to ‘marriage’ which is specifically reserved for a man and a woman. 

Ok you know what this is basically arguing semantics, I’m happy that gay people have equal rights (I personally think it should’ve came in a different way but whatever, that’s not the important part, this is definitely a better alternative to gay people continuing to not have the same rights) but the important part I’m not happy at is the general public’s POV which I think is completely askew, for reasons stated above. 

I think this is the part where we can all go our seperate ways and accept our differences 😂 if you still feel offended by my opinion, feel free to let me know/try argue or discuss if you want, but I can’t really think of anything else I can add to this apart from what I’ve already said ",2017-12-07 09:05:41

7i4o84,"Lol. You were believable until you went into that false fact filled rant defending Roy Moore.

[The mountain of evidence against Roy Moore.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/11/the_mountain_of_evidence_against_roy_moore.html)  legal documents confirm the girl and her mother were right down the hall from Moore’s office the day she says Moore met her daughter. 

And you do realize all i had to do was check your Comment history to see you post regularly in the_donald? Nobody who isn’t a conservative is even allowed there without instant bans.  How dumb do you think people are?

Nobody who isn’t a conservative believes a word of what you claimed about that situation. These allegations stretch back 30 years. When you’re thirty and trying to fuck a 14 yr old, you’re clearly a child molester.

The mall cops were specifically told to keep him from kids. The 14 year old he was dating was literally a life long republican voter whrn she came forward. The other women all had people who vouched for them from the beginning who knew what had happened when it began.

They’ve more than attempted to prove the claims. The fact is that Alabama voters are so insane they literally tell pollsters they don’t give a damn who he molested. They’d still elect him over a ‘demon-crat’. 🙄🙄

And the foundation of marriage? It was literally a property contract for men to own their wives’ property and control them.  The whole handoff from father to husband isn’t about anything other than ‘here’ you own her now’.  

Women couldn’t even own their own property when marriage was invented.  If you raped a woman, you paid her family a fine for the lost value. What does that sound like? It sure isn’t holiness. ",2017-12-07 16:14:00

fkmdvd,"They are basing their response on Singapore’s, which is controlling the situation well and kept schools open. There is a scientific basis to it - short term closures simply don’t help stop the spread, and children are an incredibly low risk group - in that regard the virus is not like influenza, it doesnt seem to want hurt kids 😂. Basically at school and away from adults is a safe place for kids (exaggerating a fair bit, but still) Singapore is doing other measures such as thermal scanning kids for fever, which might be a good thing to do here. It’s important to note how very few of our cases have been through community spread.

The other reason was economic - an extended schools closure of say 14 weeks might have some impact on the spread, but would likely require teachers to be furloughed or fired, which given the relatively low risk.

It might seem insane on the surface, but it is probably the right response for now, and seems to be what all health experts are recommending. If the situation changes, schools can be closed.

A Quick Guide to ""Net Neutrality""

Small note:

Don't let people sell you on the CONCEPT of Net Neutrality. We're talking actual regulation. The concept is great. But the actual regulation is what we're focused on.

Net Neutrality in concept, is great. 

Net Neutrality's actual regulation, is antithetical to the concept. 

EXISTING LAW: 👎

What the FCC is calling ""Net Neutrality"" is actually just a massive regulatory move that will give the FCC extremely high control and authority over what kinds of communication are allowed and disallowed on the (until now) open internet. Let's not forget the FCC's horrible track record on our First Amendment rights.

>(a) Whoever-- (1) in interstate or foreign communications-- (A) by means of a telecommunications device knowingly-- (i) makes, creates, or solicits, and (ii) initiates the transmission of, any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person;

...

>(C) makes a telephone call or utilizes a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communications;

The censorship portion of the Law is under Section 223. 

>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under his control to be used for any activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for such activity, shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_United_States

Notice how the pro-Net Neutrality people always talk about the possibility that Comcast or Verizon will ""censor"" certain content. What they fail to mention is that the Law that the FCC reinterpreted and applied to ISPs in 2015 and called ""Net Neutrality"" actually contains obscenity laws and speech codes that explicitly censor ""obscene"" or ""annoying"" content. What the FCC is calling ""Net Neutrality"" is actually just a massive regulatory move that will give the FCC extremely high control and authority over what kinds of communication are allowed and disallowed on the (until now) open internet.

_________________________

PROPOSED LAW:👍

FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177 

Restoring FTC jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651

Direct quote from the FCC release, p.83

[https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf]

1. Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508

(FCC release p.82):

The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502 The FTC also requires the “disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.”503

ISPs cannot conspire to restrict the internet in any way. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)

1. Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.518

UNLIMITED NETFLIX

If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing “Over the Top” video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure. 

Nice little little burn against Obama & The Globalist Friendship Squad.

1. We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved “laying claim to extravagant statutory power over the national economy ...""

FCC reserves the right to return to Title II (Net Neutrality) regulations if ISP fuckers get uppity

176.We also reject AT&T’s assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.647 Although AT&T explains that “conditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a ‘common carrier’ classification,”648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary.

🛑My own personal, quick conclusion:🛑

Net Neutrality (the regulation) allowed censorship and was a huge subsidy factory that picked winners and consolidated the market. 

Sure, it ""aided"" in distribution of service to more rural areas. Trouble is, they're the only show in town now. 

As far as the new proposal goes, IT WILL STILL BE ILLEGAL TO THROTTLE OR RESTRICT SERVICE.

> They may re-establish contact, or may dissipate under an attack, and even the commanders don’t know how many are dead, injured, or captured. Total dead is definitely in the thousands, maybe 10,000, maybe 5,000, or maybe just 2,000.
> 
> But even at our command no one knows. But probably closer to 10,000 Russian soldiers killed. And we are not counting losses at DNR & LNR.
> 
> Now even we kill Zelensky or take him prisoner, nothing will change. The level of hate toward us is similar to Chechnya. And now, even those loyal to us in Ukraine are publicly against us.
> 
> Because all of this was planned at the top (in Russia), because we were told that such a scenario will not happen (Ukraine invasion) except only if we were to be attacked first.
> 
> Because we were told that we need to maximize our threats in order to negotiate an outcome through peace. Because we were already preparing protests against Zelensky in Ukraine without ever considering invading Ukraine.
> Now, civilian losses in Ukraine will follow a geometric pattern progression, and resistance against us will only get stronger. Infantries already tried to enter cities – out of 20 paratrooper groups, only one had “provisional” success.
> 
> Recall the invasion of Mosul. It’s a rule – happens with every country, nothing new. To siege? Over the last decades in Europe – Serbia being the best example, cities can remain functional under siege for years. Humanitarian convoys from Europe to Ukraine is only a matter of time
> 
> Our conditional deadline is June. Conditional because in June there will be no economy left in Russia – there will be nothing left.
> 
> By and large, next week there will be a collapse (in Russia) to either of the two sides (for vs against war), simply because current tension (in Russia) is unsustainable.
> 
> We have no analyses, we can’t make any forecasts in this chaos, no one will be able to say anything with any certainty (in Russia).

While it is no secret our launch of RU-2.0 failed to meet expectations, we had hoped that a few subsequent updates from our dedicated and talented team would be a real knock-out punch. After much deliberation among team members and the board, we have decided to roll back our RU-2.0 launch and issue refunds to those who purchased it. For now, we will be going dark while we get down to business and stay hard at work to deliver the international community a Russian experience they will enjoy and never forget!""

## Altruism and politics

📷 Cromwell House, [Mortlake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortlake), where Colston died in 1721 

He supported and endowed schools, almshouses, hospitals and churches  in Bristol, London and elsewhere. Many of his charitable foundations  survive to this day.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Colston#cite_note-:0-1) 

In [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol), he founded [almshouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almshouse) in King Street and on [St Michael's Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael_on_the_Mount_Without), endowed [Queen Elizabeth's Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth%27s_Hospital) school and helped found [Colston's Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colston%27s_School), a boarding school which opened in 1710 leaving an endowment to be managed by the [Society of Merchant Venturers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Merchant_Venturers) for its upkeep. He gave money to schools in Temple (one of which went on to become [St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary_Redcliffe_and_Temple_School)) and other parts of Bristol, and to several churches and the cathedral. He was a strong [Tory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory) and [high-churchman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_church), and was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_(UK_Parliament_constituency)) in 1710 for just one parliament.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Colston#cite_note-ODNB-7) 

David Hughson writing in 1808 described Colston:

I was born and raised and still live in *Denmark*, which was ""occupied territory"". I've been to both the concentration camps in Theresienstadt, Czechia, and Auschwitz, Poland. I've visited the Normandy museum and the World War II museum in Caen, France. I've also been to the World War II museum in Copenhagen just for good measure. I've even been to the Schindler Factory museum in Krakow, Poland.

> The reason to preserve stuff like this is not to glorify the messed up past of these individuals/parties/whatever but so that it may serve as a constant reminder of where we came from and the mistakes we made.

 The methods with which China is suppressing their populus cannot be compared to the GDR. Sure, surveillance was widespread in the GDR, but Social Score™️? Literal concentration camps? Thousands of people just going missing every year? The GDR came nothing close to what China is capable of now.

China is basically a Stalinist machine fuelled by ultramodern technology and one of the best economies on earth. The result is a hyper effective dictatorship with means of oppressing its people that dictators of the 20th century never could have dreamt of.

It's horrifying.


EDIT: ""One of the *best economies* on earth"" - when measured in GDP or GDP (PPP), which of course doesn't say anything about the stability or resulting citizen welfare of the economy.

Edit:
To give more details, as someone that has been going to almost every protests, I can safely say that there ARE elderly's coming out, mainly called the '守護孩子' group. Previously, there has been elderly protests as well to show that there is people coming out, but it's only a minority. Most people in the front lines, also called 勇武 are mainly secondary and university students (as seen from my own experience and news sources) while most elders are either 廢老 (useless elders) that supports the CCP blindly and bashes the protestors or they support the protestors but they are 和理非 (believes in non-violence methods). They are also the ones that are help  providing financial and resource assistance to the youngsters in the front lines. Hope this clears up things a bit.

Edit: 
This is a complete video of what happened, it was NOT self defense. He actively ran to the protestors and they THEN tried to defend themselve which is when the police shot.

 Trump Jr. proposed to her with a $100,000 ring that he got for free from a jeweler in exchange for proposing to her in front of paparazzi outside of the jeweler's store in a New Jersey mall.[16] Together they have five children.[23]

jvzl6f,I felt this way the first time I tried shrooms. My friends kept flaking on me when we planned to take them. I eventually broke off from the friend group (for other reasons). It was really hard for me because they were my only friends besides my boyfriend & his brother. I decided to trip on my own and the guys took me on a hike to a waterfall. I felt like a little kid again. I remember the trees swaying and swirling like they were dancing. Beautiful patterns in the mud under my feet. Just being absolutely amazed and in love with the world. After that trip I felt so much more aligned with myself. I felt secure enough to be happy without so many friends. I hope to take another trip someday 😌,2020-11-18 14:32:42

Help me spread the information about protests location and time EVERYWHERE. If we, Russians, do it on social media, we now face up to a 15.000$ fee and 3 years in prison if the government traces us. Independent newsletters are being trashed right now by the police, we go undercover on Telegram, but it is not enough to reach out to the amount of people we need. Facebook and many websites are banned. BBC is banned. Opposition can barely breath. Some decided to go short radio waves. Help us spread the word!

khubfr,"Good points you’ve made.

And, last I checked, American Women still don’t have Equal Rights...  I wonder how long we’ve been fighting for that?

Edit:  Answer to question - Approximately 97 Years. 

Edit:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment

“The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is[note 1] a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution designed to guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex. It seeks to end the legal distinctions between men and women in matters of divorce, property, employment, and other matters.[1] The first version of an ERA was written by Alice Paul and Crystal Eastman and introduced in Congress in December 1923.[2][3][4]”

Edit:  https://eraeducationproject.com/dont-men-and-women-already-have-equal-rights-in-america/

“Don’t Men and Women Already Have Equal Rights in America?

Women Are the Majority of the Population Yet Our Government Still Denies Them Full Civil and Human Rights.

RESEARCH SHOWS THAT 75% – 90% OF AMERICANS MISTAKENLY BELIEVE THE ERA PASSED AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN ARE EQUAL UNDER THE LAW.”

“Women won the right to vote in 1920. The next step was supposed to be full equality for women under the Constitution. Almost a century later, that still has not happened. The United States Constitution still does not provide women with the same rights as men. Ratifying the ERA would secure a woman’s rights and provide her with legal equality in the United States of America.

Not only has the United States not ratified the Equal Rights Amendment it is the only developed nation that has not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Countries who ratify the CEDAW are required to enshrine gender equality into their domestic legislation, repeal all discriminatory provisions in their laws, and enact new provisions to guard against discrimination against women. The only countries in the United Nations who haven’t ratified CEDAW are: Iran, Palau, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Tonga, and the United States.

Comprising a majority of the population both in the United States and worldwide, women presently bear the brunt of economic injustice, violence, poverty and hunger. Studies show that improving the condition of women raises the standard of living for the community as a whole.

If the ERA were ratified, there would no longer be a reason for the United States not to ratify CEDAW. The impact on the women worldwide, if the U.S. ratified CEDAW, would be profound and life changing for tens of millions of women and girls. The enforcement of CEDAW worldwide depends on the United States commitment to women – for this commitment to be real, we need full legal equality for women here at home first.

ERA is the First Step in Achieving Global Justice for Women.”


Edit:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/98247518

“What do men get that women don't? Here are a few things...”

“The National Women’s Conference called for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would explicitly ban discrimination based on sex. The women asked for affordable childcare, equal pay for equal work and that the federal government fund abortions for women who could not afford the procedure. They stressed the importance of national healthcare. They called for an end to discriminatory rape laws. They demanded the nation stop deporting immigrant mothers of American-born children...”

“They emphasized again the need for ""affordable childcare,"" ""equal pay"" and ""access to safe, legal, affordable abortion and birth control."" They said women have a right to live ""free of all forms of violence against our bodies"" and that ""it is our moral duty to keep families together.""


https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/discrimination/womens-rights/

“Women’s rights are human rights!

We are all entitled to human rights. These include the right to live free from violence and discrimination; to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; to be educated; to own property; to vote; and to earn an equal wage.

But across the globe many women and girls still face discrimination on the basis of sex and gender. Gender inequality underpins many problems which disproportionately affect women and girls, such as domestic and sexual violence, lower pay, lack of access to education, and inadequate healthcare.”

“Workplace Discrimination 

Often, women are the subject of gender based discrimination in the workplace. One way of illustrating this is to look at the gender pay gap. Equal pay for the same work is a human right, but time and again women are denied access to a fair and equal wage. Recent figures show that women currently earn roughly 77% of what men earn for the same work. This leads to a lifetime of financial disparity for women, prevents them from fully exercising independence, and means an increased risk of poverty in later life.”

Edit:  Who are the nitwits downvoting the FACTS that women don’t have Equal Rights in America?  

Just proves the point. I Rest My Case.  LOL 

I shouldn’t laugh actually, it’s sad.

This incident is hardly a case of assault or anything of the kind, and much of the condemnation of the riot police seems excessive here.... the video shows an officer hit the cameraman with his shield (honestly, I feel like it’s offensive to call that hit “assault”) and then proceed to move his camera away so that he can get on with moving, as the police clearly look to have been instructed to get the rioters away. Still images and claims of a punch being thrown are so utterly laughable, but the response of the POTUS’s claiming self-defence is clearly false and reiterates their consistent deniability in the face of video evidence of incorrect behaviour - there’s a video! 
Just say the officer shouldn’t have done it, his response was not perfect but high intensity situations can sometimes cause these types of responses. This is something we need to work on.

brt43t,"I know a lot of people on here haven't ever been to China for any amount of time, but one thing I feel is very different is the ""perceived value of life"". I was dating a girl from Shanghai for a bit and traveling there for work/to see her. 

""Perceived value of life"" is something that fluctuates between places and typically drops in high population areas. I think someone actually put a metric to it, but I can give a short example. 

I was riding the New York subway one morning and the train was delayed. Apparently someone had jumped in front of the train before us and committed suicide. In a small town this would be news worthy and people would typically feel shocked/sympathy for this person. However in new York everyone on the train is more irritated they will be 15 minutes later to where they were going and are pretty indifferent to the fact that somebody had just passed away by their own hand. I mean, it happens about once a week the same way in New York. 

This indifference feels times 1000x in China. For how amazing and huge Shanghai is there's a ton of stuff that as a Westerner makes you feel like perceived value of human life is really low. Appalling safety regulations: the Pearl tv tower having compromised glass panels that people stand on just roped off with plastic tape, and later I was watching a video where I was standing on a different glass panel and you could see where someone wearing high heels had punched a hole in the glass. Mind you this is like 450 meters off the ground. And you get the feeling that if someone fell through, they would clean up the ground below, rope off the panel, and start letting people back in. 

The arrangement of marriages is a big reason why my friends and coworkers came west from China, which is a whole other story in itself. 

Live streaming your entire vacations in hopes of increasing your perceived social value and climb the class ladder... 

I can list a bunch of other examples but this post is already getting too damn long 😂.

There are a ton of good people in China and I honestly feel pretty bad for them. I have made a bunch of friends over there and they are incredibly welcoming.

But I think that the society as a whole is primed in a way that makes this whole social credit system in China absolutely terrifying and makes me worry for the people who live there. It honestly feels like there was a ton of social engineering going on in preparation for the technology to catch up. And my anecdotal experiences makes me feel that the current social climate will ignite this system like a match to gasoline. Combine hyper competitiveness, desire to climb class ladders, and low perceived value of human life from subconscious conditioning... People will do the government's job of complete control for them.",2019-05-23 07:44:50

Most of us just don't want to talk politics at work, especially when it's all we get bombarded with on a regular basis outside of work.

9dfjpf,"Great. Now the degenerates are going to come out to play, they'll be out on street corners waving signs and banners and shit a whooping up a whole hullabaloo.

Just because we let them have this. This one extra thing. They'll be out in droves, gathered together in their sick little clumps, because you know they're a smaller percentage than they'd want you to believe.

But those religious idiots will use this one thing to cry victim despite it not affecting them! Despite the love of two people not harming anyone in anyway, and actually being a boon on society, there will still be extremists and holdouts for years who feel personally attacked by people choosing other people to hold hands with than what is 'approved' by their twisted sense of morals.

This is great news and a big step towards equality. The war isn't won but this was a huge victory towards the ultimate battle of just treating other people like people.

Congrats to my brother's and sisters! You've deserved this victory for awhile and I hope it starts a cultural shift in smaller communities as well.

t4l397,"Dude, from the sounds of it though, Russia's boots on the ground are a hot mess. They are winning because of sheer numbers (which we all knew would be the case without western intervention). 

With Russia not reporting or recording deaths, I would bet it won't be too hard to go undercover and switch sides, tbh. The organization of the troops is lacking and many have been told they were going on a ""peacekeeping"" mission and were surprised they were getting shot at, didn't know why...can you imagine? 😭😭😭😭

I hate Putin so much. I am willing to take one for the team to get rid of him. I've always ragged on the U.S. anyway so they wouldn't think I was put up to it. I would write a manifesto and everything.

At this point, I'm unsure how much support he actually has in his inner circle. They might be just operating on fear, and with their salaries dropping dramatically, if there are any not living the life of the oligarchs, they'll flip. I really think the only way Putin will be stopped is being done in by his inner circle.

Good call on the soldiers, even if it is a lie to get the Russians to start distrustring each other and also consider the fact there *are* others who are flipping, that may get more of them to flip to and turn themselves in.

Matter of fact, now that I think about it, fuck the sanctions and the hope the psychopath stops being a psychopath. I think our best bet is to campaign to the Russian soldiers. Ask the ones who have turned themselves in what might work. Start handing out pamphlets with support messages from around the world..telling them they can stop and don't have to die. Fly a sign telling them to lay their arms down and the **world** will think of you as heroes. Think about your kids, etc. Play videos of the death and murders on every corner of the streets. With messages that they don't have to do this. Promise them calls home and use the surrendered soldiers to recruit the others. Maybe they are doing all these things already.

Totally blitz trying to get the soldiers to defect. Unfortunately, without western military intervention, millions of Ukrainians are about to starve, die from bombs or not having access to necessary medication. They are about to run out of fuel. This war needs to end yesterday and sanctions are not going to do it before the millions start dying.

I think the world should campaign the Russian soldiers. Show them compassion and that it is not their fault and not their fight. We will take care of them. The Ukrainian government is already offering $48k in Rubles and amnesty to surrender, that is amazing. But let us not forget the power of the human spirit and people's desire to be and feel ""welcomed"" after being bad.",2022-03-02 02:02:04

There might have been an assassination plot (really, I'd be surprised if there wasn't), and such a plot might have failed due to Ukraine being warned by anti-war insiders from Russia. All of this might be true, but all of this is also a good story for Ukraine.

My point is, we can't really believe anything coming from either side while this is happening. Nevertheless, I'm just really thankful that Zelenskyy is still going strong 🙏✊🇺🇦",2022-03-02 03:53:49

TCE claims that the meeting discussed the reprofiling of one of the hospital buildings to receive Covid-19 patients.  According to the channel, the head doctor was against reprofiling: she referred to the lack of protective equipment and the unpreparedness of the staff of the medical institution.  “It is possible that it was these circumstances that prompted the woman to commit a desperate act,” the TCE claims, citing a source.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

ikt6ws,"“When American friends ask for an explanation, I encourage them to reflect on the last time they bought groceries at their neighborhood Safeway. In the U.S. there is almost always a racial, economic, cultural, and educational chasm between the consumer and the check-out staff that is difficult if not impossible to bridge. In Canada, the experience is quite different. One interacts if not as peers, certainly as members of a wider community. The reason for this is very simple. The checkout person may not share your level of affluence, but they know that you know that they are getting a living wage because of the unions. And they know that you know that their kids and yours most probably go to the same neighborhood public school. Third, and most essential, they know that you know that if their children get sick, they will get exactly the same level of medical care not only of your children but of those of the prime minister. These three strands woven together become the fabric of Canadian social democracy.”

•It rewards actual money for the content by views. 
•It is relatively new but it has already got 1 million+ users inside 4 days. 
•Chingaari means spark and it is made to counter tik tok in the aftermath of anti-china sentiment in india.

P. S :I am not a user of any of the apps but still I have downloaded just to support anything which is anti-china.

While every normal high rolling political party member is up to the usual shit, (plastic bag over their head, getting sucked off by anyone who will take their money)… Putin’s tucked up in bed tossing one off to the thought of being the Russian leader who destroyed the free world…

The man’s like a kid with his mothers underwear catalogs….

Serious point tho… Putin, his advisers and analysts went into the Ukrainian with a very good understanding of the consequences. Both to him and more importantly the hardworking honest people of Russia!!

Russian family’s all over the country are going to suffer like never before. What Putin has done in Europe would seal the Russian peoples fate…

Both Putin and his henchmen would have calculated for this… 

To put Russia on a one way street to bankruptcy is not the move of a man who’s been planning, preparing and dirtying his pillow cases over for years while thinking about it… 

Come on… Russia’s total isolation from the world and all that is good in it. In exchange for the glory of being hated even more by the good people of Russia?

For the respect of his soon to be not so very wealthy closest friends.?

Friends who would who would go all Julius Caesar on his arse and stick him with a very pointed thing ? 

I really don’t think that’s the legacy the Great leader,.., Vlad P wants to leave behind, do you?…. Can’t see it myself ?.., which leaves me with one alternative…

He wants to be the man to destroy the free world. Restoring all glory to Russia, To be the Greatest Russians leader their ever was by bringing down the biblical fires of hell on us all..,

All while he’s pulling his tired shrivelled old cock into his sock.., 

Putin is one devious Wanker!

You would think so, and I would agree and argue that many small businesses are subject to this, receiving grants for beneficial projects and paying fines for damaging the community. 


But for larger companies? I don’t think it holds nearly as true in practice. I hate to mention Amazon again, but it was just a year ago that they had multiple cities (including my own) who were prepared to throw insane tax incentives to Amazon for a new HQ. Now does Amazon provide jobs? Sure they do. Are those jobs worth billions in tax breaks and other benefits over 10+ years?  Almost certainly not, but jobs now = re-election.

He promised Hitler the air force could destroy the British at Dunkirk and there was no need for a land attack, so they held off on a land attack and the British escaped. Then he told Hitler his air force could easily destroy the RAF, then destroy the British navy in the channel and allow for a crossing into Britain. Obviously didn't happen. He also told Hitler they could air supply the encircled army at Stalingrad to keep them supplied, but only a tiny fraction of the supplies needed and promised got though via air supply.

hlrjkp,"(1/2) Gotta hijack top comment to talk about wealth inequality  

   

 Inequality in general is so much worse than most people realize and there's plenty of information that proves it. So, where to start?

[The ultra-rich are hoarding as much as $32 trillion ($32,000,000,000,000) in offshore accounts to avoid taxes.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth-idUSBRE86L03U20120722) As a way to understand just how much 32 trillion is, let's use time as an example. One million seconds is 12 days, and one billion seconds is 31.7 years. That's already a massive difference between a million and a billion, but how much is 32 trillion seconds? It's over a million years.

Most people know that wealth inequality is a huge issue, but they don't understand just how bad it is. Here's an example: **If  you had a job that paid you $2,000 an hour, and you worked full time (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all  of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much money as Jeff Bezos.**

I've been researching this issue for years because I was shocked at just how bad it really is, and I've put together some information to help illustrate it.

hlrjkp,"^^ Yup, that makes sense!  When I was doing my research on what car to get, I got a little geeky and went down a few informational rabbit holes. For those who will see this comment later & do not know:

-	Acura is the luxury brand of Honda
-	Infinity is the luxury brand of Nissan
-	Lexus is the luxury brand of Toyota (this one is pretty well-known, I think)
-	Amati was Mazda’s effort for a luxury brand but it didn’t pan out due to Japan’s economic straits in the early 1990s (the Lost Decade)
-	Subaru is too small for the auto manufacturer to create its own luxury brand, though Toyota has an ownership stake in the brand (I think between 15%-20%). Toyota and Subaru will be working closely together for sports cars collabs in the next few years, from what I remember.

Seeing your comment reminded me of my learned tidbits - hopefully people will see our comments and find the information useful.  I ended up choosing the 2019 Subaru Crosstrek (my username👌).  I admit my SO influenced that switch - he has a Subaru and I like how safe I feel in it, he didn’t need to sell it to me at all. Some of my loved ones swear by Toyota, Honda, Mazda and Nissan. 

I had a Chevrolet Malibu that surprisingly lasted 15 years. For that feat of longevity from an American brand (and probably most long lasting cars), the comments here are absolutely right: routine maintenance.

7pxoi3,So...  Haiti an el Salvador are not shitholes???   News to me 🐸☕,2018-01-12 21:04:29
7pxoi3,"why this is racist, from another post from /u/BadDecisionDino

The most offensive part about Trump's comments today wasn't the word ""shithole"".  It was the word ""Why"".

“*Why* are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?”

Do people even really understand what our president is saying?

Look, I'm not angry because he calls places ""shitholes"". I'm a first generation immigrant.  I come from a shithole. I lived 10 years in a shithole.  I'll freely call it a shithole. I won't get offended if you call it a shithole!  It's a shithole!  Happy?

But how DARE he use my origin as an excuse to demand an additional reason to explain my presence here? Why is it up to me (but not say, a white Norwegian) to provide some extra level of justification for why I deserve the chance to be an American?

If these places really are shitholes, shouldn't there be an even greater [obligation](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7pv08v/a_new_low_the_world_is_furious_at_trump_for_his/dslstbi/) to help people who come from there, specifically because they're in the most danger?  

Apparently not. Because Trump sincerely believes that *some* people do, and *some* people do not deserve the chance to be Americans, and your birthplace (and by extension, your race) is a key deciding factor in whether you deserve the chance to be an American.  And it just so happens that the ""right"" places happen to be white.

Notice that he did not ask ""Why are we letting in poor people?"" or ""Why are we letting in people without degrees?"" or ""Why are we letting in people with criminal histories"" or ""Why are we letting in people who refuse to learn English?"".  

No, let's cut the crap, already, because deep down, we know damn well that he's not talking about merit, or even about your place of origin.  After everything you've seen, who do you think Trump is more likely to feel is more deserving citizenship?  One of those scary Muslims that are ""taking over"" Norway, or a white South African?  Cuz I got a feeling that when he gets a look at those people, the calculus for determining whether their home countries count as ""shitholes"" suddenly changes. 

Trump is practically saying *""America is for white people. The rest are interlopers until proven otherwise. Until someone explains to me WHY they're even allowed here.""*  Let's not forget either, that in this particular situation, he's not even talking about illegal immigrants.  He doesn't get to even use that old fig-leaf.  

He's talking about a reconfiguration of who we even allow the *chance* to become legal, through all the proper channels, not based on merit, not based on national security, not based on employability, but specifically targeted against the people he happens to hate.

And yet, the media is taking the bait. Already they rush to obfuscate the issue, to absolve him of the real evil of his comment by focusing on the ""inappropriate word"" he used.

Already, we're having these dumb conversations like *""Well, he denied that he said that exact word, but he said she said that he did!""* or *""Well, to be fair, Haiti isn't exactly a nice place to live, he's just saying what everyone thinks privately, and he just chose a colorful word to describe it...""*, and instead of focusing on the racism, we just go *""Oh, but look at the pretty beaches of Haiti! It's not a shithole!  Look at the natural beauty and rich culture of-""* SHUT THE FUCK UP!
 
What bearing does that debate have on anything?!? As if Trump's greatest sin is his vocabulary and not watching the Travel Channel?

What our president said today isn't just boorish, it isn't just cruel. It betrays a deep and insidious level of racism that can only be described as white supremacy.  Again.  This is a pattern, don't forget.  But in this instance, he is literally throwing a tantrum because the ""wrong people"" are enjoying the benefit of immigration.

And it is so depressing and so terrifying, that even Trump's opponents - the people who represent the best hope we got to survive this regime - are just gonna waltz past that and *chide him for his language.*  

If I'm the one from the shithole, how come Americans are so stupid that they keep falling for this crap over and over?

**EDIT:  Ooooooh, I'm gonna have fun now.**

Just so ya'll know, there's dozens of replies to this post saying shit like:

> ""He is right, we don’t want your kind in the West we wish you would just fuck off and go away.""

> ""Because the US is a white country. We want more white people and thr country to remain white majority.""

> ""The chances that people from a shithole country integrate well into American society are too low for us to want to take a chance on them. Doesn't make us bad people.""

> ""The reason these shithole countries are just that is the people that made them such. They'll just bring the shithole to the US just like Europe is experiencing already. You can take the 🐒 from the jungle but not the jungle from the 🐒.""

**But my absolute favorite is this one.**

> Its because most people who are from shitholes dont turn out fine and dandy. Eg, slumdog getting accepted into **Ivy college**. Its a news worthy title because its rare. While I hate Trump, you have to understand that he's merely a symptom of the greater American ignorance. He is the biggest reflection of how most Americans think. Silencing him is not the correct method. Social change is not easy or even deemed possible for many.

fggiom,"It's a short term high-cost policy (which has *always* been cheaper in the long run) that increases immediate spending but shows, with proven results, to be the most effective way to handle a health care crisis. 
Politicians up for election this year will happily ignore risk factors, avoid ""increasing numbers that aren't our fault"" and deny testing kits for anyone feeling symptoms of Covid-19. 
Unfortunately for the politician I am referring to, they are also in the high risk category of contracting the virus and so are many if their supporters.
Remember, though: these tests are beautiful and if this leader did not pursue politics, they were going to be a ""successful virus scientist"" like their prestigious ""supergenius"" uncle that taught Engineering at MIT.

To people all around the world,

We, Hongkongers just experienced a terrorist attack planned and executed by our Hong Kong Police Force. At about 10pm today, our police force rushed into our railway system in Prince Edward station, got in to the carriage and indifferently beat up all the people in it regardless they are protesters or simply passengers. They ignored the weapon guidelines and fired tear gas indoor in the carriage which is in fact lethal. Also, they beat up innocent people causing them seriously wounded. Some passengers kneeled before them asking them to stop but the response they got were beaten ever harder. Meanwhile, the police haven’t arrested the passengers after they got beaten up, showing that the only purpose of their brutality was to sort their anger to violence but not dispersing the crowd.

We, Hongkongers are experiencing a humanitarian crisis and we hope that people all over the world can help us in anyways you can think of. Thank you and we will stay strong.

Once you legislate that others have a say in what happens to your body and organs, unless you’re a MISOGYNIST you’ll have to concede when eventually this will apply across genders to things like organ donation.  

In this world, for example, if someone would die without your kidney (since you’re a match), then under this regime you’d have no say and be forced under penalty of law to undergo a risky surgery to give from your body through no choice of your own—even if you agreed beforehand you should have the right to revoke, but under your dream unethical dystopia you would have no such right.  If you died in surgery, oh well, what are you, a monster who doesn’t support someone’s right to life?  How dare you assert that your body should be your domain and we don’t have the right to force you to keep someone alive!  You clearly don’t value life! 😏",2020-05-04 01:41:25

Also, if the fetus was a separate life then they’d BE separate bodies, that’s literally the definition, so no shit it has no protections legally—it’s a parasite in behavior at that point, not like the autonomous human woman carrying it that doesn’t rely on anyone’s organs (you know, as an actual separate life and all).  

You have no logic to cover over the obvious misogyny that somehow the woman’s life takes a back seat although she’s the only actualized human being in the equation.  That’s why your religion is hemorrhaging followers—everyone is done with the Christian hateful bullshit.  People have used Christianity and the Catholic Church to enact disgusting atrocities, so you people and your hypocritical “rules” are laughable.  And nobody cares, abortions always existed and once again, it’s even in your bible you dumbass, so no one will care and women will still get abortions just like your bible told them how to many years ago 😉.",2020-05-06 14:19:50
gcqjxh,">But when you do it right, the abortion is not extracting a baby. It's extracting a clump of cells.

At 24 weeks it is not a clump of cells. Also the clump of cells is still a human life. It is alive. It is of the human species. Therefore it is human life. It is wrong to kill an innocent human life.

> It's only murder when there's a beating heart involves

Lmao what the fuck. Who told you that. Guess I can go break into hospitals and shoot people in the middle of heart transplant surgery and it won’t be murder 🤷‍♂️",2020-05-03 20:43:46
gcqjxh,">clearly shows a greater relative divide between Democrat and Republican viewpoints, and shows a strong shift towards Liberalism with Democrats, but then it attempts to label them as being ""extremists"".

Well if you have 2 sides and one doesn't move from the original point and the other moves a lot, that is called moving to an extreme. The term ""extreme"" doesn't necessarily mean anything negative. But that is what is happening. So when you say

>There's a clear trend of extreme views around social policy creeping into conservative politics

That tells me that you believe that the right is moving further right, which is inverse of what is actually happening. So your overall claim is false.

>None of that is ""extremism"" by any reasonable definition.

You're missing the point of the article 🤣  if an entire party is moving further away from the center that is by definition moving to the extremes. Republican viewpoints haven't changed much at all over the last 30 years. Democrats are quite the opposite. Just for example ill throw out abortion. Back in the 90s it was the stance of the DNC that abortion be safe, legal, and rare and agreed on term limits. Now people can get abortions post birth in some states...how is that not extreme?

I suggest you read the actual PEW article. It's pretty clear that democrats have shifted in recent years to hold more liberal views ie become more extreme.

Sorry you don't understand how the context of extreme works in politics.

>It's far more likely that this shift towards Liberalism is a direct result of failures in social policy combined with growing income inequality and sharply rising healthcare costs within the United States, rather than some extreme left wing agenda.

Literally all caused by liberal policies to begin with lmao",2020-05-04 20:03:26

nsfjxa,"> These things don't accidently happen, you don't accidently censor very specific images, you don't accidently type up, approve at multiple levels and publish a blog post.

I don't really have an opinion either way on this particular thing, but it's absolutely possible that it was posted in error. It doesn't get typed up by accident, no, but consider that maybe at one point that deal was in the pipeline. Pending final approval, marketing materials were produced and put into the pipeline. But the deal was nixed, and so the materials produced were abandoned. Except, on that one platform, somebody forgot to delete the post. Most stuff like that is queued up in advance and automatically posted on a schedule these days, so there likely wasn't anybody who intentionally clicked the post button. Just a case of a forgetful, or absent, employee not removing the post from the queue when circumstances changed. Similar things have happened where I work. It's not a conspiracy, just human error in an organization with many moving parts and tight deadlines. 🤷‍♀️",2021-06-05 00:28:05

People should know. 

The so called Google doc had - 

1. a plan of action to cause physical disturbance across Indian embassies in the world
2. A plan to change Indias ""Chai and yoga"" image!! - what's that got to do with the farmers protest?
3. Had links to promote accounts run by khalistani separatists (go figure yourself)


And icing on the cake.. For all this climate activist nonsense, one of the key demands of the protesting ""farmers"" is that they should not be penalised for stubble burning.. The same stubble burning that converts Delhi into a gas chamber for months every year..  And so called climate activists are supporting this. This demand by the way has already been agreed by the govt 🤦🏽‍♂️ - now that's something I want to protest over.

The reality is, these protests are not about about farmers.. These are about securing the  middlemen who currently hold power over farmers.. Because the current system creates a monopolistic system where farmers can sell only and only at their designated markets and at the price which has been set by these middlemen. The new laws change this. The new laws give farmers and option to sell anywhere in the country and at whichever price they want with the option of selling at the MSP or the minimum support price at the designated market if rates at other markets are not good. How is that not OK? 

India wastes tonnes and tonnes of raw food every year because govt does not have the storage capacity. These laws allow private companies to setup storage facilities  - how is that a bad thing!? 

Can someone explain. Which other country has so many restrictions on doing business for a sector as India. How is changing this situation bad?",2021-02-15 12:32:16
lccy63,"I have a big reminders for all fellow foreigners who wants to live more scam free and a better,safe life .it might be off the topic but as an good guy and an indian wistelblower I am saying this .


You must avoid ,ignore  those typical indians boys or mens who are unhealthy and narrow from mind .they are full of toxicity and have lots of mental issues in general as the education or any infrastructure is not yet up the mark ..just don't approach too many indian people cuz many have rapist(not most but many ) or just sexist mentality and the population of indian is a good proof for that and they say or claim women or cow to be goddesses but actually most of them treat their women so bad and shitty. they beat the women. many do child abuse or rape ..the child rapes and murder or rapes  cases are one of the most in india mainly in andar pradesh ,uttar pradesh ,Bihar ,Hariyana, and all the poor and corrupt  states .the police seem to work not properly cuz they have nexus with the criminal (many dont ) and the ministers are corrupted (saying with practical experiences 🙁🙁).as a good guy I must tell yeh truth and atleat I might be successful  in preventing many further cases so plz it's my humble request to all my foreigners friend ..don't go in relationship with an  typical Indian or unhealthy or poor indians until u find someone rich or healthy minded .don't also visit the Low standard  areas or slums area cuz it's never safe ..don't take risk and I know what I mean by that . ..those poor minded  toxic narsassictic  indians are not worth the time or love of those  outside the county.


And I would also say here are many people who are can be called one of the best humans ever seen as theses things are similar in all country but I am not talking about those drama that many indians would do or do to cover Their  a$s..I am just speaking the truth .its a horrible place for women or childrens and if u have your people with you and stuffs to protect you then it would be a safer 

So plz don't also believe in any people judge them by thair work..many might confuse a good guys with a rapist so I am saying this u can really identify them easily by looking at their behavior or talks or repetitive  toxicity or unusual or alien  impressions or just thair works as they see someforigners ..many are there who would scam you so be sure u don't give away the price they ask u at first place...or just don't go where they take you (,this way you just letting them trap u )

Go check out youtube videos of"" karl rocks"" ,an foreigner in indian who exposes the indian scams and bad works  .its would give u more information to look out for and be safe when u are in india.

And alwasy remember  stay  healthy  stay happy and stay safe and alwasy share positivity and strength 😊😊😊have a great day .i hope there be more real good guys who wants good for the world .


I know some would hate me but truth and  justice Means more than anything or those hate $hit words that many would give me after I revealed this in a nutshell.",2021-03-15 13:24:03
lccy63,"The RSS is a modern day Nazi Party. Their Racism and fascism  is openly celebrated by their followers. This groups ideology is what lead to an extremist assassinating one of the most prominent Indian figures of all time Mahatma Gandhi. Just search RSS against Muslims on YouTube. For a country who has excelled in every field and is about to put a man on the moon, very little action is taken against Classist, Racist and Fascist ideologies within India. Modi acted on instructions directly from his RSS vote bank. It’s 2019, Indians should actively remove hate seekers within their country, like Pakistan is now doing after Imran Khan got elected. Like no terrorist faction is allowed to operate within Pakistan & politicians whom are corrupt and religious extremists are being forcefully ousted, India should do the same. The region would mutually prosper  if they were to eliminate these few factions and allow for open intellectual dialogue and trade. The new generation of Pakistanis only want a prosperous future together in harmony. 

Modi was once denied a Visa to the US for crimes he was involved in during his time in office in Gujrat. Here’s a link: 👇🏽

We were ”poor” in Finlands standard, yet again we had a roof on our heads and food to eat. But the reason that im still gratefull and will forever be is the fact that people like us were qiven equal opportunities for education. No matter your background or who you are you will truly be nurtured into whatever you dream to become.

Here I am , a foreigner from absolute nothing studying in the best Uni Finlnd has to offer alongside the children of the most wealthy, with all the possibilities I could ever dream of.

I truly believe that equal opportunity is the single most valuable aspect that a country can have. I am so incredibly thankfull for this country and its people, for believing in us and giving us the opportunity to became what we truly want to become and achieve our full potential.

Now I have this inner calling to do wahtever I can to give back and see future generations do the same.

That's why a place like Finland seems almost heaven to them. The average redditor lacks any sort of ambition. Sure Finland isn't known for their universities, technology, cutting edge sciences/medicine development, military strength, philosophy, culture, etc. But by God, they ensure that everyone will be able to make around 40k and have a 2 bedroom home.

t2n3sl,"Yeah, the US took Iraq and one of the largest militaries on the planet and just sorta... Annihilated it. I mean for the Iraqi military to fall apart the way it did on home soil is tremendously impressive.

The US tends to fight in the worst possible scenarios - supply lines that cross oceans and wrap around the whole planet, offensive wars, tactics with your arms tied behind your back so you kill as few civilians as possible - and it looks easy anyway. The US going all-out conventional war if someone tried to invade would probably be fucking terrifying...

The problem with the US military is that the part after the fight is really hard and we have no clue what we're doing. We fight wars with poorly defined objectives, so we win militarily and then dawdle about forever until we eventually give up and go home.

The problem with the Russian military is that it wants to be the US military, but it doesn't have the experience or the resources. Force projection is hard, and it's doubly so if your logistics are garbage (sometimes literally...)

From a purely analytical perspective, removing the fact of how awful war is, this is a really amazing conflict to watch, because it shows the power of intelligence and logistics and other forms of ""soft power"" - counting number of tanks and missiles and aircraft, Russia should just crush Ukrainian forces and be done with it, but they're failing at logistics, and Ukrainian leaders are being fed high quality western intelligence while Russian intelligence consists of leaking troop movements on Tinder.

It's no surprise that Russia has to let its own blood soak the soil it's gaining in this war - The only advantage they actually have is brute force, and hoping to jam up the Ukrainian meat grinder with your own men is really not a good way to fight a war...

We're not oppressed like the Chinese and can say how shit our government is. The Chinese can't. Chinese government is also actively committing genocide.

That being said I do try and avoid Chinese products as much as I can. Sometimes its impossible which is really depressing. But I spend a long time (potentially weeks) finding a product not made in China. Sometimes I just won't buy what I want at all. I can live without it. Go to /r/avoidchineseproducts for help finding things not made in China.

After decades of opening up Western market to China while turning a blind eye to rampant Chinese IP thefts, forced tech transfers, & protectionism, we are looking at widespread control of Western firms by China. Firms that are not under outright Chinese control still kowtow to China out of fear of China's retaliation.

This is a very incomplete list of what we're seeing publicly. Imagine how bad it is behind closed doors.

**Update:**

* Red bull is fake and a foot licker. Video was fan edit :(

* Disney supported cast of Mulan in their anti HK rhetoric.

Please add your own examples ...if you've fact checked it and fact check these too.  Facts still matter!  

And If you want to know why all this matters you can Google China's involvement in ethnic cleansing, execution vans, concentration camps, child prostitution, organ harvesting, western IP theft, citizen brain washing and much more. 

And remember this is an issue with the Chinese government and not the wonderful people and history of China and it's contribution to the world.  This isnt xenophobia.  This is about it's autocrat dictator god emperor for life Ji Xingping and his evil corrupt rule.

hgjogs,These obviously are subjective but many jobs pay much better in the US than they do in Canada and in general the US is the hub for all industries and elite colleges so it is a more attractive destination for many. The way I see it is that Canada is better for about 70% of the country and the US is better for the top 30% so US is a more attractive destination for skilled professionals. The weather in the US is better 😀. I personally found that some parts of Canada such as Quebec are much more resistant to immigrants and other cultures than the US in general.

mgw4xs,"Ok let’s keep it really simple for everyone reading this. We will use Toronto, Canada, as the basis for home price comparison: 

The average price of a house in 1996 was 198,150$. 

The minimum wage in Toronto in 1996 was 9.03$ per hour. Adjusting for inflation, that would be 14,19$ in 2021.

Adjusting for inflation, that 198,150$ house should be worth 312,170$ today in 2021. 

The minimum wage in Toronto today is 14,35$ per hour. 

The Average cost of a house in Toronto is 1,000,000$+ today. 

So, basic math, and adjusting for inflation, house prices have more than tripled, well over 300% increase, from 1996 to today. 

Minimum wage has increased, based on inflation, by 52% since 1996 to today. 

To quickly summarize, from 1996 to today, minimum wage has increased by 52% and house prices have increased over 300%. 

In order for Canada’s minimum wage to match its housing market increase, the minimum wage of Canada would need to be at least 43$ per hour. The minimum wage in Toronto is 14,35$. 

Even with 2 salaries, both earning minimum wage, a couple would not be able to afford buying a house. They will be forced to rent for life. 

And with the skyrocketing rent, they’ll need extra income to be able to afford even that. Canadians have been priced out of home ownership. That ship has sailed for the vaste majority. 

And for the next generation? Enjoy paying 2000$ a month for a one bedroom apartment.

mgw4xs,"Yes because I don’t think that a sufficient living standard is “unreachable” so I called him a classic Reddit leftie. In the UK we do a lot of sarcasm and think sometimes it’s hard to pick up from text unless you’re British. Although, you have to admit that the majority of Reddit are left wing Americans. Or am I wrong? However, to me it seems that my entire front page of Reddit is just AOC tweets/quotes and other left wing tweets/quotes and any comment that’s left wing gets heavily upvoted and anything that right wing gets heavily downvoted? Although, to be honest I don’t fucking blame you, I would probably be screaming AOC quotes at the top of my voice if I lived in the richest country in the world, with the largest economy and massive military spending, where you literally have to just die if you can’t afford insulin and you’re born with diabetes, especially since insulin is made expensive as fuck. Although, I may be wrong but I believe I saw a news article saying that insulin had gotten more expensive under Biden? It could be a bs article though but if that’s true, you wouldn’t see it on the front page because America has gotten so divided that it seems you can only be left or right. You can’t be in the middle. If you’re left you can’t criticise the democrats and if you’re right you cant criticise the republicans. That’s how it seems to me anyway. So, since most people on Reddit are democrats you wouldn’t see any criticism of Biden or AOC because it would get downvoted. So then Reddit just turns into a bit of an echo chamber where the  majority opinions gets heavily upvoted but minority views do not. Idk 🤷‍♂️",2021-04-01 10:32:14

123iv0t,"A bit of background- the lands vikings occupied had poor earth for plant growth. A lot of pillaging happened as a means to survive. They also lived on peninsulas/islands which offered no room for expansion. 

Essentially raiding vastly improved quality of life. Over hundreds of years it fed on itself and raiding became deeply embedded in the culture… next thing you know their gods fuckin LOVE war. 

Another factor- the viking penalty for various crimes was exile. If, say, Illinois started taking their violent offenders and pushing them over the state line into Wisconsin and Missouri you bet your ass crime rates would sky-rocket. What’s an exiled raider warrior to do but knock over the first 711 him and his exiled homies see in Kenosha?

Couple that with the viking access to advanced technology (crucible steel) via trade routes from Asia- it’s no wonder the vikings kicked ass for so long. 

[For anyone who hasn’t seen the Nova doc on the Ulfbehrt sword, do yourself a favor.](https://youtu.be/namXt4Etn_o)

Favorite viking fact that is explained better in the above video: Most swords back then were made of brittle iron. The vikings had a very primitive form of steel called crucible steel which made it’s way into Scandinavia via Asian trade routes. Crucible steel will bend and flex, allowing it to not snap where iron would. It typically has much fewer imperfections as well which gave the vikings a massive technological advantage over the Europeans. 

What is CRAZY about crucible steel is it is forged by adding carbon at a certain point during the iron smelting process. What is a good source of carbon? Ashes. So, say you have the ashes of your father or grandfather and you’re making a sword. Pour a little bit o’ pappy in your sword and- like magic- you now have some advanced tech 😏

It’s literally the root of weapon enchantments and it’s TOO FUCKING COOL 😭😭😭",2023-03-27 15:28:53
123iv0t,"The Vikings in today's pop culture from movies and video games match the real Vikings only to a small extent anyway. They made up only a small part of the Scandinavian population and the term is more of a job description like pirate. Pirates also came from Spain or England, but no one today would say to a Spaniard that he must be a descendant of pirates.

But that alone just paints a hilarious scene of a couple of Finns on the shore looking at a boat of Swedes, asking each other ""who do you think those guys are?"", and then the swedes all shout ""row! row! row!""...

Consortium News Editor-in-Chief Joe Lauria presented the 2020 Gary Webb Freedom of the Press Award to WikiLeaks Editor-in-Chief Kristinn Hrafnsson on behalf of Julian Assange after a rally for Assange in Parliament Square in London.

The award reads: “For bravery in the face of a grave threat to Freedom of the Press and for journalistic accomplishments in revealing crimes of the state.”

Julian Assange Wins 2020 Gary Webb Freedom of the Press Award

February 10, 2020 • [44 Comments](https://consortiumnews.com/2020/02/10/julian-assange-wins-2020-gary-webb-freedom-of-the-press-award/#comments)**Save**

**Imprisoned** ***WikiLeaks*** **publisher Julian Assange has been awarded** ***Consortium News’*** **2020 Gary Webb Freedom of the Press Award for courage in the face of an unprecedented attack on press freedom.**

**By** [**Joe Lauria**](https://consortiumnews.com/tag/joe-lauria/)*Special to Consortium News*

**📷\*\*\*\*J**ulian Assange, the imprisoned and maligned publisher of *WikiLeaks,* has been awarded the 2020 Gary Webb Freedom of the Press Award by the board of the Consortium for Independent Journalism, publishers of ***Consortium News.***

Assange is incarcerated in a maximum security prison in London awaiting a hearing later this month on an extradition request by the United States. He has been charged 0n 17 counts under the U.S. Espionage Act of possessing and publishing classified material that revealed *prima facie* evidence of U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

For practicing the highest order of journalism–revealing crimes of the state–Assange faces 175 years in a U.S. prison–a life sentence for the 48-year old Australian. 

Assange, whose life has been [endangered](https://consortiumnews.com/2019/11/23/doctors-petition-uk-home-secretary-over-julian-assange/) in harsh prison conditions, has become an international symbol of the threat to press freedom. He is the first journalist to be charged under the Espionage Act for possession and dissemination of state secrets.

📷

The late Robert Parry.

Robert Parry, the late founder and editor of ***Consortium News,*** was a staunch defender of Assange’s rights. In 2010, he [wrote:](https://consortiumnews.com/2010/121610.html) “Though American journalists may understandably want to find some protective cover by pretending that Julian Assange is not like us, the reality is – whether we like it or not – we are all Julian Assange.”

The award is named after journalist Gary Webb whose life was cut short after the mainstream press vilified him for accurate reports about a CIA operation that flooded urban areas of the U.S. with cocaine from Nicaragua.

Journalist and filmmaker John Pilger, a member of the ***Consortium News*** board, said: “Having been close to Julian Assange through much of his struggle against corrupt power, I had no hesitation in voting for him for the Gary Webb prize. While Gary was a tragedy at the end, Julian must be a triumph.” (....)

I wish to add though that the medical establishment has ruined the trust of certain communities (this is not just America being racist and eugenics oriented, Japanese health ministries have a history of conducting experimenting on its citizens in the 60s at least, and the green cross scandal in the 90s... Oh, and the rampant sexism 😒), therefore we must always be careful about blanket assertions.

kgzc56,"Of course it's an absolute, which is why it's funny 😂. But yeah my problem was ignorance. I was heavily abused as a child and it destroyed me mentally. I have yet to meet anyone that experienced what I did, but it heavily disabled me as an adult. Like, HEAVILY. I never saw myself living past my teenage years as I had my death planned out. However, my two attempts at overdosing lead to owi's. My first owi wasn't an overdose, I was just homeless and sleeping in my car under the influence in the middle of winter and someone called me in. I was driving during one but it was during a week blackout I don't recall with an individual I will never associate again with, and the other I was shopping? I entirely take blame for being an ignoramus. But it's incredible to me. When people speak on the topic of depression, I understand it effects everyone differently. But my depression was soul crushing. It wasn't only psychological, it was physiological. I literally couldn't see color. I was constantly in eternal agony. I would cry for hours and hours. I would hurt myself. I would do whatever I could to feel literally anything. It was the most intense pain and sadness I have ever experienced. I'm much better now. And if I could do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing. It allowed me to understand that a lot of these people might be hurting inside. However, throughout the years I have seen time and time again people going through similar circumstances and not changing. So maybe I'm one in a million here and I'm completely wrong in my beliefs. But I have literally become an entirely different human being when I finally was ready to face my mental issues.

And it's why I'm so politically active. My life was destroyed because I didn't get the help I needed. Partially because of how much our health care costs in this country. But also because my parents literally ignored me crying for help for years. It damaged me to such a degree that I will never have children for fear that I do to them what mine did to me. I love people. I love unique individuals. And I thrive off of helping people. But it kills me when people assume they understand what is going through a person's mind when they commit these crimes. They are selfish crimes, but sometimes the individual is literally unable to see anything else.",2020-12-21 04:35:19

Gets extremely tiring to hear everyone suck up the medical staff now the same way people have always vapidly  sucked up to the military; Lots of virtue signaling, and words, and that's about it(support the troops! 🙄).


For example, I work in a kitchen. No PPe has ever been supplied to me. 
Sometimes I'm forced to wash dishes, and  I feel like this is perhaps one of the positions most likely of all to infect someone doing the job.


My reasoning?   consider two things:  you'd be laughed at if you approached any restaurant manager in my state and told them you needed them to supply you with an actual N95 mask every single day, new whenever necessary. And secondly,  the particulate matter from every single used dish in the entire building, every single day, is flying in your face, in perfect little water droplets and condensation inside the dish pit that you stand in for hours at a time. 



I mean,  how could you *not*contract the virus in this work environment?  At least nurses and medical staff are supplied masks, or *at the very least atleast make enough money to afford them*.


People like me? No ppe supplied, I can't afford it(I'm literally making less money now, both weekly and hourly,  than I was before the virus, forget Hazard pay) and I have to work in a position where, in my mind, I am essentially *guaranteed* to get the virus.",2020-11-01 04:10:55

[The ultra-rich are hoarding as much as $32 trillion ($32,000,000,000,000) in offshore accounts to avoid taxes.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth-idUSBRE86L03U20120722)  As a way to understand just how much 32 trillion is, let's use time as  an example. One million seconds is 12 days, and one billion seconds is  31.7 years. That's already a massive difference between a million and a  billion, but how much is 32 trillion seconds? It's over a million years.

Most people know that wealth inequality is a huge issue, but they don't understand just how bad it is. Here's an example: **If  you had a job that paid you $2,000 an hour, and you worked full time  (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all  of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have  to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much money as Jeff  Bezos.**

I've been  researching this issue for years because I was shocked at just how bad  it really is, and I've put together some information to help illustrate  it.

**Quotes:**  

>**“No business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By workers I mean all workers, and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level, I mean the wages of decent living.""** - Franklin Delano Roosevelt speaking about the minimum wage (it was always meant to be a living wage)

°

>**""The cause of poverty is not that we're unable to satisfy the needs of the poor, it's that we're unable to satisfy the greed of the rich.""** - Anonymous

°

>**""Anyone who believes in indefinite growth on a physically finite planet is either a lunatic or an economist.""** - Kenneth Boulding

°

>**""A century ago scarcity had to be endured; now it must be enforced.""** - Murray Bookchin

°

>**""Capitalism as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of evils. I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion.""** - Albert Einstein

°

>**""If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.""** - Stephen Hawking

**So, what do we do?**

I think the first step is spreading awareness and organizing people. Joining or creating local organizations is always good, and [unionizing is a great thing as well,](https://i.postimg.cc/N06BZt33/12731.jpg) and there are organizations like the IWW that can help you do that.

But honestly I think one of the best things we can focus on is to get behind [the only candidate who has been talking about these issues for decades.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SYxZfksAyco) Although [the media is slandering him,](https://youtu.be/3ZhkKATtqtU) and [completely omitting him from their coverage,](https://imgur.com/a/VyNVA8D) he [actually has the most support,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/02/us/politics/2020-democratic-fundraising.html) and [especially amongst young people.](https://i.redd.it/ybarwig9v5u31.jpg)

The [other candidates](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/24/elizabeth-warren-not-progressive) just [don't stack up.](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/22/pete-buttigieg-just-shill-corporations-and-donor-class)

The public needs to get more involved in politics, and we need to demand that the system works for us, but I think it's important that we have a leader who actually cares about solving these problems because otherwise it's even more of an uphill battle. So register to vote as a democrat, vote for Bernie in the primaries, and get as many other people as you can to do the same. Subscribe to r/WayOfTheBern, r/OurPresident and r/SandersForPresident. And if you're willing and able to contribute money or time then please donate or volunteer for Bernie's campaign. An easy thing you can volunteer for is phonebanking, where you contact people and give them information. There are many things we can do to fix these problems, but the most important thing is to get the right person in the white house, and we have less than 100 days left now. This is not a drill, please get this information out there as much as you can and make sure that people know about these issues and know how to fix them. Thank you for your support, together we can do this!

Boris Johnson mishandles the COVID pandemic and loses millions if not billions in a failed Track and Trace system instead of using Google's/Apple's, as well as giving incompetent companys nationally important jobs that made the COVID pandemic even more difficult.

It's been 12 years of Conservative PMs. Each of them were replaced. Each of them had a hand in ruining the economy and our future with their incessant greed whenever the opportunity arised as well as their never-ending lies. 😮‍💨

To think it took a scandal, which I wasn't even suprised about when I heard it since it's nothing new, to lead to a resignation. As if they have any integrity to be so morally disgusted enough to force a resignation. I just wonder, what are they scheming?

6keeto,">The German parliament, or Bundestag, on Friday passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriages in a snap vote that made it onto the agenda before the summer break after a surprise shift by Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Elections can move things like no other force. 🗳

>The bill passed by 393 to 226, with four abstentions. Merkel herself voted against the bill, although her comments helped bring it about.

So she voted against it to appease the conservatives, and the other demographic is happy anyway that she enabled the voting. Well played.

dvz6z8,"Lol there's a very big chance you say this as a wow sub or OW player who's going to buy the new game. The people who are too weak to even boycott a game company would never actually take the risk of helping in person. The average person is seemingly unwilling to make even minor sacrifices for a cause that doesn't directly affect them or their immediate community - that's what's going to allow China to gradually flex and expand their international influence (like pressuring blizz into censorship) and ""solve"" their little issue with the Uighurs. Then we'll look back in 30 years and go ""nEveR AgAIn😭"".

If you don't play blizz games this rant isn't aimed at you, it's fair to say that the worm-like character of the average gamer is enough to guarantee that no critical mass of boycotters will be reached. But it's still important to be a part of the group that allows the possibility of that mass being reached.",2019-11-14 07:16:34
dvz6z8,"Usually the reasons given for hating South Korea are “they cut diplomatic relations with us in the 90s” (which is weird, because if that’s a reason to dislike a country then theleast favorite country should be somewhere like the UK, who dropped Taiwan like a hot potato back in the 50s) or “they cheated when they won a taekwondo match against us”.   

I hate to say it but if I’m perfectly honest a lot of us have an inferiority complex because we consider ourselves similar to South Korea in many ways (US backed dictatorship that turned democratic, former poor country that is now reasonably rich, former colony of Japan, cultural similarities etc) but South Korea is “better” than us in lots of ways Taiwanese care about :  

⚫︎They are UN members when Taiwan is not.   
⚫︎ They are wealthier than Taiwan 
⚫︎ Their pop culture is very popular around Asia and even the world whereas nobody heard of Taiwan   
⚫︎Their annoying communist neighbor North Korea is a joke, whereas everyone takes China’s opinion very seriously 

That said,Korean soap operas are very popular now, so many people have changed their image of Korea. Several of my classmates have studied Korean or even lived in Korea for awhile, another friend actually tried to take a Korean language class at her university but they had over 200 names on the waiting list.",2019-11-14 02:08:04

Read Peoples History of the United States for detailed example. Chomsky is outspoken on this as well.
If this protest moment is to be effective and have lasting power it needs inspired and dedicated people to set up camp and mine the tactics of resistance from successful movements around the world. And be very very aware that powerful interests are working day and night to convince everyone to go home. Let the kids yell and feel ""empowered"", these monied interests and think-tanks will say. And then let them get tired and go back to the same old wage slavery Matrix that has kept them docile just like they were kept with Bernie or the last BLM, or Occupy or G8 or the Women's March or Climate protest or the protests against the Iraq War and protest against  Nuclear war and protest against Israel, etc etc. These think-tanks study ""the people"" 24/7/365 for just such occurrences.

dh16wp,"> Are you glad that we live in a future where attempting to keep politics out of gaming and entertainment is now demonized. /s

Meh, gaming ""always"" been political (let's not nitpick edge cases) to a larger degree, gamers just tend to ignore politics they are personally detached from. 

You gun terrorists, topple regimes, help secret governments and so on in your generic Battlefield: Modern Spec Ops Warfare, and think that is not political? It is, just politics you don't care about.

But add third gender option, homosexuality or female lead, and it's suddenly ""Muh politics in gaming"" 🙄

I get it, I guess what average person really means is that they don't want ""contemporary local politics"" in their games, because it's already all around them, and they want escapism and a break.

But games are art, and art always been used as a political medium for the creator. Movies, books, crafts. Most of them carry messages that the creators wanted to get across, and games are no exception from that. 

Yeah, seeing same politics in games that you just turned off on CNN can be annoying. Seeing an opinion you disagree with in a game can be annoying. But maybe if people stopped with kneejerk reaction to politics in games, they'd actually learn something new, even if they still disagree with it.

If we want games to be taken serious as an art form, we need to let the whole ""politics in gaming"" thing go.",2019-10-13 07:21:14

There were 27 terrorist attacks from 1994 until now in China ( in total) . Now let's look at US who had 400+ mass shootings just in 2019 . Now I have another question for you: is this about the safety of society? Or is this about maintaining power or sabotage a potential minority who can have a voice/ power?  You keep telling me that I'm naive and that i believe what the media tells me , but you believe that there is a magical ,,educational "" camp in China of all places , and you claim that this is not a concentration camp because China says so , and you don't question why we don't have any photos of said ,, educational'' camp. In the other side , there's testimony  and survivors of said camp, even China had to admit that this camp exists . So again you are  calling me naive , because I believe that China is fucking torturing people based on their ethnicity , and making them slaves , because of said evidence (and common sense as i reached the age of reason ) , while you are saying that this is really a magical secret  educational vocational camp for terrorists? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Funny when the headlines choose to accept that Pompeo represents the US or not—it seems to be largely whether the editorial board agrees with the action.

Frankly I’m not sure what people were expecting, though—they’re in the middle of a massive chinese military, and the US doesn’t have the political capital to engage even in the south china seas. It’s not like China is gonna ask for permission before reclaiming sovereignty.

hwbhtv,"In fact, all they did was commit crimes in the name of religion. The whole thing was a massive defamation of Islam. We (Muslims) are ordered by God to never kill, it is a terrible sin. It’s very sad for me to see those criminals associated with my religion. Muslims just want to be close to God, pray, give charity, and live in peace. Those people are just criminals, God will not forgive their crimes against humanity 🤲🏽.



Edit: There has been a lot of arguing below from people who seem to not really understand Islam. So I’ll just clear some things up for the benefit of my brothers and sisters in humanity.

Firstly, anyone who chooses not to live by the teachings of the Quran and the Sunnah is not a Muslim. Many of the groups you mentioned may claim outwardly to be Muslim, but they simply do not follow the religion so they are not Muslims. It is not something you put on your passport, or a quality to be inherited. Islam is a way of life and an internal state of being.

For example, Saudi Government. Outwardly they claim to be Muslim. However, if you blanket bomb Yemeni innocents and fund terrorist organizations who indiscriminately kill, you are not a Muslim. The Prophet (SAWS), would disown them for these evil actions. These actions are against Islam in every way. These governments are not Muslim, they just use Islam to consolidate power over their populations.

Second of all, the Quran takes many years of disciplined study to fully understand. It is a very complex book. It is not correct or sound to nitpick certain verses from the Quran to prove your point. This reflects a lack of understanding of the book. Many verses are tied to long sections of speech, and the entire section must be taken and analyzed as a whole in order to understand the intended meaning. So I understand how it may seem that certain verses are advising conflict; you should know that these verses were referring to contexts where the Muslims were being attacked, and the arabs were waging war on the Muslims with the intention of driving Islam to extinction. In this sense, God was telling the Muslims to fight back until they can have peace. That’s where these verses originate. In fact, for the first 10 years of Islam, the Muslims were heavily persecuted, tortured, imprisoned, and killed by tribal arabs just because they believed God is one, and the Prophet (SAWS) instructed all his companions to turn the other cheek, and avoid conflict. It was only when God instructed us to fight back that the Muslims took up arms against their oppressors. In times of peace, we must live in peace. So as an extension of my point, the organizations that nitpick these verses as an excuse to kill innocents do not understand the Quran, their interpretations are wrong. They are not Muslim, they use the religion as a crutch to carry out their crimes. Unfortunately, these type of people have defamed my religion. 

Please don’t misconstrue the actions of these organizations to be representations of the correct Islamic viewpoints. Certain things are simply not up for debate in Islam, and the organizations that break those rules are not Muslim.

Historical and other contexts should also be taken into consideration when analyzing some Quranic verses, including the beliefs, practices, and actions of those primitive Arabs who lived with the Prophet (SAWS) at the time. 

Finally, God instructs us not to argue or be argumentative. You can all believe and practice whatever you want, it’s not my responsibility. Oppression is forbidden in Islam. For example, even these stories of women being persecuted for not wearing the Hijab. I sincerely apologize to all of these women and feel bad for the oppression they have faced. This is not Islam, these oppressors don’t follow or understand Islam. They use the religion as a crutch to enable patriarchal oppression.

In Islam, it is not up to any man to force a woman to wear a Hijab. It is up to the woman to choose. My mother is Muslim and she does not wear a Hijab. It is not a law to be imposed by men upon women. The Hijab was a command from God to Muslim women. If a woman chooses to wear a Hijab, that should be her choice. Women wear the Hijab to please God. If she chooses not to, it’s her choice. God forbids us from oppressing anyone or forcing people to follow Islamic teachings. In fact, it is preferred to maintain freedom in societies so whoever chooses to follow god does so by their own free will. That makes for a “fair test” so to speak. Whoever chooses to obey or disobey God should be able to do so by their own free will.

I know it’s hard to separate the truth from the lies. I just know that if you try to understand the religion in its true form, you will come to know it’s beauty. 

Islam is one religion. God orders us to not separate our community into sects as you’ve seen with the Sunni vs Shia situation. The Quran was sent down from God as a guidance for all who are living.

The true religion can be understood by reading the Quran and understanding it in its entirety (not nitpicking certain verses), reading and understanding the practices of our Prophet (SAWS) from authentic sources, and listening to rightly guided trustworthy scholars. 

I wish all of you the best, and hope you can all find peace internally as I have through Islam. ✌🏽",2020-07-23 13:31:21

Don't shove it down other people's throats by imposing some unproven moral system deriving from a book that defends slavery. Your moral system is flawed and essentially it's just a method for you to do whatever you want and just excusing it.

Homosexuality is not immoral. No consistent argument to prove that it's immoral has ever been provided. It has always been ""it's unnatural"" which is fallacious on so many levels, and ""the Bible™"", which again is not an argument (and you'd have to buy into slavery too then).",2021-03-17 10:45:29

I wonder how does the brain of a conservative works where they see daily examples of conservatives being evil, yet think they the evil ones are the liberals. How does that work? They must surely realise that the made-up stories they hear about liberals, compared to the factual conservative ones, aren't quite at the same level cause they are always rumors, right? They are always some hidden conspiracy or whatever... Yet the conservatives are assholes and everyone knows it cause everyone can see it... How is this even a thing? Why are conservatives so blind? 🤦‍♂️ How is right wing propaganda so effective? 

We have seen that it isn't always effective, though, as Russia is scrambling to contain the truth despite being the defacto kings of lies and propaganda...

fxfdg1,"Can attest, this system had me worried at first but my bank account this morning put a smile on my face.

When I was laid off from my job in the service industry, we were told to apply for EI. About a week later the CERB was announced and my previous EI application was automatically moved over to the plan. The application was rocky and there were a couple questions that I had to do some digging around for numbers regarding pay and what-not, but overall the system is helping many Canadians and I am quite satisfied with the financial help the government has given those in need.

One thing I will say is this can easily come back to bite people next year for the 2020 Tax season. Unlike other unemployment benefits, this is NOT taxed from the start and will most likely (depending on your yearly income) owe back in some amount.

TL;DR: CERB works great, just make sure you put away some money for next year. Stay safe 🇨🇦",2020-04-09 00:02:15

fxfdg1,"I’m sure I’m way too late on this but can attest to how easy it was. For background, I’m a Canadian Permanent Resident currently working as a web developer, self employed as a contractor.  Because of covid, i was told that even my second March pay would be delayed up to 90 days for reasons that make sense.  I called the number on [Canada.ca](https://Canada.ca)’s website, hoping to speak to someone to see if my very specific scenario would be covered under the CERB.  Given I still have a job, I was enquiring more as a precaution in case I lost my job all together. My fiancé is still employed too so I didn’t really except anything.   
   So I call the line and it tell me to enter my social insurance number and DOB, thinking that would be used to help verify my identity etc. A message then played, asking whether i attest that I have lost income due to covid, and that if my situation changed I would notify the government. I pressed 1 to agree. The system then said I can expect the $2000 within the next 3-5 days. That was Monday afternoon. I got the money Wednesday morning.

fypgmk,"😂😂😂 wow you're triggered, I'm saying that veganism isn't a dietry choice it's an ethical view point, much like slavery wasn't a consumer choice but an ethical dilemma . Much like with slavery people who stand against eating meat won't just say it's okay for you to do it but I'm not going to, because the issue is against our morals and we'll fight against it. Also like with slavery those who are okay with the status quo didn't think the economy would hold without it. 
I'd also like to remind you how heavily subsidised the meat industry is. Those farmers wouldn't be able to afford their animals and those poor consumers wouldnt be able to afford to buy the carcasses if they weren't. So why wouldn't the government subsidise plants the same way if they were going to change the system? Over grazing, pollution, and the mass amount of water used in animals agriculture is a huge reason lands dry up causing desertification and thus starts a cycle of poverty. Again eating meat is a luxury most of the world cant afford anyway.  Plus I never said animals and humans are equal, but why does that mean we can deny their right to live? And finally, I'll leave you with a question to ponder over  ' If you lived in a society with an over abundance of foods; would you still pay to end animal lives'",2020-04-11 17:47:36

The transition has started. Oil, gas and coal are  finite. We need it for the transition and some other important things in the medical and space industries until there are equal alternatives but fuck sakes...sustainable energy is beyond possible, has been for a looong time, and is getting cheaper as the years go on, and more people who can support it, do! But we need all hands on deck. People, governments, law enforcement. Never in my life have I seen so many people protest against oil in AB's capital. The Legeislature grounds were shoulder to shoulder because Greta Thunburg came and inspired many more than our grassroots group could.  Although, kudos to them for inspiring those they did and for the colab in getting Greta here! 

Inspiration goes a long way and the people who are suing the board are inspiring many many people as we read this. I hope they win because look out!!!!! 

No, I dont need a oil based plastic straw, plastic fork, plastic wrapper inside a plastic wrapper, fuck I dont even need plastic in my clothes.

71nmck,"Does Amazon Prime not exist in Canada? I pay $99/mo for prime (which pays for itself easily within a few weeks of each annual subscription) & then $15/mo for the HBO channel subscription. For the ~2mo/year that GoT airs, that would equate to about $23.25/mo during the season, & then $8.25 for all the other benefits of Amazon prime (free 2 day shipping, Amazon video, & quite a few other premium channels that can now be attained for an additional price for prime members).

Granted it's much cheaper to just pirate the show or wait for the YouTube release, but still...it's an option. If you wanted to be a dick, you can event skip ahead to the end of the episode as soon as it starts when streaming it legitimately, & then spoil it for everyone😈",2017-09-22 04:53:36

nxc9yz,"It is not a swastiká . For fuck's sake , make your christian ass admit that it is a haken kreuz( the hoooked cross )used by medieval german churches.
Hitler used it because he was a devote orthodox CHRISTIAN not a HINDU. He appropriated and edited  a symbol of good luck which was used on half of this Fucking earth. 
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the swastika became well-established in western culture as a good luck symbol, similar to a four-leaf clover or a horseshoe.
 Companies used it as logo; it adorned birth announcements and greeting cards. American Boy Scouts could get a swastika badge, and the Girls’ Club published a magazine called The Swastika. Finland, Latvia and the United States have all used it as a military insignia.
In Canada, a mining community in northern Ontario was named Swastika, just as you might name a town New Hope or Bounty. Windsor, N.S., and Fernie, B.C., both had hockey teams called the Swastikas. In 1931, Newfoundland issued a $1 stamp commemorating important moments in transatlantic aviation; each corner had a swastika.
HITLER IS DEAD NOW but your CHRISTIAN PRIVILEGE of not accepting his CHRISTIAN EXTERMISM💀 IS ALIVE even today.

ty1lrn,"The bill does nothing. These politicians think Canadians are uninformed and unaware. It as easy as wire transferring funds to a foreign student and the foreign student using the funds to purchase real estate. I literally googled International Students buying property and the very first link is from a REALTOR® with RE/MAX Real Estate Brokerage Inc in Mississauga who has posted ""International buyers (overseas parents of students studying in Canada) can either buy a property in cash or secure up to 50% to 60% loan from Canadian lenders secured against the property. The mortgage approval is based on their (parents) income earned in their respective country.  
On top of this, 15% non-resident speculative tax has to be paid. This amount can be claimed back based on the rules."" Bank don't care because they rely on bank accounts, mortgages and loans to operate and profit. This will never curtail foreign investors. If you want to curtail foreign investors, you impose a heavy tax 30% - 45% which can never be claimed back through rebates. The rebates are listed below.

A rebate of the NRST may be available in the following situations:  
  
Foreign national who becomes a permanent resident of Canada – The foreign national becomes a permanent resident of Canada within four years of the date of the purchase or acquisition

  
International student – The foreign national is a student who has been enrolled full-time for a continuous period of at least two years from the date of purchase or acquisition in an “approved institution” (under section 8 of Ontario Regulation 70/17 of the Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities Act) at a campus located in Ontario. Full-time means enrolled in at least 60 per cent (if the individual does not have a disability) or 40 per cent (if the individual has a disability) of what the approved institution considers to be a full course load for the academic year, or

  
Foreign national working in Ontario – The foreign national has legally worked full-time under a valid work permit in Ontario for a continuous period of at least one year since the date of purchase or acquisition. Full-time means an employment position that requires no fewer than 30 hours of paid work per week over a 12-month period and no fewer than a total of 1,560 hours of paid work over that period.

  
To qualify for a rebate, the foreign national must exclusively hold the property, or hold the property exclusively with his or her spouse. The property must also have been occupied as the foreign national’s (and if applicable his or her spouse’s) principal residence for the duration of the period that begins within 60 days after the date of the purchase or acquisition.",2022-04-07 12:22:59

Still, that completely lines up with being on the market for rent in 2 weeks, it’s brutal.

The toughest part for first time buyers is you cannot assume the same risk a corp can. Oh this home actually has structural problems that would have been revealed in an inspection? Well, you’re SOL buddy!  A corp can just rent that out for a few years and then sell it to another corp sight unseen and get their money back (or more). 

Then to compete with these organizations, we’ve got to assume even more risk! Offer well above asking and if the appraisal doesn’t come close then foot that bill instead of making a down payment and only start with 5% equity, spending extra money every month afterwards on interest and PMI to squeeze every drop you’re worth out of you.

The double edged sword is renting gets you nothing in the long run so you’d better just be house poor and eat canned food or else you’ll be fucked when you want to retire. The American dream is alive and well for anyone who already has capital 🙃.",2022-04-07 05:22:02

It’s a good thing the FBI found her and took her into custody before a Black Water level team found her.

t5u29k,"This is not the same as killing within your borders. The countries have sovereignty and sadly we cannot just go and kill liberate and then spend millions unless the world is able to come assist.  

This is an invasion from a democratic country! It’s like the US attacking mexico or Honduras with out provocation or any real justification. 

90 countries voted against. They are given the Ukrainians weapons, money, and opening their homes. Yet we are on the sidelines watching a man burning the world. 

Política needs to be our the door and we should show how America and the world stand up defend and remove threats that are ready to burn everything. 

One man’s choice to fuck it all does not mean he can just do it walk all over. In one week we lost the order we knew. In one week we saw that one little man will do everything to scare and misinformed the world about not going in and then attacking. This is not the choice of a country! Russians are scared because he has been able to escape murder, assassination and he has been able to stay in power, not a dictator or king, but as “elected” president or prime minister. 

He is making fun of our democracy, this is how we were almost distracted by the coup that failed just last year. Try to take power and laughing at us the people because he saw democracy is weak when the people fight against one another and stop listening to all voices and works together. The wealthy know this to exploit the community, the land, and it’s people, but the common man thinks it’s not true. 

Where is the “antinazism,” where is the not attacking the people? Russia’s lie to invade are plainly false. They are lies! They are not in the right side of history our history is being written by what we do today.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

You can’t just ban fracking lol. It’s part of America’s diverse energy portfolio to meet its energy demand. If you ban fracking then the price of energy goes up across the board and who gets priced out of markets... the most vulnerable people of society, that’s who. Those who already can’t afford utilities, who rarely turn the lights on in their homes as it will “save money.” Its black people and people of color, and the economically disadvantaged who will be priced out of energy markets if fracking goes away. The leftists have their hearts in the right place but their solutions are dangerous and unrealistic and not thought through. Their climate plans and policies are all just populist grandstanding to rile people up and don’t really effectively attack and abate the problem of climate change. Biden is right about this issue 💯. Fracking is a necessary energy source in the interim, it allows us to meet our energy demand and keeps energy costs low and reasonable for everyone while the country transitions to greener forms of energy.",2020-11-14 04:49:57

Still had to borrow some extra money from my parents to cover the shipping, since armor plates and carriers are heavy as hell.

When choosing our wedding rings I wasn't given the prices while my husband was for his ring. I thought it was to not put me off choosing the most expensive rings. Nope turns out my ring was 11 pounds that they wouldn't even have an option for insuring it unions my husband's 😅

Though to be fair he only has an expensive ring because I have weird reactions to certain metals like good and they didn't make any big enough in silver.

The 70s fighters are on the way out too.

Yes, the Canadian Forces deserve better and should have more and better equipment. But what they do have and are getting really isn't that bad.

They definitely should be bigger and more powerful though, can't argue that.

rkm5j1,"Haha, I guess I could have elaborated! 😅

I learnt about it in university when discussing evolution/natural selection. Instead of the general idea of ""survival of the fittest,"" or, passing one's genes on directly through sexual reproduction, there is also the concept of ""inclusive fitness"" whereby one promotes the survival/reproduction of shared genes in others. The ""gay uncle"" theory is an extension of inclusive/kin fitness used to [explain homosexuality from an evolutionary perspective](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26089486)

>Paul Vasey's research in Samoa has focused on a theory called kin selection or the ""helper in the nest"" hypothesis. The idea is that gay people compensate for their lack of children by promoting the reproductive fitness of brothers or sisters, contributing money or performing other uncle-like activities such as babysitting or tutoring. Some of the gay person's genetic code is shared with nieces and nephews and so, the theory goes, the genes which code for sexual orientation still get passed down.",2021-12-20 19:39:08

Russia invade what 3-4 places last 50 years and one of then countries dont fit the world narrative, so media riles up the world against russia, world sends weapons and USA even sendt 40billion+ in cash that they dont even need to prove what it goes to....but yeah people really wonder why russia react as they do😂

Fuking hypocrites most of the world tbh, and it also prove how god damn racist the world is also, USA drone shot a civilian kid to death in the middle east ""oh well its the way it goes"" russia rekts a kid "" my god we got to send more militairy equipment to ukraine AND money, russia is the worst country in the world, MORE SANCTIONS!!!??""

What pisses me off most is when media go "" russia blew up a hospital and killed 50 people"" yeah sound horrible and you wonder how many pasients was killed, when they say 50 you think about 40 patients 10 docs and nurses, but when you actually dig a bit into the story you find out 50 of the people was militairy as they used the hospital as a meeting place, just like they done with alot of schools, each time a school get blown up to, unless the media write ""kids"" and just write ""people"" instead, then you can bet your ass the militairy used it as a base.

At this point im not sure what pisses me off most, peoples hypocisy or the media who try to push a narrative when they should be neutral and just report the fuking news about how things really are.

Yeah i know this doesnt fit what the media told you, so im gonna get voted down, but atleast this might make a person or two actually bother to search some stuff up without blindly beliving media and follow anything it tells you to.

Next time do ask your self this when you see on the news "" Putin blew up a school/hospital"" if he want to kill civilians he could just shot rockets into the parts of ukraine thats not in middle of fighting wich is far from the areas thats contested, its alot more civilians there.

You dont shot a school in a area thats in middle of fighting if your after civilians, as its no kids in that school, no sane country would send children to school where militairy is fighting right outside, civilians would be evacuvated and those who stay would stayed innside, not gone to school as teachers would be evacuvated to, so if you blow a school up in a contested area, its because its used as a stronghold.

People really need to get their heads out of their asses, if you didnt go apeshit over all the crazy experiments USA done om blacks in the past, all the wars and civilian kills USA got up to now, then your a fuking hypocrite for going apeshit now.

And before anyone try to go "" your a russian"" im not, im from norway, but i dont just blindly belive what the tv tells me to belive, i always read up both sides of the story when media push something as hard and they did with Corona and now russia, it takes you 10-20 min of your life to search out both sides and see whats what, then make your self a opinion, hearing just one side and going with it just makes you a sheep.",2022-05-22 11:57:41

ntre3z,"I visited the American Military Cemetery at Omaha Beach in Normandy in 2018 on Independence Day, and it was moving in more ways than I could have imagined.

There were so many people there. I couldn't spend a ton of time in the museum on site unfortunately, but I was immediately moved by how incredibly well-kept the grounds were.

There was a table at the entrance that a French organization - I think their name was Le Memoirs de la Fleur - had set up to hand flowers out to the visitors for them to place on the grave of whomever they wished. There were 2 older Frenchmen and 2 younger ladies in their 40s or so (perhaps their daughters) at that table.

The older gentlemen came up to the 4 of us (all Americans) and spoke the thickest French I had ever heard, almost knowing we wouldn't understand them. But they were so earnest and emotive while speaking to us that I'm sure I understood their gratitude before their daughters gave us the introduction in English. I wondered later if those older men were children living in Normany at the time.

There were museum curators walking around with binders of photos offering to tell stories of those buried there and of their families to anyone who wanted to hear. It was *so* cool to watch a family from Australia hear a story so much like stories I'd heard from my grandpa (a WW II vet).

The meaningfulness of how well the French had maintained the grounds hit me very swiftly. I swear, there was not a blade of grass out of line. My grandpa was still alive when I went there, and it meant so much to see the honor, thoughtfulness, and care out into everything from the design and creation to the maintenance of the entire place. It was pristine.

I want to go back and spend an entire day there... But now that my grandpa's gone, I'm sure it's gonna hit me quite differently. 😣",2021-06-06 20:16:18

j9shub,"Facebook is a private company. It is not your right to be here; it is your privilege to be here. They have the right to refuse service to anyone they wish for any reason.  Moreso, you agreed to it because it is in Facebook's terms of services, which require your acceptance to join Facebook.

The same people ""crying me a river"" about ""censorship"" are the same people who argue it is their ""right"" to shop at a privately owned business, without a face mask.  You have no such right, as it is only a privilege to do so, and the moment you put someone else at risk (or believed to be at risk), they have the right to refuse service.

p1t5ae,"Oh trust me, Anti Vax and Q and other conspiracies are also quite big here. 

I have a feeling it's especially bad since last year when movement called ""Querdenker"" (loosely translated would be ""opposite thinker"", and trust me, they don't have much to do with thinking). It's this movement that protests against Corona measures and the goverment.

It consists of Anti Vaxxers, Reichsbürger, Neo Nazis and unfortunately, it seems a lot of radicalized Normies that never really had much to do with Science.
They are victims of disinformation and thus they are not just Anti Vax, but now also believe in so many other conspiracies... often shockingly in the JQ.... as freaking Germans...

My sympathy stops with them when they have no problems with protesting side by side with Nazis and people who wave the German Imperial Flag, which itself is also just a dogwhistle because it's a crime to wave flags of the 3. Reich here. 
Ofc these people will tell you they just want back the Empire. It's funny, they are against the vaccine and ""overarching"" control of the government and mandatory vaccine, yet want back the Empire in which vaccines against smallpox were mandatory. BAHAHA
 
Oh and of course actual Neo Nazis use the same flags in their marches.
I mean it was pretty telling when Atilla Hildmann shouted off his extreme anti semitism, anti EU and pure Nazi talk and everyone there just cheered as if he didn't just said some despicable shit.

You may have heard of this movement because there was this one viral incident where one small girl compared herself to Anne Frank because she couldn't celebrate birthday with all her friends at once and instead had to have several birthday parties. You can't make this shit up, 100% her parents made her say that, the same people who say ""Save the Children"" but then also use them as shields against water cannons to make the operators hesitate. That actually happened.

And then there was this other very viral vdeo with another girl, a bit older maybe 17. She compared herself to Sophie Scholl and then a stage worker had enough and called her out on her bullshit and she started to cry and run off the stage. It was glorious. No sympathy, you don't get to compare yourself to someone like Sophie Scholl, that's sooo disrespectful. And she was old enough to know better.

Nowadays the movement is quite in shambles because the leaders (which are pretty much just some conspiracy nuts on social medias with a following and pseudo intellectuals) are all opportunistic assholes and it was inevitable after lie after lie and some scandals. Every bigger one got banned from sites like Twitter, and ofc that's all ""censorship"" so they all now have Telegram channels where they jerk off each other share absolute bullshit and lure in more victims that got in a rabbit hole from the YT algorithm that suggested more and more extreme political channels for example.

That happened to my mother and I'm so infinitely frustrated and angered because of this.
She's one of the normies, she's not a racist and never was an anti semite, yet even she once said after being radicalized ""and yeah, did you know Angela Merkel is jewish... yep!"" clearly talking about the JQ in context and I completely lost and and told her to think about think about what she just said. I tried to talk about the science with her, and she knows I was always a science oriented and interested in it, and it's just so frustrating when you have all the facts and you KNOW you are right about something but it does nothing to change someones mind because they insist on their opinion.

End of the story is I ended up cutting connections and told her you have to realize you're being radicalized yourself, nobody in this family cares about it, only I do and I fear what will happen. I tried everything and made the ultimatum to choose between what's more important for her.

Anyways sorry for the tangent here man.. I just had to get this out somehow.

The movement eat themselves nowadays and they all end up in different groups. But the core tenets is still alive and of course the people didn't realize they were taken advantage of.

It's a bad situation here, because I feel like in english YT and media you have enough people who debunk that shit. We also have this here, but less, we have so many fewer GOOD people who hold against and fight against radicalization on Social Media I feel like. 

So many people here that are left leaning and write columns and what not are fucking cringe and they kinda do push people to the right because it's so easy to dunk on them. Just shut up about man spreading already f.e. rest of the world already moved on.
I know a few good ones but it's not enough. 

Just every news site, the comments there are bloated with anti science and disinformation. On every single YT upload of news reports the same, often so much the comments are closed from the beginning because it's just too much and spreading everywhere. Not that enough people who do something against that would stop it.. but kinda.. slow it down? Deradicalize them? Idk man maybe I'm a doomer and I'm frustrated because this shit happened in my own family and I can't forgive myself for not stopping it when I had the chance.

a21lfl,"https://www.historyofvaccines.org/index.php/content/articles/vaccine-injury-compensation-programs

Most of the data here is from a non biased side and points out the fact that there’s links to certain diseases but they chose to not include such data. 

“Autism Omnibus Proceeding

Beginning around 2001, hundreds and then thousands families began to petition NVICP claiming that their children’s autism resulted from vaccination. (See the article The History of Anti-vaccination Movements, and specifically the section “The Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine Controversy” for a discussion of the origin of these claims.) To deal with the volume of these petitions, and to address the assertion that a causal relationship existed between vaccination and autism, the NVICP established a special program in 2002 called the Omnibus Autism Proceeding, housed within the U.S. Court of Federal Claims Office of Special Masters.

The OAP consolidated many of the autism claims into three test cases that rested on different theories of causation. The first test case addressed the issue of whether measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine alone or given along with thimerosal-containing vaccines (TCVs) is a causal factor in development of autism. (Thimerosal is an ethylmercury compound that was a common preservative in some killed vaccines.) The second test case examined TCVs alone. The third test case was to look solely at MMR vaccines, but the case was withdrawn after parties announced that they would rely on the findings of the first test case.”

Basically “we’re going to disregard ALL of the data in favour of what data we can use to maximize our profit” 

This is the main reason that people are against harmful chemicals being used on their children, the suppression of data in favour of profit. Don’t forget the world you live in is one of profit above all, if they can get away with it and make a killing (no pun intended) they absolutely will. 

Most of the harmful ingredients are all chemical by-products. Again companies trying to maximize their profit. 
Thimerosol which has been removed from a number of vaccines but still used is “safe” for the amount they use. They use 25 micrograms and going by weight of an infant they would need to way about 550 lbs for that level of mercury to be safe, whether it stays in the body permanently or not. Again, chemical by-product being sold to you in the form of tax.

Adjuvant- aluminum salts are supposedly non toxic, but the rise in neurological diseases would seem to prove otherwise, cases of Alzheimer’s and autism are directly related to heavy metals in the brain. And unless all of these people are eating tuna/salmon everyday or work in a factory, where else would they be absorbing such high levels of aluminum so frequently? Again another chemical by-product

Stabilizers-sugar-gelatin and we are again another by-product going into vaccines. 

Egg proteins- to grow the bacteria required to absorb, this one is probably the least worrisome of them all but still a by-product of animal farming. 

Formaldehyde-Aside from ALS risk or other nervous system consequences, formaldehyde is a respiratory irritant that causes chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, and nose and throat irritation, according to the ATSDR. It can also cause cancer, and has been linked to an increased risk of asthma and allergies in kids. Sound like your asthma prone child to you? 
Some argue that formaldehyde exists in nature which is true but in extremely low amounts not nearly as high as a single vaccine, let alone 30 of them. 

Neomycin- this one comes from the FDA.
“This drug can harm your kidneys, ears, and nervous system, including your brain. This can happen even if you take this drug at the dosage your doctor prescribes. Your risk of kidney damage is even greater if you already have kidney problems. Ear damage or hearing loss can start after you stop taking this drug. Your doctor will make sure you’re a good candidate for this drug before prescribing it for you.”

Vaccines originally did not contain any of these chemicals, they consisted of fluid for transfer and the inoculated tissue/blood sample for building antibodies. Now it’s a for profit campaign (some say there’s worse and bigger motives but we’ll keep it purely about the angle of profit) pharmaceutical companies sell you side effects so that they can also sell you the treatment. 
Whether you want to believe this or not is a matter of fact and not opinion. 
The people who invented the original mass vaccines didn’t have the foresight to see their invention to the people as something that could be used against them one day so they left no patent on it, wanting it to be free for everyone, some think it is because you can get your vaccines from McDonald’s 🙂🙃 but it’s paid for by your tax and even when a child is harmed by these products the money they give to the victims is coercion  to stay quiet (if you accept the money you cannot pursue them in court) also money given from the tax payers. 

Let’s be clear, they work as intended. And they intend for you to come back for the next shot and the next and the one to fix what they gave you in the first, 2nd, 30th.

With the exception of tuna casserole. 🤢 That’s a good item, which is all I think of (in terms of food) when someone says casserole. Next you’re gonna tell me there’s more than just tuna casserole.

Christ, what kind of rock have I been living under?",2021-10-20 20:15:30
qc6ihy,"It’s basically anything that is a large pan of food cooked (usually baked) into one dish, and serves as a meal – e.g. tater tots, hamburger, cheese, corn, green beans, all served in one big ass pan. It’s usually layered, so using the above example, you might have like a layer of tots, then a mixture of hamburger and veggies (and something like cream of mushroom soup, maybe), then another layer of tots and cheese.

Apparently you would know it as a “casserole”, judging by the other comments, if you haven’t guessed that already.

Which is weird, I don’t think my mind applied the notion of “casserole” to anything other than A) the pan itself, or B) tuna casserole.

And I loathe tuna casserole.

Edit: Jesus Christ, I just googled it and Wikipedia more or less describes the dish above as an example, too. *This was a childhood staple for me.* **I still make this when I won’t have time to cook for several days.**

^(Or just want to be lazy.)

We had more than that, though. Some were kind of like pizza, except layered over and under thick bread (bisquick was common, so you’d do bisquick batter, sauce + cheese, pepperoni or sausage chunks, maybe some more cheese in a defined layer, bisquick batter, sauce + cheese, pepperoni or sausage chunks, maybe another layer of cheese, bisquick). Could also throw in some veggies with the sauce + cheese, e.g. I love black olives and banana peppers, so that usually ended up in this.

Great Aunt Barb always did one with wild rice, mushrooms (🤢), ground hamburger, and I think soy sauce?

Great Aunt Maryanne’s invariably involved copious amounts of pork and potatoes, and almost always involved baked beans, so I just avoided it because I am not fond of baked beans.

All sorts of shit. Basically anything you could cook into a single large dish, throw in the oven, take somewhere, and feed multiple people.",2021-10-20 20:21:12

g8xh3m,"Hi this post is for the people of panet earth who are scared rn

Mainstream media (MSM) show anecdotal cases of that doctor who died of covid and look at how sad the family is and what a hero and omg anyone who gets covid19 will die a painful death and hundred of thousands have died - without giving statistical context - THIS IS NOT NEWS IT IS THE CREATION OF A NARRATIVE. 

This is a carefully constructed narrative designed to impact ur base human emotions and create fear thru a tragic and scary and sad story and Fear is the currency of control. 

So. I got tired of being scared af and I decided to pull real data (cia website, and index mundi) from various sources and use my own judgement. Here is what i learned (and coincidentally what is not readily promoted and covered by the MSM):

In 2018 about 60million ppl died on this planet
Of that 8 million died from respiratory illnesses

I do not know if close to 300,000 deaths in the span of 5 months is significant. I am not a doctor or infections specialist. 

In mid-March The british government (on their website) stated that covid19 was no longer considered a HCID (high consequence infectious disease). Shortly after that they imposed strict lock down measures on the whole country. 

The only formal way u can determine cause of death is by performing an autopsy. They are worried about post mortem spread of covid19 and are not allowing autopsies to be performed. 

The US surgeon General in mid april announced that the us would no longer be adhering to WHO protocol for how to deal with covid19 and instead would be looking at the data they have been collecting to make decisions going forward (this waa not covered by ANY MSM - i heard about it and then found the interview on fkng SoundCloud) - search for it (not on google try duckduckgo n u should b able to find it) 

Sweden did not impliment strict lockdown policies - they are not doing relatively worse or better than most nations in terms of deaths and number of cases.

Lastly, a quarantine is when u seclude the sick and the weak.. This is not a quarantine it is mass house arrest leading to economic ruin mainly for the most vulnerable people on our planet (interesting fact - the populations that will be most impacted economically by covid are those working in sectors that were expected to lose jobs in the near futuree due to automation) 

I can go on and on and on... Main point is if u think that magic box on ur wall is just there to inform you and show u the facts - u r not being critical enough about ur existence and reality of this planet. Someone is just spoonfeeding u what they want u to think and u are happily eating it without questioning why or digging deeper than just the 5oclock news

Question everything u r told. Do ur own research. Dont let fear be the reason u give up ur liberties.

Something to just ask urself:

Trillion dollar bailouts/ hyper inflation/ economic ruin vs immediate and effective testing to determine the real mortality rate and then create policies accordingly (don't know the cost but can guarantee it is significantly less than the first option) ..... So as a reasonable logical person i am sure u would chose the later option bc it makes a lot of sense right?? so why the fuck isnt our government doing that???

We have infinite $ to make sophisticated bombs n kill other humans but cannot roll out logical and adequate mass testing...  Why???

Esteemed,

This was the last time you opened your mouth about CR! Your behavior has substantially crossed the lines of what is diplomatically acceptable. You dare to threaten Senate Chairman with heavy price, you unmannered rude clowns!

Now listen to me, comrade minister. PRC will apologize ASAP for the shameless threat. And when I say ASAP, I mean right now! I want to have it in 24 hours on the table of Czech foreign minister. Btw, he agrees with me, but has to keep his mouth shut because of the pact of not very sane mercenary Miloš Zeman with our premier, co-conspirator Babiš. But that doesn't mean you will bully us like this.

Be ashamed and acknowledge that in the future, even a tone which would implicate threat towards  representatives of our sovereign country will make you pay a heavy price for bullying, and you won't like it. You will not train us from position of strength and I warn you that reaction from our side will be the same even if you had invested 14x more than our friends from Taiwan instead of 14x less.

Wake up. You will not shit on us. Do not let this to be repeated.

Send me the copy of the apology on email, so I can put it in archives and forget your pathetic diplomatic fuckup you have just made. Don't piss me off.

il6dxq,"IM ACTUALLY SO FKING SAD THAT YOU LEFT, WHAT THE FUCK :’(

Especially now during such politically fked times, I have always believed in the EU... Their whole idea is just for everyone to be ”as one” and to help eachother, which we all need as a species really to advance and overcome problems (bigger than Corona) such as global warming... EU was a great step towards that (in Europe at least) that turned out to work really well for most of us, apparently.

Sure there are issues, but nothing is perfect I guess.. I mean just the fact that we have complete open borders is crazy by itself, and now they removed roaming for mobile networks. Which basically means that you can use your phone/tablet, with your own ”home country” data plan/sim card, exactly like at home with no extra charges added... Internet and all. This completely changed all EU travel for me. Me being thankful to politicians is super rare lol, but kudos to them!

The majority of which are old white rich men, who have lived a life that is completely out of touch with the other 99.9% of the population.
To make it worse, they've somehow convinced thousands of angry, frustrated and gullible people here to vote in favour of them. Many of these voters would NEVER have been caught voting for them if it had not been for something as divisive as Brexit.
The conservatives have somehow convinced many of our poorest, low income, low educated communities to vote for them; the party that continously works to strip financial aid/benefits away from these very people... it's fascinating to watch, and utterly depressing.

ro8ykb,"It's so bizarre. As an average person I look up to these geniuses as people who won't fail. ""We have the science and decades of experience"", I think to myself.

But as a programmer I know how many things can go wrong. No matter how many times I check my code, I keep slipping up every now and then. 

Even if 100 people looked at my code and ran 1,000 tests, they might forget to test for something obvious like missing punctuation or a lowercase L instead of an uppercase i.

I feel like something with so many ways to fail is extremely risky. I have to trust that they knew what they were doing and ran tests and simulations for every possible thing that could go wrong up there.

The info is there for people to see, it’s not my opinion, that’s the truth.  Do vaccines cause health or mental problems? Well it’s already been proven 💯 in some cases yes they absolutely do. So you’re basically playing roulette with them even though the chances are minuscule something will happen. 
Are vaccines even effective? That’s a debate very much open for discussion. The arrogance from supporters of vaccines is mind numbing because of these facts.

molk5p,"Most Russians believe that being gay is kinda contagious, like it is some sort of moral/soul corruption. My guess is that the majority (or close to it) believes that gay people are created when they are abused/anally raped, such as in prison, and possibly as the result of drugs, sleeping around, and other ""immoral"" behaviour. 

It sounds ridiculous, and it is, but IMO this belief comes from the Orthodox authorities in the country (which go hand in hand with the government), and I think most people are religious. The government loves this, because for them, if they can get rid of gay people being obviously gay, more offspring will be created (and hey, it sorta works... People are afraid to come out of the closest and have families because they have to). 

The birth rate has been falling in Russia for years, and abortion rates are kind of enormous (the highest in Europe, IIRC). The government's attempts to increase the birth rate have taken all sorts of ugly forms, such as when hell-bitch Mizulina successfully led the 2017 legislation that decriminalisated domestic violence (I shit you not. I cried that day and remember it well), with the reasoning being that putting violent husbands behind bars hurt families.

If you look at it from that point of view: gay parents obviously create gay children, therefore trans parents (who may be even worse than gay people, since they violate hwat God made in his wisdom) will create trans children and spread the sickness further.

Most people will agree and see it as their moral duty to prevent such things from occurring.

Source: am Russian with Orthodox parents. As a teenager, I argued with my mother about homosexuality and she let me know in no uncertain terms that she would have disowned me if I'd been a lesbian. I have a trans sibling, and my mother has also talked about putting them into a re-education facility. It's grim, and as crazy she she is, she isn't even that bad, compared to millions of others. We live in the West now and she constantly whines about going back home, probably because she doesn't like it in ""Gay-ropa"" (derisive term some people call Europe). I hope she does that someday.

My classmates were also religious and homophobic. I know plenty of people who are progressive, but unfortunately they are in a minority.

Fuck the Russian church. They rose like some sort of shit-phoenix after the USSR crumbled, and the reality is that they never went away.

I am fucking terrified that, one of these days, they'll ban abortions. Feels like the next step to me. 😱",2021-04-11 19:55:00

Why, ask him.   This is now the Russian Empire, In the holy protection of mother Mary, Mother of God.  And if he committed the sin of murder, it is between him and God.

The current threat is biological warfare, and if it is determined it was a deliberate act of biowarfare against the world, it will be world war.

Joe Biden is an excommunicated Catholic and abortionist, he is thoroughly corrupted and a career liar and mass murderer who signed off on hit lists with Obama every morning, killing hundreds of thousands of Muslims, decimating thousands of square miles, turning entire cities, towns and villages into concrete jungles of rubble, to be picked off at night by Apache gunships and ac 130 gunships turning them into splatters on infrared, and now the truth is revealed in the skies,  in dolce, deep underground, is a bunker that spans 4 states underground run by huge nuclear reactors, that can raise cattle, chicken crops for decades until the fall out is gone, enough for 80,000 people,  all that surplus grain the us produces and the “government” buys goes to feed these cattle, pigs, the best of the best, deep underground there are aliens and those aliens are harbouring a talking snake 🐍 named Lucifer, who poisoned the apples 🍎 that Eve ate and gave to Adam, the deceiver, the Satan, and here we are, ready to face nuclear Armegeddon, a declaration of world war to topple the largest atheist communist regime on earth and free 1.2 billion people from the grips of communist atheism, is the plan of Lucifer, all God wants is an apple in his mouth to shut him up once and for all.  Thou shall not kill said God, he alone is the creator and destroyer of life, body and soul.  No one else is permitted to kill unless it is to defend your life or the life of others.  

If the Chinese released the wuhan virus 🦠 on purpose and almost 4 million people died because of it,  then that’s 4 million families that want payback and to make sure they never do that again and the only way is to topple the regime and free the 1.2 billion people from communist atheist rule.

o1cpkh,"Putin does not care about them or about BLM. They are all convenient pawns in his attempt to make the US look hypocritical. He knows it’s transparent and he knows he’s contradicting himself. It doesn’t matter to him; by merely uttering “whataboutism” in response to his accusations, we acknowledge our sins and that’s enough for him. The basic argument would be something along the lines of:

“BLM - triggered by American racism -  caused disorder: how can a dysfunctional American state, torn apart at the very seams, tell Russia what to do?”

Terrible logic but we do make ourselves look bad with race relations. Russia, like almost any other country in the world, can play holier than thou with us because our history is so well known and the civil rights movement was so internationally pivotal, despite being localized. This is low hanging fruit and people have commented on the old Soviet tactic of firing racial salvos. 


Another tactic the Russians will use is that they’ll even cut the nose to spite the face: 

“You’re trying protestors who organized violence targeting their own government (yes, we just spoke against BLM protesters wreaking havoc, but now it serves us to support these protesters because painting a picture of repression makes you look bad). This is unfair! Where’s your freedom™️? But if it *is* fair, then I too can take steps to protect my country from dangerous demagoguery (even if I trump up the charges against my foes)”. 

The error we make is to project our politics on Putin. “He’s a conservative” I’ve seen people write. What does that mean, really? Do you really believe that there’s real political alignment between Putin and American conservatives beyond a few superficial points? Putin and company are playing a whole different ballgame out there and they’re nobody’s friends. Our morals, ethics and general world view don’t align.

Edit: you'll see many angry Japanese tweets going ""he's former military, not current and therefore not real military personnel!! 😡"" I have 0 idea why that distinction makes any difference, he's simply being reported as former military to explain his ability to diy and use a shotgun, and former military personnel who fulfilled their contract are still very much"" real"", just not currently serving

Edit 2: after reading a bunch more tweets and qrts, I get it now lol, japanese ""self defense military"" is considered to be mostly right wing, so the angry right wing Japanese twitter is not wanting to admit that ""one of their own"" shot up a right wing politician, but now there's a lot of tweets angry at the aforementioned right wingers, ""former military aren't real military??

vu65y6,"> dit: you'll see many angry Japanese tweets going ""he's former military, not current and therefore not real military personnel!! 😡"" I have 0 idea why that distinction makes any difference, 

Because Japan had a string of political assassinations and coup attempts by army officers in the pre WW2 era. They shook the nation and led to some bad things. Some very bad things. The distinction is that he is not active duty is being made to reassure a shocked and scared public. Military personnel are very much going to want to distance themselves from the killer. 

Any gun death in Japan is shocking and upsetting when you live there because it's normally so safe. It's not like the US where 20 children get shot beyond recognition on a Wednesday and people have collectively forgotten about it by the weekend. This is a traumatic event for Japan and people are going to react in various often emotional ways afterwards.",2022-07-08 12:34:02

Who really cares what the rest of the world thinks. Trump doesnt and neither should other countries. Oh wait now the other countries will have to pay extra without the 🇺🇸. In my opinion he should leave the UN to. The most corrupt over paid organization in the world. UN is pushing hard for world govt and believe me it wont be a democracy. Imagine a unelected world govt.

We’re part of a group that plays a video game, and a few months back when we were together someone made the mistake of bringing up Trump and asking him if he had voted for him. He said yes, and then proceeded to say it’s because the US has like 60 million illegal immigrants, Democrats are all in support of illegal immigration, they keep bringing out these women that claim he sexually assaulted them, the impeachment is fake (this was around the time when they were starting the process with hearings).

It was sad because up to that point I had really liked him but once you see that, you just can’t unsee it.

The media likes to imply we are all crazy, gun happy, Covid19 infected nuts.  We are not we have a shit show that has become our current political system. 

While a majority of us take responsibility for basically being lazy and allowing this storm to happen. I believe I speak for most when I say we are fucking over it. 

Give us a few years and we will show the world what we are made of. We are rebels and we won't go down with out a fight. 

My country is flawed and has made many mistakes along the way. We are still a young nation but, we are a proud nation. We love more than we don't, we rise up and we do work together when we are united.

There is this illusion right now that we are divided, but from my own personal experience I can say that's not true. I have seen communities pull together to help each other. I have seen people give the shoes off their feet to those with out. I have hope and faith in our country. 

We are not sinking we are just going through a rough time right now. But, I truly believe that the American people will step up, wake up and get their shit together. 

How we get there is our choice will we finally take off the blinders and unite as one? Or will we continue to sit back and wait for our government to save us?

I'm going to go with the 1st. So sit back world and watch the fireworks. It's going to be one hell of show!

And no I'm not some ignorant American who is blinded by the so called American Pride. 

I love our people and our country. We have a beautiful country and great people. We are friendly and we are just trying to survive this disaster. 

All I am saying is don't write us off yet and don't give up on us. We may just surprise the world in the end.

k7ajwz,"Ugh...If he really wanted to keep Manitobans safe, he wouldn't have forced schools to reopen in fall without a plan, would have hired enough people to do contact tracing, would have gotten on board with the covid app early on, would have removed his anti-masker/anti-vaxxer pandering health minister from cabinet, and would have done a proper lockdown early on so that people could actually get together for the holidays rather than plugging money into that shit shoot that was the ""restartMB"" campaign. This Grinch wanted businesses and workplaces to stay open early on and made such remarks as ""the best social program is a job"" in response to individuals losing their jobs in response to the pandemic,rather than provide any real assistance. Everything had to come from the federal government, who he lambasted on every occasion that he could. He and his government are responsible for the outbreaks we have been experiencing in care homes, and they could not even ensure access to non expires PPE until recently. It should also be noted that he created the insufficient health care infrastructure. He cut healthcare jobs, closed down ERs and urgent care centres, and is now trying to shut down two cancer care centres in the midst of a pandemic 🙄.

One can be uneducated and being ignorant on a subject with out being a idiot.

Classic disparaging remark by a politico, borderline abusive.

Let’s just all pretend that the current situation is not the fault of the education system.

An idiot is someone lacking intelligence to the point they cannot learn anything. Someone with an IQ about 85. An actual disability.

So according to that abusive person a good portion of the population is intellectually disabled?

k7ajwz,"No, masks protect other people from the viruses you have. Meaning if someone close to you is infected and wearing the mask improperly, the mask you're wearing wont do much to stop it. 

Masks on their own aren't 100% effective either. That's why we need to stay 6 feet away, to further lower the chance of infection. 


The reason most masks only work one way, is because unless the mask is a respirator, air and water droplets can still enter your mask from the outside. One-way masks are able to capture the moisture you breath from your nose and mouth, making it safe for other people. However, when you breathe in, you're sucking in air from the open gaps between your nose and your eyes. 


[Respirators](https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/prevention/ppe/surgical_mask.html#:~:text=Respirators%20protect%20from%20exposure%20to,splashes%2C%20droplets%2C%20and%20spit.&text=Respirators%20are%20designed%20to%20seal%20tight%20to%20the%20face%20of%20the%20wearer.) are able to filter the air you breathe, lowering the virus's ability to pass from one person to the next.

Hello.  
  
I have removed this in protest. Starting July 4th, 2023, I am doing my own movement. No links, no gimmicks, no money bs. I am simply taking my own actions.  
  
I have silenced all notifications, removed every bit of information as I can from my profile. I replaced emails/numbers linked to the account that I don't care for. This is a two part protest; the later being that I scorch-earth the accounts on Jan. 1st, 2024.  
  
I am done with this digital age where we are exploited for views, comments, and efforts ; efforts that we as the people put our labor into building this community. A wonderful online community where we can share ideas, be true to ourselves and seek to improve ourselves through the help of others. Whether it's to seek compassion, companionship or to be entertained; we have all been linked by such an incredibly powerful and wonderful tool; the internet.  
  
After July 4th, I will never return to my accounts on these platforms: Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. I will copy and paste this info everywhere I can until the 4th.  
  
I am in control of who contacts me, who I want to grow with, forge friendships and interact with. I am in control of what I want to express my interests in, likewise is applied to those whose viewpoints differ from my own.  
  
Diversity is what makes us, us. It's who we are in our values, beliefs, norms and behavior. I will not standby as these efforts are exploited; exploited beyond anything I have ever seen in the past 35 years.  
  
This is not goodbye, farewell or so-long. I fully believe we will cross paths again. A peaceful but impactful revolution needs to happen. This is a critical moment for me and I will not allow greed to win. This is our culture. Lines have been crossed.",2022-02-26 23:24:54

Yes it’s damaging to our economy, but economy isn’t everything. Times like this have made me realise having having total control over our country is more important than ever.

fx63w7,"This is 💯 true.

I'm a normal person and I knew about it at the start of December. I bought stuff from a factory in Shanghai and I had a message from the supplier telling me about it and not to worry as it's not air born. Yeah I think Trump knew and I know my UK knew about it as well.

Then it was on the news in the middle of December and then it only exploded in January/February.

Ask yourself why did each country not shut down there borders and no flights in or out and any person coming home would need to be quarantined for 14 days before being allowed re entry to the country. Why was this not done the minute Covid 19 was confirmed in China?

This would be the natural response. It's not that fucking hard to know that's what should have been done. So why wasn't it.

America and the UK where the two slowest countries to react to the virus. What more proof did they need when they seen Italy and Spain?. Both of us never ordered enough test kits or protection kits. We don't have enough ventilators. So when you go to the hospital and there's 1 ventilator left and there's 2 of you needing it then it's a case of picking and choosing who dies and who doesn't.

Our figure's are way off because they aren't counting anyone who is at home self isolating and has the virus but overcomes it (like I did myself) these people aren't being tested or asked who they were in contact with etc. 

The vaccine that is being worked on as well. 
So we are vaccine daft for simple things like measals and the mumps which in this day and age aren't that bad, yet we can't come up with a vaccine to prevent this virus. It's not a new virus it's from SARS virus and that was also leaked from China years ago. What are scientist doing that there not working on new and evolving diseases globally.",2020-04-08 17:28:25

(2) Instead of acknowledging the inherent wisdom of preparing for a pandemic, he dissolved the department because, “I don’t want to pay people to stand around and do nothing!” His moronic, ego-centric Adderall-addicted mind is sinking into the depths of despair.

They're satanist baby murderers after all! They can't win through superior policies - instead they win solely because they're not Democrats. If you make your opponent out to be the embodiment of Satan, you're automatically Jesus.

Democrats want better immigration laws to simplify and streamline the immigration process? No, Democrats want OPEN BORDERS so that ILLEGAL ALIENS can replace you and take your job and your taxpayer money!!

Democrats want to raise taxes on the rich, feed the income into social programs for the betterment of society, and lower taxes on the working class? No, they want to raise YOUR taxes and raise your boss' taxes so he fires you, and they pocket it!!!

Democrats want to legalize early on abortions, and they don't want to abort late term unless absolutely necessary? No they're BABY MURDERERS that use CHAINSAWS to CUT BABIES IN HALF!!!

See? I, R-/u/coromd, am the superior option. I don't steal your jobs, your money, or kill widdlr cute babies. Vote for me and show the Demoncraps whose boss 😎

t2o50a,"It's sad but the sanctions and ukrainian resolve has put putin in a very weird self inflicted do or die situation. 

If he loses : russia is still fucked. nato becomes stronger. Putin will lose all his support from the wealthy, the russian locality, the russian chiefs/governing officers. Economically, russia has been pretty much ass raped with the swift sanctions - russian businesses are going to be crippled, any relevant imports cut off and so on and so forth. 

If he wins : russia is still fucked but putin at least has some negotiating power occupying a nato adjacent country. putin will need a lot of damage control, but he'll eventually regain trust that he's lost over the past two days. 

Either ways, the sanctions are probably not going to last since russia is an important global socio-economic hub from multiple viewpoints. 

There is little chance any russian operating at the military level is going to back off now, if anything, putin will do all he can, short of using nukes obviously, to win this war - too much rides on it for him and his supporters and russians in general. This probably means the war has just begun - no matter who ends up winning (even if russia ""wins"", I don't exactly know what more they win than an enemy state that they need to spend exuberant resources to control and to purge opposing voices because of the titanium balls on ukrainians) ukraine will see casualty and destruction - a lot of it - in the coming days. It's heartbreaking how this war could have been avoided and how after it began, the sanctions, despite being well intentioned and a sane ""middle ground"" choice to corner russia, will probably spell massive ukrainian devastation - this devastation was probably always impending, since either ways ukrainians seem to be hell bent to also win or die, at least the sanctions will make russia bleed more. 

On a side note : if russians were previously against this war, some will now be for it and will want russia to desperately win. when someone tries to buy food in russia and their credit card doesn't work, they can curse putin and some will - however, it is much more natural to curse a country that they don't belong to - ukraine. they won't see the death in ukraine but their inconveniences, and that'll make a section a russians believe that winning this war is utterly imperative. 

If, somehow, ukraine holds its grounds far, far longer - we could possibly have a world war at our hands. I doubt putin would use nukes - not just doubt, i know he won't - it's too risky - but even without that, a long enough war between russia and ukraine will probably lead to some irrational decision making down the line that might make world war a highly likely scenario. 

russia is a relevant exporter and world needs their goods - realistically. aside from fleeting emotions, russian sanctions won't/can't last long without simultaneously bleeding multiple other relevant economy sectors worldwide. 

i hope something completely fucked up doesn't happen - this historically seems very identical to both world wars.

I never advocated for conversion therapy, I said what if someone is unhappy with their sexuality and would like assistance in transition.

In your apples to orange comparison, you brought up faith. This happens often as people transition from one faith to another, are we to assume all people who transition were bullied out of their faith?

This is a form of bullying when you get on the Internet and decide someone can’t say something- this is what you extreme folks don’t understand.

You want a society without malicious intent, then stop being malicious. Allow someone to say what they are going to say, confront it appropriately and you’ll probably reach an accord. Try to silence it and all you will do is give it power as is evidenced by 2016. 

The sad part you don’t realize is you’re not even trying to have a conversation, instead you are just preaching at me which immediately blocks any form of discord- meaning I won’t listen to you and you I... utterly meaningless. 

My advice, if your passionate enough to advocate- learn to engage those who disagree with you and have a conversation. The only way your message spreads is through diplomacy, I’m sure that is reasonable enough for a scientific mind to grasp 🤔",2020-05-08 20:39:37

czgx5l," On 04-09-2019, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam has officially announced the withdrawal of the Extradition Bill. Meanwhile, she rejected the 4 other demands from protestors in Hong Kong.   


Below are the 5 demands:  


1. Full withdrawal of the extradition bill

📷

2. A independent commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality

📷

From June to September, the Hong Kong Police has used excessive force against protestors (which include using the so call ‘less lethal’ weapons while not following the guidelines, carrying out unreasonable arrest, deliberately undermining the freedom of press, sexual harassment and physical abuse to arrested protestors, etc)   
Nevertheless, the current ‘Independent Police Complaints Council’ (IPCC) is not an effective department to investigate into police misbehaviour and it has been infamous for its lax enforcement of investigation. Thus, an Independent Commission of Inquiry is extremely necessary to save Hongkongers from this humanitarian crisis  


3. Withdraw the use of the word ‘riot’ in relation to protest

📷

4. The release of protestors and drop the charges against them

📷

5. The implementation of ‘genuine universal suffrage’

(This is stated in the Basic Law of Hong Kong. Currently, Hong Kong us under an absurd political environment where the Chief Executive is only selected by a small group of 1200 people and the Legislative Council of Hong Kong adopts the Functional Constituency which has introduced many pro-China councillors into the Council)

I also have friends from Siberia and they’re absolutely awesome. Then again, they immigrated over 30 years ago and both work for the US government now so— it’s kinda clear where their support rests.

I think this is unlikely, but Putin has shown himself to be radically dangerous and foolhardy in this war, so I *really* hope he isn't suicidaly stupid as well.

- That said, NZ is still doing better than say Mississippi (pop <3M), 1650 cases in NZ vs >70K cases in Ole Miss🤦‍♂️, so I wish they would compare NZ to individual states that would really drive the point home! It might even make it easier for people to see the comparison
- Even by pop density, Oregon and NZ are comparable...cases? (>20K vs 1650 cases...🤦‍♂️)
- We really did such a pisspoor job because of the lack of federal leadership because I guarantee if the gov’t got on the ball early we could’ve done better...how much better is up for debate but if we saved even one more life than we did now I think that’s a good thing",2020-08-18 11:41:41

Step 4: no coronavirus!

8s2x77,"Mostly it's to do with the concept of 'checks and balances'.

Essentially the crown denies power as opposed to exerting it, by denying any particular political bloc absolute control over the political system (by either rejecting acts or dissolving government).This is important as it means no political bloc can have absolute control over the government so long as the crown is around.

This creates (ideally) a political culture where attempting absolute political control is not only frowned upon but incredibly difficult. The merits of which should be obvious since this is reddit after all 😏

Lastly the crown can dissolve the government forcing an election. But not necessarily create their own government. Long story short; it's very hard to form a tyrannical government in a constitutional monarchy.

Sniffing isn’t proof of anything (a good portion of it has been debunked and cleared up a while ago), and all the groping videos are just clips of Biden positioning kids in front of cameras during photo shoots.

The right will edit any video to make someone look bad, no matter how badly they do it.

Edit: For those chiming in, with various points of view, many of which are very valid points. 

Re: The road through the pyramids site, which is a world heritage site, that is to be managed appropriately & preserved. 

I never said roads or even building up better infrastructure was a bad idea, I totally agree with building infrastructure that is of good quality, it’s a countries deserved right to move into a better way of life, for all its people, especially where things have been so hard, all countries whether big or small, rich or poor deserve this. 

That was not my point & when I mentioned *greed* what I meant was the sheer oversight in these important matters like preserving would heritage sites on a global scale not just in Egypt, but worldwide. 

These changes & decisions made by planning teams can at times be easily overshadowed by bad judgement & poor decision making by companies or governmental bodies that may have an outcome in mind that is not always the best outcome possible. 

It’s been evident that at times where there is public pressure or pressure from wealthy companies that this fundamental stand point has been lost to rhetoric & these sacred historical sites have been lost! 

I have seen this occur to some important sites already. I am just worried for what could become of such a special place, which is a one of a kind. The pyramids & megalithic structures found all over our earth, are from a bygone era that we do not fully comprehend. So if they are lost by human error, we may only have ourselves to blame, for lack of forethought & suitable custodian management. 

Yes human greed has destroyed one than one precious site on more than one occasion, so to be wary is paramount. 

That being said with careful planning & detailed precision when archiving the past, we can indeed more into the future. Even if necessary, overlaying on top of the old, is laid a new way, a new day, a new dawn.

bdlby1,"Read my words for an important life lesson: Such a sad thing. I absolutely love history. There is so much history in the Norte Dame Cathedral. It also survived some crusades, the French Revolution, WWI, and WWII. To see it up in flames over such a small thing, I just have no words for it. 

The fire and destruction makes me think about what the people in ancient times felt as they saw Solomon’s Temple on fire and being destroyed. There was a lot of history in that building as well. I can imagine we are feeling some of the things that they did. Especially all the Catholics in the world. While there are no words, one of the very first things that came to my mind after hearing the news, is Jesus Christ telling the Jews about how the temple will be destroyed, but will rise again in three days. He was of course talking about himself. 

How grateful I am that the Church is built on the Rock of Christ, and not an actual building. The gates of Hell cannot prevail against it. This fire is yet another reminder to me about how important it is to build our faith on Christ himself, and not on an object or place. Objects and things are fleeting in this life. We can not take those things with us to the next. But because of Christ, when our own bodies turn to nothing but dust or ash, it’s not the end. We will rise anew as well. For that I am beyond thankful to our Father in Heaven and Savior Jesus Christ. What a sacrifice He made for us.

With a slight variation to the final words of Joan of Arc, I say “Hold Christ high, that I may see Him through the flames.""💙",2019-04-16 03:33:49

Everyone is looks at this and is like “oh, WHO? Oh no.” If you disagree with China’s politics and government then you should agree with me on this. Because most people are uninformed upon the situation between the WHO, China, and Taiwan. Here is a video I suggest everyone looks at. The WHO also states that Covid-19 could not be transmitted through human to human contact and claimed there is no evidence proving of such a thing. Which we know to be absurd and completely incorrect. Taiwan is not a member of the World Health Organization, not by choice, but because the WHO won’t let them. Taiwan has done an incredible job in containing the spread of Covid-19 yet the WHO refuse to acknowledge this. They continue to push the idea that China has done a great job.

I’m assuming most of you do not know the history of Taiwan and China. So here you go (not that long of a read) 

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538

I refuse to support an organization bowing down to communist China’s rules and ideology. Now the CDC on the other hand has not. Only about 1/4 of you have actually read all the way down here and I appreciate it. I really do recommend doing some research before jumping onto the bandwagon. It’s our duty to be informed politically when making decisions on our future. And major news sources (such as Fox, CNN, BBC etc) should not be you’re only intake on the information. Especially if it is only 1 of those.

No excitement, nor sarcasm either. It's just news that are read, like a receipe for an 5000 year old cake that literally everybody knows...

As for the population, we start to hate America and we sort out to find new friends. Preferred European partners to work closer with. And we respect Canada a lot. They are reasonable people in the northern American continent that is closer to us. We also condemn Russia and China.

It's a miracle how the ""Land Of The Free"" is on the same step as Russia, China and North Korea.

It's a shame. And I feel deeply for the more educated US-American population.

I went to a sporting store and started looking at pants. Found some I liked, figured I'd be an M, or and S, since they didn't do waist sizes like jeans. 

Tried M, too big for my waist. Tried S, too big for my waist.  Asked the saleslady about this. She goes ""oh, lemme go get you something"" and comes back with one that was numbered. Number 28. ""Yay,"" I think, ""they do numbered ones!""

Buy it because it finally fits.

Heres the two sides of the conflict:

- Hamas (Palestine) intentionally firing missiles from civilian buildings into Israeli civilians.

- Israel bending over backwards to make sure the least amount of civilians get hurt.

So you support terrorist organizations attempting genocide?

Good on you!

(& before you talk about them controlling invasive species etc.. WE are the ones who kill their natural predators to protect the animals we farm for their flesh. if we didn’t farm animals we wouldn’t need to kill the native predators, therefore there wouldn’t be an issue with invasive species because we never would have upset the natural balance in the first place.)

Facebook isn't important. We don't need it. There are people who would die without antibiotics. Electricity literally formed the modern world. Women's suffrage has brought rights to women that were treated like property for all of time before that. Facebook is an app developed by a sociopath designed to sell your data to whoever pays the most. One of those things is not like the others.

I tried this. I cut out everything I deemed to be negative influences to my life—including social media (and Reddit).

But I think what people really need is to have a constant support of trusted friends, and to shape a life perspective that’s realistic, sensible, unbiased.

We will continue to see negativity, stupidity, etc. Billboards and advertisements are essentially life-sized  “click-baits” right?

I am learning to filter out much of the passion when seeing contents on social media, news, etc.

And you can too.

But lest you forget: we all contributed to this mess of clickbait culture. We are a part of it. And it starts with us to change ourselves.

Don’t be fed information. 

Learn to pick and choose. 

Find a balanced diet of information. Balance outrage with whatever else that tips your emotional/mental scale ⚖️

noh0xe,"He is currently standing trial, that part isn't changed at all. Pretty sure the legal consensus was that even if he were the serving PM when he's convicted, he would be forced to step down and serve his sentence by the supreme court.

What does change is we get a coalition that isn't the ""do anything and everything to keep bibi in power"", including giving the Haredi institutions copious amounts of money, terrorising the different government offices, and of course start a war because his opposition is forming a government.

Having a (possibly short-lived) government that doesn't include Itamar Ben-Gvir, a Kahanist who is... frankly a horrifying person is a nice plus.

The left should manage to balance out Bennett and Saar quite well as their actual electoral results were quite unimpressive this (fourth) election, so I'm honestly not that worried about that part.

Why an already advanced military base needs nearly 4 BILLION DOLLARS (A YEAR!!!!!) to fund their attacks on another group of people, which has no real government, leave alone ARMY, is beyond me...

Imagine 4 billion dollars being allocated toward universal American healthcare instead– it would effectively bring down the number of Americans who are seriously ill, seeking little to no treatment, as well as ensuring even better mental health down the road because hospital bills aren’t absolutely bankrupting people (many statistics can prove that citizens of countries with universal basic healthcare fare far better in terms of mental health in the long term than those without). 

Imagine 4 billion dollars being used for schools (there was literally an article stating schools in the US are underfunded by about $150 billion ANNUALLY). 

Imagine 4 billion dollars, in this instance, to fund the IRS... Or even allotted towards the extreme levels of poverty being experienced during/“after” the pandemic by those who were already near the cusp of it prior. 💔

But I guess a country that went to such great lengths to murder its own citizens in attempts to control the narrative on how poisonous alcohol is (but in reality to deter its bootlegging because if the US government doesn’t benefit from something, it’s “dangerous”), cannot be expected to be capable of properly allocating funds to sectors & services which truly require them.",2021-05-18 19:03:43

But the only difference is that we actually deliver the kid and abort the POS carrying it. 

There are plenty of birth control options for both males and females. And if not used properly then sterilization is the next requirement. Gotta get this shit under control.

There’s no logic in saying “people who don’t get vaccinated are a big threat to people who are vaccinated. So get vaccinated ✌🏾😃”.

https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21215588/google-chat-hangouts-meet-g-suite-name-change-rebranding

I felt like I had a stroke trying to make sense of this.

>Google has officially removed the Hangouts brand from its enterprise G Suite offering with the rebranding of Hangouts Chat as Google Chat

So Hangouts is now Google Chat, for some users.

>This latest modification was first hinted at by an updated G Suite support document listing the Google Chat name alongside Google Meet. Of course, this version of Chat is not to be confused with the other version of Chat, the name Google inexplicably gave its relatively new RCS-based Android messaging protocol.

But Google Chat shouldn’t be confused with Chat by Google...

>For now, Hangouts for G Suite — this is the workplace version of just the chat app — will continue to exist after Google postponed its discontinuation back in August of last year. In its place is now Google Chat, once Hangouts Chat, which is more of a Slack competitor for more robust workplace productivity and messaging than it is a straightforward, one-to-one messaging app like the Gchat of old. And for everyone else, your web Gmail account and iOS or Android device can still access the original, consumer version of Hangouts for the foreseeable future.

And the original hangouts was already announced to be discontinued, but will stay, for now, for some users, for some amount of time. 🤷‍♀️",2020-04-11 23:30:52

Some stats [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262961/countries-with-the-most-prisoners/) showing that Turkey is second the US in per capita incarceration, and [here is](https://www.prisonstudies.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/world_female_prison_4th_edn_v4_web.pdf) the stats on female prisoners which indicates China as second in this metric.

Shout out to all the Americans down voting, because obviously taking a moment to reflect on something unfavorable offends your delicate sensitivity and commitment to a national mythology of superiority. 😂

In case anyone wants more data on US stats:

634/100,000 pop. US incarceration is the highest in the world, broken down as follows:

2 094 000 (total)
at 2018 (U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics - 738,400 in local jails at 30.6.2018, 1,176,400 in state prisons, 179,200 federal prisoners. In addition, there are prisoners in the 80 Indian Country Jails (2,540 at mid-year 2016) and the 1,852 juvenile facilities (50,821 at 2014).)",2021-05-29 14:31:40

For example, here's a 2019 systematic review from BMJ on spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for low back pain. (Also just wanted to make a point of saying, SMT isn't all that chiropractors do.)  https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l689

>The bill change simply makes everyone a protected class

Lmao, OK we're done here, have a good afternoon.

Edit: To put this C-16 criminalization shitshow to rest I'm going to unequivocally cite experts in whether it does so:

>""I fear they will not be able to even discuss public policy issues such as this one, on which they may disagree with the government agenda,"" he said. ""Any law that limits legitimate discussion and debate of closely held beliefs presents a danger to freedom of expression, a fundamental value held dear by people across the political spectrum. The right to disagree must be viewed as sacred in our society.""  
>  
>But the bill doesn't do what the two men are arguing it does.  
>  
>Bill C-16 adds the words ""gender identity or expression"" to a list of protected classes under the Canadian Human Rights Act and to the Criminal Code.  
>  
>The Human Rights Act protects certain groups, prone to discrimination, from being **fired**, **evicted**, or otherwise **discriminated** against in federally-regulated workplaces, **housing projects**, or through **Ottawa-run services**.

&#x200B;

>Bill C-16, currently before Canada's parliament, prohibits discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act on the basis of gender identity and expression. The bill covers the federal government and federally regulated industries like banks or airlines. It also extends hate speech provisions under Canada's criminal code to transgendered people.  
>  
>""I don't think any legal expert would say using an inappropriate pronoun, while not something that respects the human rights of trans people, would ever result in a criminal conviction,"" said Kyle Kirkup, a law professor with the University of Ottawa who specialises in gender identity and sexuality law.

What you would be subject to however, if you engage in repeated harassment of your employees, whether it be through 'pronouns' or yelling at them because their eyes match the colour of your ex, is, drumroll, workplace harassment laws! These predate bill C-16 by a few several DECADES.

Here's an excerpt from before the law was passed.

>**current** provincial **workplace harassment** laws conceivably protect all people – whether transgender or not – from being repeatedly referred to with the wrong pronoun, **as this can create a toxic work environment**

And the same goes for yelling at an employee because their eyes match the colour of your ex. Their is no fucking pronoun law, and certainly not through C-16 as mentioned in the aforementioned excerpt, just workplace harassment laws. Which predate C-16 and apply to ALL actions on part of a person with power to create a toxic work environment on accounts of sex, ethnic, and religious characteristics, this has in fact unceremoniously been the case with US regulators for a while.",2019-12-17 01:49:09

It’s a shame we don’t live in a democracy, where we have a voice and a choice about what we do w our bodies

The “powers that be” (be selfish, greedy, apathetic) have been losing the “war” since day 1 losing too many souls because of their piss-poor strategy. 

It’s now time for a new tactic.
One that could be a huge success, could save countless lives
Inc the lives of those of us deprived of the medicines needed to get out of bed ea day and try to have a semi-normal life. 

But whatever will Big Pharma do!? Or the politicians who live inside the pockets of the CEOs...not to mention the crooks in the insurance racket; they will do everything in their power to NOT let it happen. Which is just ludicrous bcuz our nat debt would diminish in less than a year from the taxable income! Plus all of the jobs that would be created....
It’s a win win win 
Except for terrorists, the cartel and the like

We have to ask permission for just about everything and it’s absolutely infuriating sometimes.,2021-03-16 18:17:37

Two, you don’t even understand how Q spread but you think you’re the more knowledgeable person on this topic. You said it’s not like Q because there isn’t a central “Q”. The fact of the matter is that Qanon spreads through people who are not Q, they don’t need the main actor. It’s ok to not understand.

Edit: I do like that I’m so under your skin that you went back through my stuff this long after. Really struck a nerve.

Edit two: for one to say I’m insulting others, I wouldn’t expect you to be the culprit, you should go through your own history.

Edit three: checked your posts one more time. Within your first three comments I saw the insult of “illiterate”. Lmfao, please think of a new word. Do you just wake up and think, “Oh boy! Time to get on Reddit and call people illiterate!” 😂😂",2021-03-22 04:34:30

9q4fy8,"Ok so I was born in 1978. I'm 40yrs old. Seems like everyone is blaming my generation for the condition of the Earth today. 
  Growing up in the 80's and 90's all I remember hearing is how everyone's parents is destroying the Earth's ozone layer, landfills overflowing, plastic can rings, paper and plastic bags (too many), areosol cans (hairspray), styrofoam containers from fast food joints ect. 
As kids and teenagers in the 80's and 90's saving the Earth became our top priority. 
Because of MY generation we now have reusable bags made of durable cloth and plastic. Our use of styrofoam containers have decreased enormously. We have recycling stations at the dump, in our schools and restaurants. We have more organic foods than I have ever seen. Solar and wind energy. Growing our own gardens. Natural gas. We even tried biofuel by reusing cooking oil from fast food chains ( have you ever smelled the exhaust from those cars? Horrible). The way we get paid and the way we pay for things are nearly all paperless. 
I can go on and on about this. We paved the way for your generation to improve on what MY generation started 30+ yrs ago. 

So QUIT BLAMING us and you're welcome. 😊",2018-10-21 23:54:35

That’s all that is wrong. Human beings are incredible things and because we want to express that and can’t....We go POP!

People want significance. Matter. We are SO different to anything else ANYWHERE we can see. With no instructions. 

We have instructions now.

What I was talking about was the AUMF in 2001 passed by Congress just days after 9/11.  It's the authorization to use military force by Congress for the POTUS, Bush at the time, and is still in effect today. That document is the one allowing all the military actions you mentioned in your comment. 

The military industrial complex you mentioned are the political influences that keep more civilized politicians like Barbara Lee from California from passing a new AUMF with an end date. She has introduced the bill in her H.R. committee every year since and gotten support,  but it never makes it to the floor for a vote. 

My point is that BHO didn't start anything without congressional approval,  nor did Bush or the current administration. While the POTUS gives the order, Congress gives (gave) permission and writes the check. That hasn't changed.

People should know. 

The so called Google doc had - 

1. a plan of action to cause physical disturbance across Indian embassies in the world / cause physical disturbances within india
2. A plan to change Indias ""Chai and yoga"" image!! - what's that got to do with the farmers protest?
3. Had links to promote accounts run by khalistani separatists (go figure yourself) 


And icing on the cake.. For all this climate activist nonsense, one of the key demands of the protesting ""farmers"" is that they should not be penalised for stubble burning.. The same stubble burning that converts Delhi into a gas chamber for months every year..  And so called climate activists are supporting this. This demand by the way has already been agreed by the govt 🤦🏽‍♂️ - now that's something I want to protest over.

The reality is, these protests are not about about farmers.. These are about securing the  middlemen who currently hold power over farmers.. Because the current system creates a monopolistic environment where farmers can sell only and only at their designated markets and at the price which has been set by these middlemen (only 2% of all  purchase happens at Msp). The new laws change this. The new laws give farmers an option to sell anywhere in the country and at whichever price they want with the option of selling at the MSP or the minimum support price at the designated market if rates at other markets are not good. How is that not OK? 

India wastes tonnes and tonnes of raw food every year because govt does not have the storage capacity. These laws allow private companies to setup storage facilities  - how is that a bad thing!? 

Can someone explain. Which other country has so many restrictions on doing business for a sector as India. How is changing this situation bad?",2021-02-15 12:33:35

Check out Dr Jenson, and his outing of this covid agenda, he has put his reputation and career on the line, so he must have reason for doing so 
Not only that, what about all the Doctots and nurses who have now been coming out and  exposing what has been going on on the front line, New york?
The female Doctor, who won a Nobke piece prize for her groundbreaking work with Hiv, back in the day. She knows mire than me and you put it that way! And she has risked all to make the public aware of what is going on, on the back of this floored covid viris!
One Doctor has put up $5000 of his own money to anyone who can prove under proper scientific terms that it exists! No takers as yet?? They don't publish all this News thought do they? Just a one sided narrative that if you don't question and ask for evidenc; your a conspircey theorist!!! 
What i have heard explaind by dr rashid, Jenson and many other specialists in the field of virology, compared to the non-evidencial ramblings of puppet politians, who have no medical background what so ever, nor can they back up or prove their claims! We must just take them at there word, because they really do care for the massers! Ha! Come on! Dr felthcey and Dr bill gates, oh no sorry, he has no medical back ground either!

I think it’s because it has some thicker cotton around the nose wire that helps defuse the air better.

ikg009,"He got his own ways. That’s also why he became Mayor of town.

People hate him, because he is a dick.

But people love him, because he is a dick.

EDIT: To get idea, why is he hated and loved at same time.

His town had issues with abandoned cars, well laws are short on this issue, because there is so many loopholes. So he sent letter to owners which in short said “either you get rid of that car in week, or someone else will”

Well next week car was still there, he said ok I gave you warning and you didn’t care.

And “nobody knows how”, next day car wasn’t there. Problem solved. 😁

Of course if the owner decides to sue him, it will be long one, but he couldn’t care less, because people will stand behind him firmly.


EDIT2: I fucked up the story, its how r/Vivillon666 says:

ae20cn,"Your perception is clearly not aligned with reality.  The British were NOT comparable to the Nazis.  I never indicated that everything they or the allies did was defensible (especially when it comes to the Soviets).

I glanced at the rest of your statements but as soon as I read ""They are the same"" I knew you were not credible.  The country that blunted the Luftwaffe's momentum and fought back the campaign of indiscriminate bombing of civilian centers by the Nazis (At least until the V1 and V2) is clearly not the same as Nazi Germany, who had a state run system of oppression that eventually resulted in the  murdere of millions and millions, the Nazis who violated international treaties, the Nazis  who initiated a truly global war, the Nazis who enslaved and murdered millions of POWs, the Nazis who placed sirens on their Stuka dive bombers specifically to strike terror into the hearts of whoever they were attacking, civilian and soldier alike, the Nazis who were found guilty of war crimes after they were defeated.  

You'd have to be an idiot and would have to ignore the true facts and evidence of how truly evil the Nazis were, to say that the enemy of the Nazis are their identical counterpart.

By such a shallow assertion you could argue that if you swapped out Hitler's Reichstag for Chamberlain's Parliament (You could argue that Churchill never would have become prime minister had it not been for Nazi aggression), that the British would have then went and oppressed and eventually tried to exterminate the Jews.  After all, in your own words, ""they are the same"".  Despite fire bombing later in the war, one would have to be an utter fool to truly believe there is no difference between the British and the Nazis.

You can try to refute this, but you said yourself the British and the Nazis are one in the same, which history has clearly shown is not accurate.  You don't get to be selective when you say they are identical.

Now the way Britain exploited ""uncivilized"" peoples in the 18th and 19th centuries is another story and I see you mentioned that in one of your attempts at a rebuttal.  However, imperial Britain of earlier centuries and Britain in the mid 20th century were two very different animals.  WWII helped lead Britain away from colonialism, however this only accelerated the decolonization attitude in Britain that existed since WWI.  You trying to compare imperial Britain with mechanized Nazi Germany is just plain laughable and any rational person can see it's trying to compare apples and oranges.  The Britain you compared Nazi Germany to in your rebuttal did not even have an air Force yet because it was before planes were invented!  The Britain you equivocate with Nazi Germany couldn't even bomb indiscriminately as flight was still far in the future.  Come on man, THINK!  Apples and Oranges. 

Thanks for playing, try giving it some true critical thought next time.  🤘✌️ ",2019-01-24 02:08:33
ae20cn,"Just another comment on this one, The Nazis were not murdering civilians in order to bring an end to the war.  Rather, the war provided public distraction and the territory required to initiate a campaign of genocide.

You just tried to imply that Nazis were only murdering Jews to bring and end to the war.  

I encourage you to reread whatever you're about to post both before and after you post it, somethings that escaped your feeble mind on the first go around may become apparent in a second review, such as this.  Your statements imply assertions ( such as the one just described) that you just plain miss or don't realize what you're actually saying.  

I don't know what level of education you have attained, but you REALLY need to improve your ability to make a clear argument without putting your foot in your mouth.  Same goes for your comprehension skills because you clearly did not register a word I said.

This is such bullshit, IDK why people upvote you.

 You have to be an idiot to believe that destruction of ussr was painless, this event by itself brought oligarchy and banditism into all post-soviet countries and created conflicts around world.

90th are literally worst times in modern history for post-soviet population. People were thrown out of republics for ""wrong nation"", driven away from their homes and families, property was taken from them by your good old ""you'd rather die? "" bandits. Laughing at Zimbabwian billions of dollars? That's what you had to live through 3 times in 90th, everything you had was gone if you stored it in currency. People left without money were giving up property, businesses for dimes.

America will do nothing. And unlike when the Germans took Poland. Neither will Europe. But the people of Europe will shit bricks. 

Russia takes Ukraine and everyone runs around like a chicken with its head cut off screaming what do we do. American and European politicians say they are working on a diplomatic solution which is code for: ""but we're scared of them"". 

One thing just the threats will do.. effect American political mind set. See Biden does not project strength. He projects confusion. Weakness. 

The prior president projected strength. Which why in 2015 the left said we where on the verge of war with North Korea. Well. The prior president saw to that didn't he. 

But racism... sure bud.. sure. You keep on keeping on. Nothing prevents war. Like strength.

The head of WHO is a communist—a member of a violent “liberation” party in Ethiopia. As minister of foreign affairs, he covered up cholera outbreaks. The CCP poured millions into his campaign for director general, which is why WHO repeats Chinese talking points. 


He tapped the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, also a violent, corrupt communist, to be Goodwill Ambassador as a campaign favor. Tedros’s leadership is characterized by corruption. And, honestly, we should never have anything to do with organizations led by communists.

They didnt say it couldnt spread via contact but that there was no clear evidence. Basically china reported that every confirmed case up to that point was reportedly from workers and visitors to the wet market and no healthcare workers had gotten sick yet.

While the first case can be traced to november 17th it would be insane to say they should have known then that this was a problem given the symptoms overlap with so many existing diseases. It wasnt even until december 20th that there were 60 confirmed cases. 

With hindsight we can say the response wasnt great but do you know how to manage a brand new disease that may or may not turn out to be a pandemic? Do you know what the capabilities are of the WHO to respond and get physical access to the infected?",2020-04-15 15:28:46

o5x1pw,"Hopefully this encourages change. Not only are their working hours over the top, they have extremely hierarchical structures which means making decisions is painful. They are also hyper detail oriented, to the point where it doesn’t even make sense.

I wanted to share my experience as an American IT contractor in Japan. I was installing servers in remote locations and running tests alongside the Japanese customer. The entire time a QA person followed me around and was looking over my shoulder at every movement. If I stepped away from a computer for even a minute, he’d take it upon himself to sit in my chair and examine what I had been doing. When he wasn’t doing that he was comparing the software manual to our delivered software and identifying every typo or slight discrepancy he could find. At the end of already long days he’d slowly lost out all the things he had found (if any) delaying us from leaving the site. Then he’d call his boss and ask if it was okay for us all to leave the site. That boss would sometimes have questions further delaying us going home.

During one install the provided server mounts did not fit a rack. This happens, it’s just a matter of ordering a new set that fits. It was like the world had come to an end. We had multiple meetings about how to resolve the issue with all different types of their management getting involved. One of their poor engineers played with the mounts for an entire day trying to get them to fit. At the end of the day I found him fast asleep with his head on the mount.

Another time, one step of a software upgrade did not go to plan and I needed to do something that was not in the manual. They threatened to require me to fly home and test it in factory before allowing me to try it on their servers. I was asked how this could have happened and why we were not prepared. I eventually talked them down, but it was so much unnecessary stress.

Literally the opposite of what they did.

Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa Shogunate during this period of isolation, an inefficient and disunited system of feudal lords. By undergoing reform & opening up Japan became a modern, constitutional monarchy with (varying degrees of) representative democracy",2020-03-14 22:32:02

er5sc8,"Posting here for visibility:

Wealth inequality is so much worse than most people realize, our current economic system is very broken and there's plenty of information that proves it. So, where to start?

[The ultra-rich have as much as $32 trillion hidden away in offshore accounts to avoid taxes.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth-idUSBRE86L03U20120722) As a way to understand the magnitude of the number 32 trillion (32,000,000,000,000) let's use time as an example. One million seconds is only 12 days, but one billion seconds is 31 years. So there's a massive difference between a million and a billion, much more than people realize. But how much is 32 trillion seconds? It's over a million years.

People know it's an issue but they don't understand just how extreme it can be. Here's an example: **If you had a job that paid you $2,000 an hour, and you worked full time (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much wealth as Jeff Bezos.** And yes [his wealth isn't all in cash, but he wouldn't want it to be.](https://np.reddit.com/r/MobilizedMinds/comments/dn8xdp/but_their_money_isnt_all_in_liquid_assets/)

I've been researching this issue for years because I was shocked at just how bad it really is. I've come to the conclusion that there are underlying flaws in the system, and I've put together some information to help illustrate it.

>**“No business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By workers I mean all workers, and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level, I mean the wages of decent living.""** - Franklin Delano Roosevelt speaking about the minimum wage (it was always meant to be a living wage)

°

>**""The cause of poverty is not that we're unable to satisfy the needs of the poor, it's that we're unable to satisfy the greed of the rich.""** - Anonymous

°

>**""Anyone who believes in indefinite growth on a physically finite planet is either a lunatic or an economist.""** - Kenneth Boulding

°

>**""A century ago scarcity had to be endured; now it must be enforced.""** - Murray Bookchin

°

>**""Capitalism as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of evils. I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion.""** - Albert Einstein

°

>**""If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.""** - Stephen Hawking

**So, what do we do?**

I think the first step is spreading awareness and organizing people. Joining or creating local organizations is always good, and [unionizing is a great thing as well,](https://i.postimg.cc/N06BZt33/12731.jpg) and there are organizations like the IWW that can help you do that.

But honestly I think one of the best things we can focus on is to get behind [the only candidate who has been talking about these issues for decades.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SYxZfksAyco) Although [the media is slandering him,](https://youtu.be/3ZhkKATtqtU) and [completely omitting him from their coverage,](https://imgur.com/a/VyNVA8D) he [actually has the most support,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/02/us/politics/2020-democratic-fundraising.html) and [especially amongst young people.](https://i.redd.it/ybarwig9v5u31.jpg)

The [other candidates](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/24/elizabeth-warren-not-progressive) just [don't stack up.](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/22/pete-buttigieg-just-shill-corporations-and-donor-class)

The public needs to get more involved in politics, and we need to demand that the system works for us, but I think it's important that we have a leader who actually cares about solving these problems because otherwise it's even more of an uphill battle. So register to vote as a democrat, vote for Bernie in the primaries, and get as many other people as you can to do the same. Subscribe to r/WayOfTheBern, r/OurPresident and r/SandersForPresident. And if you're willing and able to contribute money or time then please donate or volunteer for Bernie's campaign. An easy thing you can volunteer for is [phonebanking,](https://BernieSanders.com/call) where you contact people and give them information, or you can also [send texts](https://BernieSanders.com/text) which is even easier. 

We have some serious problems with our political and economic system. There are many things we can do to fix these problems, but the most important thing is to get the right person in the white house, and we have less than a month left until the first primaries. This is not a drill, please get this information out there as much as you can and make sure that people know about these issues and know how to fix them. Thank you for your support, together we can do this!

It's only amazing in the short-term, in an unsustainable way, for some elites and their corporations. And that's only because they're not wise enough to understand that there are better systems for *everyone*, as an alternative. 

Better... even for them.)

...

We ought to manage our own country accordingly to our values. 

Produce what we need. Store or sell the excess through trade deals. Buy, through them, what little we don't have.

Why are there conflicting messages out of the WHO?",2020-04-16 03:31:58
g1zuzn,"Hi this post is for the people of panet earth who are scared rn and sick and tired of confusing click bait disguised as ""news"" 

Pointing fingers about who said what and then being outraged about the stupidity of ppl is... STUPID

Mainstream media (MSM) show anecdotal cases of that doctor who died of covid and look at how sad the family is and what a hero and omg anyone who gets covid19 will die a painful death and hundred of thousands have died - without giving statistical context - THIS IS NOT NEWS IT IS THE CREATION OF A NARRATIVE. 

This is a carefully constructed narrative designed to impact ur base human emotions and create fear thru a tragic and scary and sad story and Fear is the currency of control. 

So. I got tired of being scared af and I decided to pull real data (cia website, and index mundi) from various sources and use my own judgement. Here is what i learned (and coincidentally what is not readily promoted and covered by the MSM):

In 2018 about 60million ppl died on this planet
Of that 8 million died from respiratory illnesses

I do not know if close to 300,000 deaths in the span of 5 months is significant. I am not a doctor or infections specialist. 

In mid-March The british government (on their website) stated that covid19 was no longer considered a HCID (high consequence infectious disease). Shortly after that they imposed strict lock down measures on the whole country. 

The only formal way u can determine cause of death is by performing an autopsy. They are worried about post mortem spread of covid19 and are not allowing autopsies to be performed. 

The US surgeon General in mid april announced that the us would no longer be adhering to WHO protocol for how to deal with covid19 and instead would be looking at the data they have been collecting to make decisions going forward (this waa not covered by ANY MSM - i heard about it and then found the interview on fkng SoundCloud) - search for it (not on google try duckduckgo n u should b able to find it) 

Sweden did not impliment strict lockdown policies - they are not doing relatively worse or better than most nations in terms of deaths and number of cases.

Lastly, a quarantine is when u seclude the sick and the weak.. This is not a quarantine it is mass house arrest leading to economic ruin mainly for the most vulnerable people on our planet (interesting fact - the populations that will be most impacted economically by covid are those working in sectors that were expected to lose jobs in the near futuree due to automation) 

I can go on and on and on... Main point is if u think that magic box on ur wall is just there to inform you and show u the facts - u r not being critical enough about ur existence and reality of this planet. Someone is just spoonfeeding u what they want u to think and u are happily eating it without questioning why or digging deeper than just the 5oclock news

Question everything u r told. Do ur own research. Dont let fear be the reason u give up ur liberties.

Something to just ask urself:

Trillion dollar bailouts/ hyper inflation/ economic ruin vs immediate and effective testing to determine the real mortality rate and then create policies accordingly (don't know the cost but can guarantee it is significantly less than the first option) ..... So as a reasonable logical person i am sure u would chose the later option bc it makes a lot of sense right?? so why the fuck isnt our government doing that???

We have infinite $ to make sophisticated bombs n kill other humans but cannot roll out logical and adequate mass testing...  Why???

bdilj8,"In Paris right now, about a kilometre from Notre Dame. I can just hear sirens and helicopters endlessly. The smoke is covering the sky from the hotel balcony. Very surreal. Walked past it today and was lucky enough to have visited when I came to Paris last time. 

Hoping that there are no lives lost and that there aren't any tragic historical losses. The entirety of the Paris Fire Department must be on the site and with it believed to be from restoration work I'm hopeful that means there won't be too much of value right nearby.

Just so surreal, never been so close to something so massive. Big test for the French fire-fighters and potentially a big day in French history depending on what is lost.

Fingers crossed.

Edit: things look to be going from bad to worse. Spire has collapsed according to French news. The noise outside is only getting louder. I've had to just lock myself in my room, close the windows and just try to forget. This is just so tragic. So so tragic. To be here only makes it worse. It feels like it's on a magnitude usually reserved for terror attacks.

To my Parisian friends I've had the pleasure of interacting with over the last week, we all feel your pain. Keep safe and clear from the cathedral, move out of the way of emergency vehicles and all we can do is hope. ❤️ Paris",2019-04-15 17:44:20

I've seen it first hand with operations I was part of. CNN (who i trusted at the time) told a way off-the-wall story even though we asked them to not report anything yet, as it could sincerely jeopardize our location and safety, including the reporter that was with us (Freaking dumbass).  We didn't allow him to stay with us after that. He was putting all of our lives at risk for something that wasn't even worth talking about. He just needed something to ""print"".

kn2jje,"We have a family member who has tipped over the edge into the cult. Based on my experiences with him and attempted rational discussions with other rabid trumpers, these are the things I have learned:
1. Every fact is fake news, biased or somehow otherwise tainted.
2. All roads somehow lead back to Hillary Clinton and Barak Obama. Even after 4 years of trump.
3. Their meager 401k is the equivalent of a million gold bars, even if half of it went down the shitter.
4. Obama took too many vacations while in office but trump is so overworked and picked on that he requires a 3.5 million dollar golf outing every weekend to unwind.
5. Obama pardoned too many criminals (!) but trump only did what was “right” in pardoning too many criminals. 
6. Hillary Clintons emails. There seems to be no rationale for this statement. Apparently, that’s all I need to know.
7. trump has done “so much for ‘murica. When requesting a list I get the following: brought jobs back to ‘Murica (this is when I point out all the business’ that have closed, many of the jobs are p/t to avoid paying benefits, whole industries he promised towns he was going to save then didn’t etc.), he built a wall (😂😂) no comment, and he “Made America Great Again” which encompasses whatever fantasy about “we’re #1” that person is having on that day.
8. The Dems, libtards and snowflakes have spent the last 4 years “obstructing” trump’s efforts to lead. It’s always crickets when one points out that they had the first two years of both Congress and Senate as majorities but still failed to convert anything into action.
9. At this point, you have probably spent hours pulling up facts, statistics and more research than for an average university paper. You have footnoted in all the required styles, corrected the spelling and grammar and presented a clear, clean paper. Mainly because they have screamed at you (all in caps) to CITE YOUR SOURCES!!!! Of course, you are then labeled as an “idiot” because you went to college/university and are now apparently lording your intellect “over” that person. (It’s always a personal problem to them).
10. You have proved your points several times over by now. Their little tea kettle selves are steaming. At this stage, you are now being called “sheeple.”
11. This inevitably leads to assertions about freedom and the Constitution. All of these high school graduates and drop outs somehow have become Constitutional Law specialists over night. The interpretations are mind boggling at best, completely wrong at worst. I went to law school in real life but let me tell you, I have been proudly impressed by the number of people who actually went diving to find precedents, Supreme, Appeals and lower court decisions etc. to back their arguments. Kudos, bravo and well done!
12. When all else has failed to bring you around to their way of thinking: “I don’t care” is the response. Closely followed by you being called a Communist/Socialist neither ideology of which is understood by the trumper at all.

At this point, they are a lost cause. The delusion is so deep and the anger so complete, I don’t know if they can recover, ever.",2020-12-30 20:21:35

Notably, your inference is that the law bans protests about abortions. That’s NOT what the law is saying. Instead, it’s saying that protests about abortion can’t happen right in front of the clinic because there have been too many instances of harassment and inappropriate behavior. The protesters are free to go voice their opinion TONS of other places. Just not right in front of the abortion clinic.

Good for that person? For every 1 that says that there are a 100 who say otherwise 🤷‍♂️ + is every miscarriage a murder? A woman can be pregnant and miscarry and never even know she was pregnant, it happens all the time, what about invitro? A friend of mine just had to get an abortion because she had 18 eggs implant...18! Is she guilty of mass murder? The shit is way more complicated that ""trashy people getting convenience abortions"" there are dozens of reasons why a person doesn't want a baby, and there are dozens more why a person who does has to get an abortion....

>And if you don’t want the kids there’s always adoption there is currently a waiting list of over 3 million couples waiting to adopt babies. People wait for years to get a chance to adopt a baby

If you don't want a baby you can also terminate the pregnancy when you find out about it, the choice to carry a pregnancy to term is up to the individual, you arent asking a trivial thing of people to ask them to carry a pregnancy to term, there are a ton of health risks and financial costs to that, to say nothing of the trauma and stigma of giving up a baby for adoption.

Its up to the person, not up to religious crazies or the State to make that decision for a person, sorry, I will never be on board with that

If you are truly against abortion you should advocate for sex education for kids and easy/free access to contraception for anyone regardless of age that wants it....otherwise it really isn't about reducing the abortion rates imo, because those are the ONLY measures that have ever actually reduced abortions.",2021-08-13 01:36:13

Putin never stays in one place long enough. He’s paranoid about Covid. That’s the reason for the extremely long table when he was going to talk to Zalensky., you know?  Peace talks.-never.

I am lucky to work in tech and have good health insurance through my job but I saw what my husband had to go through to get any health care before we got married and got him on my insurance… it was so bad that his friends joke that while I am an immigrant he married me for health insurance instead of me marrying him for a green card 🤣 it’s the saddest but most accurate joke,2021-09-23 03:57:55

The risk is not big nobody forces you to go on vacation in a high risk region so you know what you get. If you have an medical exemption you still get quarantine payment.

I'm so very proud of my country for this.

We've also got Covid-19 under control, so there's that too. 😄

Edit: some replies are asking if the number of LGBTQIA+ people are qualified and if that number is truely representative of the population as a whole. 

We don't have a hard quota system so that number is not fixed, and [most of our MPs \(members of parliament\) are elected directly by each electorate](https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features/what-is-the-mmp-voting-system/), with a party list filling in any remaining seats to make up the percentage that a given party won in the party vote. It's up to the people of each electorate to decide how qualified their representative is. That many are LGBTQIA+ is a good sign that being queer is not a considered a black mark against them, as it shouldn't be.  Discrimination is a terrible thing.

As for their numbers v the percentage of the population as a whole- that's hard to say as we don't know how many people are still in the closet, or don't yet know themselves.",2020-11-06 07:17:57

f13x7o,"""Experts"" hey? That a **very** subjective term.
I can't imagine that any other president would be accused of that for the normal thing of hiring & firing staff.
And the Impeachment was always a Partisan & Subjective thing with a subjective standard of what is impeachable. Other Presidents don't do what Trump did? I thought it was almost US policy?

 Impeachment is a Partisan & Subjective process in the US Constitution, it is supposed to be.
Yet the Corporate Media I have seen totally left that out.
Or that it was inconceivable for it to get through the Senate from the word go.
From that Manipulative Media, I  don't expect anything else.


I'm not an American or a Trump fan, though I do prefer him to other options seeing as he has proven himself & done comparatively well if a fair measure is used in comparing Presidents.
In 2016 I voted for & donated to Bernie Sanders (yes, illegally, sorry Americans 😢. I got exited but that's no excuse. The Bernie team gave me a check but didn't end up giving the money back).",2020-02-09 06:52:27
f13x7o,"Firstly, I may be I'm wrong because I don't read up much on it because I don't expect the Media to tell the the truth she something is controversial and it takes a lot of my time.

I said it is Partisan & with a subjective criteria, because that's what I saw on an Infographics video on the Second Impeachment in the 1800's which examined the Impeachment process.
***Yes the media told me the opposite, which one do you think is less biased & attached to the outcome?***

The way I make up my mind is that I ask people with a different view then me, and to ask how they know it is true. I find it effective, but it can be harm to find people who have a humble attitude and also can back up what they say and give context and proportion. Still that takes time.

Most people I ask act the way you did in your response:
Your personal attacks; strong sense of your superiority & my inferiority; don't give a logic answer that is well informed AND has a sense of proportion & fairness (including to worst adversaries).

So you could have actually explained why you believe what you believe, how you know and what evidence or info your relying upon.
That's what I do WHEN I AM GENUINELY well informed (not this thing which looks like a circus).

But instead you raged and accused and races and belittled and Ahmad a tantrum.
***THEN YOU COMPLAIN*** about a President getting elected that you very much deserve.
Quite a few non-Partisan non-political YouTube Channels have done video on how that helped elect Trump massively.

All I can say is with your choice to bully & belittle anyone who disagrees with you and displays such immense arrogance (which is your choice) toward me simply for a different you.......is that ***you very much deserved President Trump 100%***

And I'm not even a Trump supporter ideologically.
And I agree quite a bit about his flaws or bad traits. I'm Australian too. I'm glad our politics isn't quite as toxic as ***you*** helped to make it.

f13x7o,"I'm basically saying he probably didn't say what you though he did with things like the ""Mexican comments"" in 2016 or the gross bleeding ones.
He says such things in such a way as people will get what they want to get from it.

Especially, most importantly he can Enrage the Control Freak Bullying types (then show his strength justifying at them); the people who aren't race obsessed see it as a comment on illegal immigrants (I think it was, but couldn't find the whole video last time I checked); and the small minority of people who actually feel Mexicans are inferior people can also read something into it.

If you don't like that that Trump does these things, have you considers that you may be part of the main enabler of it?

Go into any Trump supporter space and see how much they revell in the Outrage Tantrums & their loss of control over others (esp Media's).
I kinda feel the same way, being on the receiving end of such people's abuse & bullying when I'm trying to be nice and just politely make a point or answer something. Even worse was when it was things like doxing, platforming, harassment, Twitter mob shaming ""offenders"" or trying to destroy someone's employment.

Anyway, I have written too much.

Back in time we were the most tolerant country in Europe, sheltering people that couldn't be themselves in their countries. Today it is actually reversed and it saddens me.

-

In our country somehow it got connected to being a pedofile. So for many people it is straightforward: gay people abuse kids. It may be only the case for uneducated people, but still there are way too many people thinking like this. 

The church also portraits lgbt community as something evil. They publish pictures of people in pride parades, clothed as Jesus and doing ""obscene"" things. Or pictures of Mary (polish favourite) that are re-done with rainbow as an aureola etc. Polish Catholics do not like that and they are very sensitive to such things. Religious imagery is sacred to us (them) and it is not taken lightly when someone tampers with it. 

Another thing is that being gay is a sin. Acting upon it is a sin. If you happen to be gay, you need to abstain from acting upon it forever and live in celibacy forever. My own father spoke to me that it is a deadly sin or something. Deadly sin means it is not redeemable. So, Catholic agenda over and over. 

Young people which are mainly agnostics don't like for anybody to be different. Being succesful means you are straight, have a family and preferably your own house/flat and a car before 30. If you even get a facial piercing, you might be looked at wierdly. When you are gay it is somehow shameful, although noone knows the reason. The window for normalcy is so narrow it is just plain sad. We have looong way to go.

I would list more reasons but it gets too long and I feel suffocated thinking about it 😂",2020-07-30 20:25:57

Angels don't just sing at Christmastime. For most Americans, they're a year-round presence. A new Associated Press-GfK poll shows that 77 percent of adults believe these ethereal beings are real.

Belief is primarily tied to religion, with 88 percent of Christians, 95 percent of evangelical Christians and 94 percent of those who attend weekly religious services of any sort saying they believe in angels.

But belief in angels is fairly widespread even among the less religious. A majority of non-Christians think angels exist, as do more than 4 in 10 of those who never attend religious services.

Beyond the religious gap, women are more likely than men to believe angels are real, and those over 30 are more apt than younger adults to think they exist.

The finding mirrors a 2006 AP-AOL poll, which found 81 percent believed in angels.

Previous polling has found the public a bit more likely to believe in God, but far less likely to believe in other other-worldly beings. In May, 92 percent of adults told Gallup pollsters they believed in God. But just 34 percent in an AP-Ipsos poll in 2007 said they believed in ghosts or UFOs.

The AP-GfK Poll was conducted Dec. 8-12 and is based on interviews with 1,000 adults nationally. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

iggaow,"This is messed up. Like, I get it, your private school has a code of conduct that someone didn’t follow so now they have to go to the public school. Fine. But that doesn’t make it everybody’s freaking business. Are those same Administrators required to get up and anounce to the whole school every time they sin? Do they have teachers regularly stand up and say why they shouldn't have looked at that porn? No? Just her? 

Also, you said this happened to HER. Because, ya know, she got pregnant all by herself. I’m SURE that it wasn’t another student who got off without any recourse. 🙄



Edit: as a side note, just because I understand expelling when someone doesn't meet the code of conduct (when there are public options available) doesn't mean I agree with it.

Again, I will use my example: it’s not the government’s fault if someone decides to shoot themselves, but clearly it’s their fault if they then decide to prevent them from getting medical attention.

My boyfriend & I were trying to decide today whether we should order a filtered straw or more batteries. I said something about how, ""They probably have clean water by now, since supplies have started coming in... I mean, it's not like they're drinking out of puddles. ""

Fuck.

EDIT: Since a few people have already asked separately, I'll elaborate a little...

My boyfriend's aunt is like 75 years old, and all she does and has done for years is take care of everyone else. She's taken in a couple of teenage kids and is raising them, she feeds everyone, she goes broke sometimes trying to shelter & help everyone... 

Anyway, she's always been like a Saint, so we plan to just keep sending what we can, when we can until we hear otherwise. We know that she will distribute & share what she can if she doesn't have use for something, or has a surplus of anything.

So, with regard to using her address so that anyone that wants to avoid using a charity or organization, but wants to donate/contribute directly to the people would have the means to do so... I would definitely consider doing that. I'm not quite sure of the best way to go about doing something like that yet, but I'll figure it out easily enough!",2017-09-30 03:43:56

Ever where I go it's Trump flags, gatherings, intersection rallies and even convoys of vehicles sporting trump stuff. There have been boat parades for him too, which in my time I have never once heard of during an election.

His voter base sees him as their savior and the only standing in the way of anti-constitution lefties and naive socialists.
His opposition has nothing to offer but the fact that they aren't trump.

As a matter of fact I don't think ive seen Biden say anything but that he will give everyone free money.

What a bunch of clowns. 4 years later, 50 million dollars on a special counsel that couldn't find even one thing, a sham attempt at a coup to remove a daily elected president with the bullshit impeachment trials and now we're worried Trump won't concede. Meanwhile the democratic base, aka BLM, Antifa, and the rest of the libtards, are destroying cities through looting, burning, and violence over the death of known criminals. But hey, Orange man bad. 

4 years in office and record numbers across the board. It took a worldwide pandemic to slow it down. None of that matters though because you will vote for a corrupt career politician who hasn't done shit in 47 years. That's the modern day libtard logic (or lack of).

j6tvwr,"Vancouver plastic straw ban went into effect this spring 

but bubble tea specifically got a 1 year exemption 😂

dunno what the best solution should end up being since I rarely get takeout drinks that use straws....  but the biodegradable straw at A&W are terrible. feels like sucking on cardboard and if you take more than an hour to sip on your root beer, the straw gets soggy.

the sippy cups at Starbucks are pretty bad too.

at this point think I may just get some metal straws or whatever .... an ex used those and they were the only straws that still felt like decent straws.",2020-10-07 21:32:33

Edit: can you guys read what's after the question mark? Because the amount of comments explaining why paper bags are bad are getting a bit much. I know paper bags are shit right now I'm questioning why they havn't been updated. It would need to be coupled with an overhaul to logging industry and sustainable harvesting practices ect ect think about it for 2 extra seconds.

rm9ooa,"This is a very important point. 

From what I recall of US media coverage at the time (I was in junior high) it was easy to get the impression that the Tiananmen protests were essentially about democracy.

Part of what encouraged this was the global context. A slew of Eastern European regimes were falling or about to fall. Watching from the US, people really wanted to believe not only that communism was dying but that democracy was on the rise everywhere. There were even dumb optimistic pop songs like “Right Here, Right Now.” 

So a lot of Americans like me, who knew nothing about Chinese history or politics, got swept up in what we believed was the immanent triumph of democracy (and the American Way™️) across the globe.

>Justice, and the enforcement of it, has changed. In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors' dirty work.

>Into this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.

>  

><i>Note: In the Summer 2014 season, Psycho-Pass was rebroadcast and re-edited to fit into an hour time-slot, ending up in 11 one-hour episodes. This edit included added scenes at the beginning and middle of the episodes, as well as fixing and improving animation.</i>

hq0klo,"A word or two from Trump, and every Congress critter out there against him would have bricks thrown through their office windows, their families harassed, and who knows what other chaos.

It's no surprise that when other parts of government give him trouble, he lets things fall into chaos.  Every citizen who's ever said fuck the politicians, fuck the lawyers, fuck the media, eats out of his hand. 

He's the choice of a people who've been backed into a wall, cast aside, considered redundant, too old and out of touch to make a difference. 

The ""fuck it, let it burn"" faction is huge, they don't answer polls, they don't play the media's game, they don't do town halls. 

Whatever the outcome of the election, the Trump mob will still be there. A seething mass of mayhem that makes the Tea Party movement look sane, and the most crazed rants of Glenn Beck like a Noam Chomsky dissertation on evolution of language in hotentot tribes over the last 500 years. 

You won't get those people back in the box short of rolling back the clock on the social justice/call-out/perpetual butthurt trends on the left.  Roll it back to Jimmy Carter era liberalism, you might avoid a civil war. Remind the left that most of those people will die in the next 10 years.

c6bjv8,"So Nazi's are people who want to gas jews, or people who are just right-winged?  The only reason I ask is because the left tends to categorize anyone with conservative beliefs as neo-Nazis.  I don't even think Richard Spencer himself supports murdering innocents.. 🤔  To be considered a terrorist, shouldn't one have to assume violent ideological positions?  So I have to hypothetically agree with your ideology (gay pride, trans-rights, open-borders, ect.) or I'm a Nazi, and by extension a 'terrorist,' which gives you the moral authority to commit violence against me and bludgeon me with a bike lock.  That's scary..  

I understand categorizing violent groups like this, but then why weren't these specific groups on the list in the first place?  Are those groups definitively violent?  I haven't even heard of any of them.  Or are they just white nationalist drones?

n4rp6l,"There was a comment featuring a link that was deleted just a few minutes ago here. The link was to a video showing the brutal murder of a young girl (probably ~20 or under by her appearance) on the streets of Medellín Colombia. While very little can be confirmed outright over the internet quickly, I have no doubt that the poster was accurate in his explanation that she had been killed by police attacks in reaction to the protests. There are plenty more videos like it in other linked subs here in this comment chain, so I’m going to re-paste my message on it bellow 🔻

I’ve seen enough blood and gore for a lifetime and I knew I wasn’t going to enjoy what was shown, but I clicked anyway. I clicked because of the people who suffer and die for nothing important, so that a few power hungry and egotistical and morally bankrupt individuals can live lavishly on stolen wealth, so that those individuals are not forgotten or swept under the rug. If you don’t want to see pure horrific brutality, no one will blame you, do not click that link. If you want an honest show of how bad this world can be when we allow petty tyrants to rule, if you want to know the face of an innocent to at least keep them in your memory, if you want to understand hell a little better and know what we are all fighting against - do that girl the honor of looking at her body. I’m half Colombian, I’ve walked the streets of that city and I will again, much of my family still lives in that country. For them and the millions of others who still must face that tyranny, for the billions around the world who are two steps from that same hell, watch that video, internalize the madness, and prepare yourself to face it down EVERY.

n4rp6l,You’re spewing a false narrative and you know it. There’s a difference between owning a simple firearm for personal safety and owning 20 automatic rifles with bump stocks that you feel you should be able to haul everywhere (without proper screening). Common sense screening and closing loopholes is not “taking guns away”. I think the thing that scares a lot of Americans is the fact that they know if there was actual qualified screening a lot of them wouldn’t qualify to own a weapon without a loophole…because they’re certifiable! 🤦‍♀️,2021-05-05 11:27:32

n4rp6l,"Yeah but raising the taxes on it's citizens while in the middle of a pandemic lockdown is not the way lol. Specially when they don't raise the taxes on the few very rich people that actually control the country.

Productivity can wait, people are currently struggling to survive. It's just really bad timing.

Also, farming and stuff just isn't really that profitable in Colombia anymore. Besides a few products, stuff like live stock just takes a lot of effort and capital to set up, its a pain in the ass to manage, and you end up not making enough money to make it worth your time. Also with global warming, it's getting harder and harder to get the same kinds of outputs at the same quality as you used to be able to.

Imo, the Colombian job market is out-dated. There's so many useless and unproductive jobs that only exist because ""well if they remove that job, what are they going to do?"" The people that pump your gas, the people that sit in elevators and press the buttons for you, the shitty ""almost"" waitresses, the people that stand outside the bathroom and charge for entry, a production line entirely dependent on trucks (no trains to be seen!), taxis absolutely everywhere (with extremely strong unions that prevent competition like Uber or Lyft from taking hold!) 

Hell the one time I went to a bank and they payed  someone to fucking press the buttons on a screen for you while you told them which button to touch. 🙄 It made me feel disgusting having all these people do these jobs that I could very well do myself, like I was getting pampered or something. 

Stop incetivicing complacency and laziness. Get rid of these stupid jobs and force people to be productive members of society or starve. There is no growth if people know that they can still survive if they don't try hard.

I watched this one develop in astonishment at its creation, blind Freddy could have told you Putin was going to invade on the back of Zelenskys insistence that  Ukraine had a right to join NATO ,mysteriously dropped 1 week after the invasion.

The response was preprepared, coordinated & planned

Wall to wall coverage of the bearded freedom fighter Zelensky & lots of Putin at his 50 seater dining table, snappy catch phrases everyone could remember
 Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦 

A battle of good against evil, the tech savvy made for TV (literally) President v the evil boomer

Anyone who questioned it was a Russian bot or Putin apologist, once the seed was planted every kid in his bedroom ensured the story was supported, like mini cnn fact checkers


Americans didn't realise how critical Ukraine was to them, but at least it wasn't as confusing as Iran & Iraq sounding so similar & he looked like us this time.

Once the narrative was set time for the sting....

$40 billion dollars that's $40,000,000,000.00.

Not a loan..  a gift card to buy weapons, that's on top of the $18 billion they were already given him

They had just wasted $3 trillion dollars on Afghanistan & Iraq, arms sales were down 17% last year due to an outbreak of peace.


The astonishing thing is a whole new generation just fell for the same grift.

There was a protest for 2 days, then Russia invaded Crimea, and THEN the pro-Russian president was ousted. Russia's actions directly lead to the coup, and he knows it.

Mostly what makes me mad about it, is that they get to enjoy the perks and privilege of living and owning homes and businesses in the US or UK as well as having citizenship, yet they do all this bullshit to avoid paying the taxes that fund it.

pjkb15,"I've been vegetarian for twenty years and have converted my partner just by the sheer power of spices for quite a few things. The amount of variety and replication of textures is way more on point almost on a monthly basis now. The big thing is like any prepacked food you can't just stick it in the microwave and expect the best. 

Burgers/ ground beef-the beyond brand or garden ultimate. Add vegan Worcester + dark soy sauce + onion/onion powder and you can fool anyone. The texture is spot on. You can make stuff like meatloaf accurately as well. Fake meatballs are generally spot on even with store brands. 

Chicken- all the chicken has the proper textures. Adobo blue without pepper makes it taste exactly like chicken for any stir fry or pan fried need, the fake nuggets are preferred by literally everyone that tries them.

Breakfast-morningstar farms bacon, cooked in butter with a touch of light or dark soy sauce. It gets crispy and smoky. Beyond sausage patties are texture correct and don't need any help with seasoning unless you want to throw some sage or thyme on it.

Vegan hot dogs are so much better my grandad switched completely. Plus, no biproducts 🤢

Vegan cheese isn't quite there yet, the ones that are anywhere close are gourmet cheese prices so I don't do as much testing with that. But vegan butter and mayo are good, oatmilk is great, vegan ranch is like better than normal ranch. Cream cheese is off still it seems tho. 

Dark soy sauce, vegan Worcester, za'ataar, onion powder, vegan butter. By those powers combined with the modern textures, there's not much to miss if you like to cook.",2021-09-07 14:16:38

This is some trite ass bullshit.  First of all if you live in a developed country you've heard of climate change and the various causes of it.  I've seen some of the most ignorant fucking people in the world making smart ass comments about cow farts being bad for the environment.  Most of the meat consumption in this world happens in developed countries.  And do you think that all the people in developing countries are all uneducated and have no access to information.  Internet access has grown just a little over the last 20 years.

>nor do they have the luxury of comfort to think about it.

The luxury of comfort? Please.  How many hours of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. have human beings from all demographics consumed over the last year and a half of this pandemic and you suggest that thinking about the environment is a luxury of comfort.

Backhanded passing the blame to the population of the third world and then chastising everyone for not having empathy for the corporations driving this bus is some fucking amazing gold medal worthy mental gymnastics

His father was KICKED from the party, and Xi worked his way to the top from the fucking bottom.
-every dictator POS has some sob story boo hoo. Hitler was rejected from art school. Poor baby. Bad argument. And you literally prove my point that the CCP is unfair.

My experience with the NHS (talking about the area I live in) has been quite bad. I am not the only one saying this, as most people that come from other western countries agree with me. Having to call the clinic 20 times at 8 AM to end up not getting an appointment or to be given some ibuprofen? Really? 

Waiting times in the hospital are terrible, and not because a lot of people were using it. I was once in emergencies and there was literally no one but a me an a poor girl with a bleeding head injury. It took them an hour to see her (about 3 hours to get me sorted; ibuprofen in the end). I have a hernia (diagnosed in Spain) but they are adamant that it is a ""pulled muscle"". A pulled muscle that has been going on for 3 years and once impeded me to walk for a day because it was pressing my spinal cord nerve.

fsb0vs,"Zookeeper here. 

Some zoos/sanctuaries here in the US are doing this, too. My best friend works at a bonobo sanctuary and their emergency plan is to all stay on site and bring their pets. They haven't instituted it yet (low number of infections in their area so far), but apes are incredibly susceptible to respiratory infections. If the bonobos somehow got infected and spread it to each other, they would definitely all die. 

Other zoos are working in teams. Half the staff doesn't have contact with the other half and common spaces are disinfected in between shifts. Co-workers are having lunch breaks from an appropriate distance away and limiting contact. AFAIK pretty much every zoo in the USA has been closed to visitors.

It gets tricky to socially distance in animal care. If an animal is sick or injured and needs medical attention, you might need to be close to another person as they help you restrain it and administer treatment. With dangerous animals like large carnivores some zoos are accustomed to working in two-person teams for safety reasons. There are also tasks we're used to executing as a team, like hay deliveries, that basically require everyone to be in close proximity. People are doing their best to come up with solutions but unfortunately there are no perfect ones. And since most zoos have had to put a freeze on hiring for the season, they're already understaffed. Without guests around, that does free up some time, but people are definitely feeling the strain.

We take emergency planning pretty seriously in the accredited zoo world (what with deadly animals around and all...). So most facilities have been working hard at socially distancing before local municipalities even took it seriously. My concern right now is all the shitty private zoos/roadside attractions/private exotic animal breeders that are out there. Those places are totally not equipped to deal with this and a lot of those animals are going to starve to death when the owners get sick. ☹️",2020-03-31 14:32:25

fquwh8,"Perhaps we are both right. Suppose the former king did what you describe at Thammasat University exactly as you describe it - and yet a huge majority of Thais would not agree that he was a “terrible man”. He was and is deeply loved and profoundly respected by vast percentage of Thais. Theravada Buddhism has kind of melded with concept of Monarchy. He is perceived in a Thai sort of way as something of a Gandhi. Stated differently differently, many, I would say most, Americans love JFK. Yet he did some awfully shitty things a some resulting loss of life. Do Americans love him any less? But the former king was more than a politician. Like Gandhi he was perceived as a spiritual leader and was/is almost more than a mere human. I don’t have your post in front of me but as I recall you spoke of “forcibly brainwashed”. I lived there for ten years - taught English at Thammasat Rangsit, and married a Thai and traveled all over Asia. Thailand is unique. I know of no leader in the USA where a leader is so reverenced and adored. Deeply. Of there own volition. The people I refer to would passionately disagree with you that the past king was evil or horrible. He was/is seen as a loving father. Thais can hold two opposing ideas in their head like no culture I’ve ever seen. It’s exasperating at times. Buts it’s Thailand and the unique mix of culture, Theravada Buddhism and the monarchy as it relates specifically to the former king.

It’s silly, they are comparable to hyper right wing religious conservative Christians you see in the US, think Q followers level of stupid. The problem is like many of those types they can be from all kinds of fields and it will surprise you how somewhat smart people can also be so smooth in the brain. 

India wasn’t like this before Modi and the BJP have successfully turned India off the path of secularism to one of extremist right wing Hindu nationalism.

It’s absolutely pathetic, think back 20 years ago, the image of India was a more inclusive one. It’s just maddening how much damage this group of people have done to the country, if there is a direction change in the future it will take a whole generation for them to repair the damage done.

j2tziw,"As a Republican (former as of this year, technically more Libertarian, I just want my guns and low taxes and my legal marijuana) the quality in GOP leadership just exponentially drops between 2008 to 2012, then even more so in 2016. You have this 'old Guard' element (lead by your Karl Roves etc) that somehow devolved into a 'cult of personality' around Trump that exists today. There was a brief moment of hope with the Tea Party to clean house, and to some degree it did work, but you then had a new batch of bs come in (which is what post 2016 pretty much has been).

On the plus side, I don't even know if the GOP has plans post-Trump (which the old shadowy Karl Rove cabal of before had long-term plans) so maybe a chance for things to change \*shrug\*

Honestly, the fact that Romney was the ONLY one to stand up to Trump during the impeachment just tells you the core GOP leadership is completely hollow at this point... (EDIT - in case you wonder, this is pretty much when I gave up on the GOP as a party 🥳)",2020-10-01 02:59:36

Because the T34 is a completely different tank and he's not a fan of that one? 😂

T34s were much more shoddily built, and indeed have fewer fans of them than panzers. Germans are well known for very satisfying high quality mechanical work.

EDIT: I am aware this was likely a Ukrainian S300 which failed to intercept a Russian target. The loss of life remains as tragic as any other in this war, though it is Ukraine’s right to defend its territory. 

I would hope that an expeditious deployment of high grade western anti-air systems, from Patriot to C-RAM comes of this. Ukraine should not need to even consider defending itself with 1970s soviet junk that might as well be a bow and arrow compared to what we have.",2022-11-16 01:48:19

Times have changed but values should be the same. USA is a country that accepts, protects, & provides based on the Constitution. This a document that should fluidly evolve with our society. 
In my opinion, domestic white national extremists who create terror upon our society are worse then those with hatred directed at our country no matter their race or religion. 
While resources are directed to contain short sighted ignorate racist. These resources could be spent finding extremist groups of all cultural backgrounds & religions around the world.

A recent exciting one (🤓) happened provincially in BC.   

Just a bit of background. If you don't care, skip to after the line break.  

Federally, in Canada, we have five major parties (from left wing to right) NDP; Green; Liberal; Bloc Quebecois; Progressive Conservatives (a second con party ""People's Party"" will be on the ballot for their first election, so IDK if I can include them here yet). We had two major conservatives (one fiscal con, one social con) but they merged. AKA merged so they dont split the vote for right wing.  

In BC, our Libs are Cons and the NDP is Liberal. The actual conservative party hasn't had a seat since the 70s, I believe.   

_____
So the last election (2017) the Libs got 43 seats, the NDP 41, and the Green party 3. The Libs minority government was toppled by the NDP and Greens forming a coalition government with their total 44 seats. It was very exciting. Since in power, the NDP/Greens have dropped the toll on a major bridge into Vancouver, removed MSP premiums, and reworked the Gov't run car insurance (I'll be paying $500 less). The tax money from weed surely went a long way, but this is what Gov't should be-- working for the people, not gouging them.",2019-09-09 23:43:23

pfmo96,"In German there's what's called the ""generic masculinum"", because most of our words have a male and female version (think actor vs actress - ""Schauspieler"" vs ""Schauspielerin""). Of course you can easily guess from the context whether you are using a form as the generic version or really talk about a male individual, so in everyday life this is not an issue at all.

But there are people who believe this is Very Problematic™ and propose ""awesome"" solutions that range from using both forms (""Schauspieler und Schauspielerinnen"" - ""actors and actresses"") over using the participle (""acting persons"" - ""Schauspielenden"") (which is also very common for students (""Studierende"" - ""studying ones"")) over inserting chars (""Schauspieler:in"", ""Schauspieler*in"") to completely crazy things such as inventing completely new endings (""Schauspiely"") that sound more like something taken from some slavic language...

What those people do not realize is that this adds gender in places where it's irrelevant. If someone tells me ""this is group of very bad actors"" then it's just about that, regardless of gender. If someone says ""this is a group of very bad actors and actresses"" then the focus shifts to the fact that there are both genders, even though gender never mattered there. Another example: ""I'm going to the baker to buy some food for my friends"". Not gendered, because it's irrelevant. But the p.c. version would now be ""I'm going to he 'bakeress' or baker to buy some food for my friends and girlfriends"".",2021-09-01 09:24:22

I don't see Putin just giving up or accepting defeat. He's essentially going all out, and to lose would be very embarrassing and bad for him(obviously). But do to this, I feel like he will just launch nukes in a last ditch effort rather than facing the sanctions and oppression that would follow from the rest of the world for attempting this. 

I feel like the best outcome for this to avoid nuclear warfare is, unfortunately, for Russia to take Ukraine swiftly.(hopefully with few casualties as possible). With no ground troop interference from NATO, Russia realizes the threat worked. China does too and they invade Tawain, this just proceeds to a domino affect. Realizing NATO won't interfere with threats of nuclear war. However where do you draw the line? Does that mean they can just essentially do what the please as long as they dont touch a NATO member? NATO wouldn't let this happen, which is the scary part. 

TLDR: -Russia loses = Nukes.
           -Russia wins = they can do what they please which wouod eventually =Nukes
Almost seems as if nuclear war is inevitable.

WILBERFORCE: Mr Huxley, would you be offended if I asked you who the APE in your
family was? Maybe your grandmother or grandfather?

HUXLEY: My Lord, Charles Darwin is saying that we are ALL DESCENDED from
apes. The last person in my family to actually LOOK like an ape was
possibly my great great great great great, great great great great great,
great great great great great, great great great great great grandmother!

WILBERFORCE: Yes, and my great great great great great, great great great great great,
great great great great great, great great great great great grandfather
could have looked like a MONKEY!

SCIENTIST 1: Actually, evolution happens over hundreds of generations, meaning that
you would have to say the word ‘great’ hundreds of times. To put it more
precisely, the last of your ancestors to represent a monkey would have
been your great great great great great….

WILBERFORCE: Enough! Where does your evidence come from?

SCIENTIST 1: Palaeontologists.

SCIENTIST 2: Genealogists.

SCIENTIST 3: Archaeologists.

SCIENTIST 4: Zoologists.

HUXLEY: Along with many other ‘ists!’

WILBERFORCE: Stop using big words to blind us with science!

HUXLEY: My Lord, we are not trying to BLIND you. We are trying to SHOW you.

easy on the big words will you?""

yes, among a Labour membership swelled with far left £3 entryists. And as I said the Labour membership is a tiny proportion of the UK population, meaning that Corbyn is still “extremely unpopular”. 

Ironically your article complaining of “media bias” against Corbyn is itself writted by a biased pro-Corbyn journalist. 

It also doesn’t really matter. Minus 60% approval is minus 60%, regardless of the cause, and is plenty enough reason to dump him as Labour leader. 

I wonder, could it be that the reason he gets criticised so much and is loathed by the general public is because he is an antisemitic eurosceptic Marxist who has has a history of cosying up with terrorists and dictatoships? Maybe that is the reason? 🙄",2019-11-16 14:00:13

And, to the men commenting about child support - I think if abortion is legal, but a woman decides to keep her baby and the man does not want it, he should be able to sign away his parental rights and not support it. Likewise, if a woman wants to abort, but the man is insistent upon her keeping the baby, he should then be legally bound to provide support. Ugh. It’s not that difficult 😞",2020-12-31 22:36:02

I'm lucky that it'll only cost me a grand out of pocket when I give birth. None of us are in ANY position to tell a woman that she should sacrifice her autonomy, her physical safety, her long term general wellbeing, her career, her financial stability, in 30% of women, her CONTINENCE, because some guy didn't keep track of his jizz and how there's an embryo involved (millions of which are tossed in medical waste via fertility clinics with, oddly, no one out front holding signs and screaming at people).

My friend had her gums swell so badly she lost multiple crowns and had to go without fucking TEETH. My sister almost died during childbirth. It's literally a life threatening condition. And it's literally torture for many of us, even if you want to have a baby. It is absolutely inhumane and straight up evil to force that upon someone. No one WANTS an abortion. They just want the right not to put their life and wellbeing at risk for something that doesn't have cognition, doesn't feel pain, doesn't have rights in an IVF clinic. And later on in gestation, women want the right to make hard decisions when wanted pregnancies are found to be fruitless.

Abortion is healthcare. Doctors aren't out murdering babies. They're saving women. The best way to reduce abortion, statistically, is by providing better services to women that allow them to access birth control, get good education, and, we haven't tried this one in the US yet, but maybe even offer safety nets that make it possible to be a mother without years of financial planning? Half of women don't even qualify for FMLA at all, which is almost never paid anyways. I got sixty percent pay for six weeks. Dogs get eight weeks. For my pregnancies I have had to save up literally months of expenses to take a mere three month leave to be with my newborn baby. But the people advocating taking women's rights to autonomy don't want their tax dollars helping women keep the baby either 🙃",2021-01-01 05:20:17

>If we give ten people ten dollars each, that's $100 spent. If we take back $100 starting with the richest people first, we get $100 back.

It's amazing how smug you people can be about ""People won't change their behaviour in response to taxation, we can just write ourselves cheques based on the net worths and incomes of rich people. Like you actually think mainstream economists ""can't do math and are trying to scare you""? 😂

The French Socailist government (and I mean that with a capital S, I'm not an American calling everything I don't like Socialist, these are self-described) instituted a 75% marginal tax rate in 2013 on incomes above a million euros. Much like you, they did the math assuming no behaviour would change with this powerful disincentive against high earning. They were following the advice of famous French Socialist ""Rock Star Economist"" Thomas Piketty.

So what happened?

[They had to scrap it after a year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonhartley/2015/02/02/frances-75-supertax-failure-a-blow-to-pikettys-economics/#540fa1ed5df2). Their TOTAL tax collection, not just from the supertax, was HALF of what they estimated. This is how poorly your ""socialist math"" fares in reality.

casual reminder that the people responsible for designing and executing apartheid in South Africa met with and visited the people responsible for the atrocities committed against the First Nations people of Canada - not just for tea and beaver pelts - for ADVICE on how to be effective and organized

I originally learned about it as we studied works by Nadine Gordimer in my English class last semester

The [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada%E2%80%93South_Africa_relations) just says “The Constitution of South Africa was, in part, inspired by the Constitution of Canada, particularly the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms” which is an oversimplification, as they came to study the Indian act, status cards (which we continue to use and they do not,) and removal of a number of civil liberties and, overall, autonomy. The Indian Act remains in place.

I found a number of references from local news outlets and links to academic journals. Here are some options for additional reading from a variety of sources so you can find one that you hopefully find credible 🤍

> Indian Act, 1876

>The most important single act affecting First Nations is the Indian Act, passed by the federal government of the new Dominion of Canada in 1876 and still in existence today. The Indian Act was another attempt to assimilate First Nations people into Canadian society as quickly as possible. Under section 91(24) of the British North America Act (1867), the federal government was given jurisdiction or control over “Indians and Lands reserved for Indians,” providing exclusive authority over Indian affairs. You can read the complete Indian Act online.[1]
Who is an “Indian”?

>In the Indian Act, the Government of Canada defines who is an “Indian.” If the government defines you as an “Indian,” you are said to have “Status.” For this reason, “Indian” is a legal word, but not one that many Indigenous people are comfortable using to describe themselves.
[OpenText BC - The Indian Act](https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfoundations/chapter/the-indian-act/)

[Canada’s persistent apartheid system](https://troymedia.com/viewpoint/indigenous-apartheid-system-canada/)

The following is an excerpt from EXTRACTION EMPIRE: Undermining the Systems, States, and Scales of Canada’s Global Resource Empire, 2017-1217 (MIT Press: 2018), originally published as “Canada’s Apartheid: The Sanctioned Diffusion of Canadian Strategies of Indigenous Segregation, Assimilation, and Extermination” and found for citation here on LapsusLima
> “There is sufficient evidence to suggest and confirm that South African government officials received direct information, influence, and inspiration from Canada and its Native reservation system in conceiving and establishing spatial methods of racial segregation.”

Sorry for this rant but it seems very likely, based on past discoveries that this happened under the watch of that huge false so-called ‘church’ cult that has been responsible for world-wide atrocities including massacring more genuine Jesus-followers than any other organisation ever. They bring gross lies & dishonour on the loving name of Christ (means Messiah). 

They (mainly) promote a man-made, counterfeit, unbiblical, sanctimonious chUrchianity. An adapted strange version that twists, ignores and misinterprets God’s Word, yet DARES to shamefully claim a connection with The WORD of God Himself ~ Jesus! 

This long-term, apostate caricature of Jesus’  ‘church’ ~ (Few individuals within it realise its massively faulty & thereby eternally dangerous due to false teaching) ~ whose leader comes from an organisation whose members take a vow to destroy real Jesus+Bible following christians
 - that unchristian leader is NOW currently involved in forming & promoting the END TIMES Anti-Christ ‘one-world-religion’.... PROPHESIED in the Bible, that denies the basic Gospel (Good News) of Jesus being the only means The Lord has given mankind whereby ANYONE can be saved (God’s words, not mine!)

The rising one-world-religion of which God (yhwh of The Bible) warns human-kind, will tolerate ANY diverse anti-God (yhwh) belief systems, all of which The Bible makes clear will guarantee to take adherents to hell!.... 

However, God tells us in the Bible (which is history written in advance) that this Anti-Christ One-World-Religion will vilify, exclude & persecute His true blood-bought, supernaturally spiritually-alive, BELIEVERS in & disciples of The Living Lord Jesus...ie genuine biblical ‘christians’  who have been entrusted with Jesus’s message of salvation according to Jesus (Yeshua’s) own teaching, until in the End end times the Jews will recognise Yeshua HaMashiach (Jesus Messiah) and reach the world. 

Atrocities! They’ve dragged the name of Jesus (Yeshua) through sewage so much of the world thinks that’s ‘christian’ - disgusting.

And in the end we are all the same, just with different journeys and perspectives in this chaotic experiment called life. 

Many Canadians know the term Seme7 (shum-uh) for a white person (which can sometimes be a pejorative). However, there were Europeans (from France I believe) that actually worked alongside the Indigenous people here and had a mutually beneficial relationship. They respected each other and the French respected the laws. We call them seme7 ui7 (Shum-uh oo-ee), which means the ""real white person,"" and is a term of respect. I believe that we can get to a place where this is the reality. Where we see, understand and appreciate each others real selves and live in Harmony.

nmny97,"Wow, I am so sorry that you had to go through all of that. I know it might not be worth much, but I'm proud of you for managing to take control and get clean even though you weren't given all of the tools to do so. That is a monstrous achievement.

It also seems like you've taken the pain you have previously endured, and you've turned it into empathy for others. It would be just as easy to harbour resentment and anger, but you have chosen compassion instead. There is something to be said for that. If everyone showed others compassion from their pain, the world would be a much better place. So, thank you. 

I agree with you about the mental health piece, 100%. I also think that *everyone* can benefit from having a therapist. There doesn't have to be something inherently ""broken"" for you to be able to experience growth as a person -- and therapists can help with that. I just wish more people saw and understood that, instead of thinking that only people with mental health conditions should see someone. 

I don't know what country you live in, but (assuming it's a democratic government) I hope you're able to vote in mental healthcare where you are, and I also hope you're able to connect with a therapist who understands your particular needs. ❤️",2021-05-28 17:36:26

The two present to him a gift that they say shows how Trump’s name adds up to the same numbers as the Jewish messiah, a reference to the Jewish mystical practice of Gematria. In Gematria, every Hebrew letter is assigned a numerical value, and the sums of those values are then compared to numerical values of other words or phrases to identify hidden meanings or connections.

“The messiah comes out to 424. Your name, your name, it adds up to his name. So it’s 424, 424,” Parnas says.

Fruman adds: “So all Jew people of Ukraine, they are praying for you.” Another unidentified voice tells Trump to “talk to Jared, he’ll explain it to you” — a reference to Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is an observant Jew.”

etw1f4,"> You do understand that a felon is someone that has been convicted of a felony? 

Yes how is this relevant? 

> You are asking me why someone would demand that subordinates fire another subordinate

I am asking ""Why did Trump direct a room of foreign nationals to ""take out"" the ambassador when he was the only one in the room with the authority to do so? 

> Have you ever worked anywhere? This is pretty standard.

Yes, although I've never had my boss request a different company to ""take me out"" when he wanted me gone. 

>If it’s perfectly w/in his rights to fire this person than why is it a big deal that he discussed firing this person? 

Then why did Trump ask the room of foreign officials to ""take out"" the ambassador for him, if he's well within his own rights to fire them himself? 

> I’ve noticed that people tend to say things like go shill somewhere once they’ve realized their position has been compromised. Did you ever push the button I invented? Come on...just push it 😁

Maybe that's where you learnt it, because of the 10+ comments that have posted a similar sentiment, not one of them has been able to answer this question directly. The reason they can't is because it compromises the position ""he's within his rights to fire her, who cares!"" and it also calls into question a lot of statements he's made about his motiviations and reason for doing this.",2020-01-26 01:24:38

If you're curious to see what's in nunes memo the **full 99 page FISA court memo** is right here:

https://www.scribd.com/embeds/%20369818480/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=%20scroll&amp;access_key=key-%20iGnCG9dyD250SdypleNY&amp;show_recommendations=true

Leaked yesterday, you can see they are very much fucked. Nunes memo is just a summary of the above with the few redactions included.

You can tell they are panicking when they say this:

>the **Justice Department has expressed serious concerns about the memo’s potential release.** In a letter sent to Nunes on Jan. 24, Stephen Boyd, the department’s top congressional liaison, wrote that **“it would be extraordinarily reckless for the Committee to disclose such information publicly without giving the Department and the FBI the opportunity to review the memorandum and to advise the HPSCI [the House intelligence committee] of the risk of harm to national security and to ongoing investigations that could come from public release.”**

https://www.thedailybeast.com/doj-warns-that-releasethememo-would-be-extraordinarily-reckless?ref=home

I expect ad hominem attacks since no one can really refute this intelligently or argue anything contrary.

Edit: Downvoting isn't going to change anything .
It just shows you don't want people to read the memo to see the truth.
Edit 2: People wanna say this is not it because it's dated last year, but remember the FISA court hearings was last year and that's when this memo was originally made that Nunes summary version is based off of. Be weary of deception.

So I guess you’re technically right in a sense... of someone takes the common narrative (which can be discredited) as fact, then I guess that’d discredit them as well, because that’s such an ignorant thing to do. What I’m saying is that’s not the point I was trying to make and my goal was not to discredit any individual.

ojl0sw,"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

US coal consumption has been decreasing since 2007 and recently hit its lowest consumption since the 1970’s. We are by no means trying to “sell” it, just making a point that it has to remain in the system for the foreseeable future until renewables can consistently generate power.

Before 650 A.D (somewhere around then.... ) Jews and Christians lived in peace in the promise land known as Israel. Mohammed comes, drives them all out, kills them, imprisons then, forces them to convert to Islam simply because they refused to implement the doctrine of Islam. They are treated as second class citizens. Now, in order to remain a Jew living under Islamic rule had have to pay the something called the jizziah (which is basically like protection money) or you had to die or maybe leave (if leaving was an option). And I’m not making this up. It states this in the Quran: 

** Fight those who believe not in God and in the Last Day, and who do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden, and who follow not the Religion of Truth among those who were given the Book, till they pay the jizyah with a willing hand, being humbled.**

Now, this continues until around 1095 when Christians and Jews who are, according to the Quran, *the worst of creatures*, are now being treated like shit, they ask the Vatican “hey, they’re killing us or extorting us... we can’t live like this anymore... help etc. “ So you know what happens? Vatican had the biggest army in the world (or at least one of the biggest) — so they attacked Israel in hopes of getting back WHAT WAS RIGHTFULLY THEIRS. 

So when you hear Muslims talk about how disgusting Christians were to kill so many Muslims  and how they were so innocent etc. Nah boo, you don’t know your history. 😘

I don’t know the exact dates but they managed to get back Israel for about 90 years. Muslims reinvaded it back again and it has been theirs until 1919when the treaty of Versailles gave it back to the Jews. THEIR rightful land. Where all their heritage and history is. 


Now many Palestinian sympathisers are probably reading this really triggered at this point saying they’re bombing us, the children etc. And I agree, if I just took your statement as face value I would also probably be emotionally triggered to believe and act and quack like you: 

Israel has tried to go into a 2 state solution with “Palestine” 4 times. What does Palestine do? Instead of taking the offer or maybe immigrating to jordan (which is where they’re really from) or another Muslim country where they would probably treat them like KINGS. No... what they do is they democratically elect Hamas, a terrorist organization who has vowed to not to rest until until every single Jew is dead. Now that’s dark. These people don’t want peace. They should ha e thought twice about “peace” before they went around attacking Israel. Israel is defending itself. It is literally surrounded by enemies all over. And they don’t want to stop. I only feel sorry for the children because the ones that don’t get a say in this. But if you want to sit behind the children and pretend like Israel is just bombing children for the banter and just completely ignore all other factors than you can stay there in ur ignorance. I don’t know what to tell u. 

Israel is the only country where gay rights exist; the only country where Christians, Jews and Muslims can all go their holy sites without any fear. Christians or Jews can’t go to Mecca FYI. The only country where you can leave your religion, become an apostate (as a Muslim) and not be in fear of death or imprisonment. Where women’s rights exist, where women are not first property of their fathers than of their husbands. And if you’re a Muslim and you’re like “you’re misunderstanding the texts it doesn’t say this...” blah blah blah I don’t care. I live on planet Earth. The fact is in every single Muslim country, women are treated like dirt. Their rights trampled on, the laws against them. And Islam is the common denominator in all these countries. And same thing for gays and apostates. I have read the Quran cover to cover and this is the conclusion I’ve come to.

It’s not the Ukraine joining the EU in the near future was being talked about after which they’d give up their political independence 🥳


https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-40522646/ukraine-eu-membership-will-become-a-truth

Did anyone really believe Russia would let the most important naval base in the Black Sea get assimilated into NATO? 
Especially seeing as it was only given to the Ukraine by a pro Ukrainian Kruschef? ( can’t remember the spelling ) because he loved the land and wanted to give it more power in the internal structure of the Soviet Union.",2020-06-18 13:26:55
hbbds9,"I laid out a whole list of shit he said with some citations for someone I have now blocked on Facebook because her only response to that was “😴” and I was done.

This was someone who added me when she came to pay her condolences when my mother passed, and all she did was send me Jesus and Trump material and I got fed up with it. I tried talking about it, providing context, nothing helped. That snooze emoji and a video on her profile about how the protests recently “have accomplished nothing” finally put me over the edge.",2020-06-18 14:19:18

Later, he was released and guarded at all times for his own protection. This was all the official action of an official government recognized by the international community.

In my opinion, the legitimate elected leader of a country was seized by men working at the behest of foreign intelligence, sentenced and imprisoned under false pretenses, then died in his home after years as a political prisoner cut off from society. It depends entirely on whether you believe that the Shah was the legitimate leader of the country and was therefore within his rights to support the wishes of his allies and deal with an enemy of the state 🤷‍♂️

I have said elsewhere that I regret the implication that he was murdered, it was a haphazard response. I do believe that his kidnapping and confinement contributed to his death but in haste I overstated the case.",2022-04-20 23:48:12

This is from the CDC 
https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html

“In the decade before 1963 when a vaccine became available, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age. It is estimated 3 to 4 million people in the United States were infected each year. Also each year, among reported cases, an estimated 400 to 500 people died, 48,000 were hospitalized, and 1,000 suffered encephalitis (swelling of the brain) from
Measles”

Your uncle is not counted as a death based on statistics for natural hazard deaths because that  was not the direct cause of death.

NOAA has had a consistent way of counting natural hazard deaths since 1951. With the exception of adding riptides in the 90s as a catagory.

If I ever expand my research to Porto Rico (which I probably won't) your uncle and people who died from lack of Medical care would not be included. 

Those who died from heat stroke or a tornado associated with the hurricane would be under those specific catagories with a note about the hurricane.

We the people across the globe the ones that see what is happening are paralyzed between believing the the world is ending do to one cosmic cataclysm or another, believing that religion is coming to revelations (best word I could conjoure) in one prophecy or another, or believing that a secret society is attempting the largest scale global tyranny ever. My question to you is, considering the crises what are our options?

Cosmic cataclysm (the earths geology, a interstellar asteriod phenomenon, or our sun getting to angry) basically nothing we could to. We could bunker up or try to leave the planet accept we could only survive for so long and odds are of there was a true cataclysm the idea of returning or emerging within an ice age is pretty slim.

Religion? Who knows honestly? If anyone can say 100% without a particle of doubt that their belief system is correct and EVERY other is wrong and essentially doomed for eternity? Honest as the sunrise as far as I can tell is the there is no way any one religion is right. Yet the universal message is make peace not war Love over hate dont tollerate immoral ( being majority belief of what is right and wrong ) behavior. If your not a piece of shit. Your good.

Society? We can stand back and let whoever make decisions that will in time dictate our lives. Allow elitists controlling your food intake, associations, hobbies, freetime, occupation, productivity, health(mental physical biological)? While living like literal God's themselves taking and doing as they please using the people as geniue pigs, pawns in a boardgame, potentially committing heiness acts partaking in things we would not allow. Could be fine and dandy, could be hell on earth for man woman and child globally. Fortunately. WE can do something about this and we HAVE TO! It is, we the peoples, CHOICE and DUTY to one another and our children to decide what we allow to be done to others and to our rock🌎🌎🌏 what do we want? Or do you want? to be able to quit your job tell the boss to shove it? Marry a crush instead of a Assignment? See your children smile ear to ear when you tell them they're not going to school because you calle in and got a day pass to the theme park, Go 70 in a 55 bcuz your in a hurry to be somewhere other than where you are(also🎶i cant drive 55)? One sounds like someone or ones playing God building their own utopia, the other sounds like real Life.

First one is out of our hands. The second be a good person to other AND yourself. The third we can put our foot down and refuse to participate in their game of life. What do you want to do? I wish there was a way to reach everyone before we end up somewhere we do not want to be.

If u made it this far please share. If you have a solution. It is time to discuss",2022-06-15 11:42:37

First off, the elections, while legal, don't strike me as having been very legitimate. They will be called into question. 

Second, Catalaña is acting like they can just split from the Madrid government, and just do it's own thing. They can't. The EU and UN have to recognize them. They won't. 

All the farmers and anyone else who's getting EU subsidies, won't be getting them anymore. Because they won't be allowed to be their own state by the EU or Spain.

a good subset of those people seems to be more interested in making a statement and defending their position in an attempt to show how smart they are/how much they know/how they have a contrarian theory which shows how wrong everyone is, even if those ideas are easily proven to be factual wrong or mostly incorrect.

aqvr3z,"Agreed. That example makes it super clear you’re missing my point. 😳 Perhaps I’m explaining it badly. The topic has been done to death in climbing mags so feel free to google.

The point is that someone who considers themselves anything at all should have a basic knowledge of the tools of that something. 

To be a carpenter you would know how to use a saw. It not to say you do use one now. But you’ve come across one and used it previously. You are familiar with this most basic and fundamental tool.

To be a fireman you would know how to use a ladder. Perhaps you’ve not used one for a while. But you know how to. You are familiar with this most basic and fundamental tool.

To be a golfer you would know when to use a 7 iron. Perhaps you’ve not used one recently. But you know when to. You are familiar with this most basic and fundamental club.

To be a climber you would know how to use a belay plate. Perhaps like Alex Honnold you chose to climb Freerider solo. So you didn’t need one. But you are familiar with this most basic and fundamental device.

Now Edmund Hillary climbed before belay plates. Even before the stitch plate. How is it possible he is a climber? Well, among many other reasons, he was familiar with the most fundamental tools of his craft at the time he performed. And he used those tools to unimaginable effect.

To not know how to use a belay plate and be considered a climber today is like asking to be considered a carpenter without knowing how to use a saw. A fireman who doesn’t know how to use a ladder. Or a golfer who doesn’t know how to use his clubs.

The point is. Without a belay plate or some kind of autolock device you cant climb things that require a rope safely in 2019, and if it doesn't require a rope then it's not climbing. It's scrambling, or it's hiking. My friend could not have climbed Everest under his own skill set. He was able to because people with knowledge of basic climbing kit and techniques fixed ropes for him to pull on to the summit. It was an incredible feat of endurance and mental fortitude on his part. But he is the first to admit it should not be considered climbing. Because it was not. It was a hardcore endurance hike.",2019-02-15 17:57:53

i8ob2v,My mom (70) shared this New York Post on her Facebook. Her friends reacted with angry 😠 faces. I called her and told her not to share things from sources like NYP (Murdock owned) if it only makes her and her friends angry 😠. I used the call to explain to her how click bait is monetized and how exponential viral shares permeate culture. I think she understood the concept. Today I sent her 3 different links (from 3 verifiable sources) about this reporting. I consider it a teaching/proving moment.,2020-08-13 02:59:45

I said I wouldn't find a source to back your claim up when the one you posted doesn't even back up your claim.  Maybe you need to take a few courses in logic, reading comprehension, and critical thinking?

Again, what leader or organizer of a single protest has come out in support of these acts?

Again, what evidence do you have that these aren't just opportunist dicks trying to cause mayham, or take advantage of a situation for whatever their own personal reasons are?  

People being at a protest doesn't make them supporters of the protest.

Not only am I high risk because of an autoimmune disease that left permanent damage behind in my lungs (I’m now 40 & was diagnosed at 35), but I was in the hospital exactly one month ago for two days because I couldn’t breathe, had high blood pressure first & only time in my life, & a scary high white blood cell count. I wasn’t tested for the virus because it was the very first week it was officially found in the US & I hadn’t been in direct contact with anyone who had it.

Anyway, despite that, or the fact my little sister is now a police officer working with the public despite being in harm’s way, my own friend still believes the fittest surviving is fine.

Hate me for saying it. I’m sorry for your loss regardless of my feelings on the matter. 

Wish there was more in the way of intervention with these types of viruses. But unfortunately the truth is, there isn’t money involved in coming up with a vaccine for flus going around as we speak, solely because there is no telling how bad it will be and how it will effect the public. 

So pharmaceutical companies aren’t interested in coming up with vaccines for 100s of flu strains, anyone of which could be the next covid... 

Put blame where blame goes, don’t exasperate the situation because of your loss. There are people who will be out of business and work that will effect the economy in a way that may have some areas of the work to starve.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Oh and overeating is another example, or too much sun. I don’t know… is there a point where we should be left to make our own decisions?

They resist arrest, it’s the cops fault? If they get in a high speed chase and crash, that’s also the cops fault? I can list off lots of scenarios for you...

What are you going to arrest the cop on? And this is coming from someone who does not like law enforcement. Please educate yourself on laws before saying “if they get hurt during the process of arrest, they are immediately suspended and arrested”",2020-06-08 19:24:31
gz4ucf,"In his defense, putting a body camera on everyone is a much quicker goal to attain during this pandemic, vs trying to implement deep industry-wide changes that are meant to affect hiring and on-the-job practices.  Those things take time by comparison.

I'm all for the push for extra training and better tests, but I think he's right about body cameras yielding much quicker results for building an objective neutral ground.

Once you have cameras, it's a lot easier to talk about policy changes or disciplinary actions for mistakes.  And if the federal government is advocating for cameras, you can bet a minority government will insist on the presence of an independent review board.

Now if you are talking about the arresting officers interpretation of the law, he could be uneducated on it. Most law enforcement know less about laws then the average person. This is why it’s good to know your rights and be knowledgeable in law.

lic2ki,"It’s so fucked up. What’s sad is that people immigrate with this ignorant mentality that being gay is a choice. 

While being in university in Canada I’ve had multiple people from countries with this ignorant dominated ideology tell me that being gay is a choice and this is how they prove it - by torturing gay men until they denounce their homosexuality. 

I even had one ethics prof who was from Iran and she argued that gay men pretend to be gay to make their life easier, and that being gay is a choice since you can simply choose not to have sex with the same gender - literally her words. Even asking her to recognize sexual orientation is a part & protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights (along with race and gender), she disregarded it by stating Canadians are allowed to believe whatever they want, but she was taught differently from Iran. 

It’s really fucked up, I had to report her to the university’s human rights department but they didn’t do shit because I didn’t have “evidence” since I didn’t record it. Essentially she was arguing that homosexuality is a choice according to her own “ethical account” that was taught by her previous countries ideology. 

**THIS is the real danger of allowing other countries convicting human rights violations.**  ⚠️  Many individuals from that country will think it’s okay and continue to spread these type of falsehoods (whether it’s homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, racism, slavery, human trafficking).A person can base their moral-ethical compass that’s based from their previous dominated ideology they came from, even if it’s violating basic human rights, unless something is done about it.

9bzfz5,"Whew. That is a tough position to take especially on mobile. I think I can very timidly agree with that very narrowly. Lol

I would say declines in some bumble bee populations is very concerning. Honey bees are unable to pollinate crops that require buzz pollination (eg. blueberries, tomatoes, peppers, etc) or are just inefficient pollinators or other crops, so there are definitely economically important species that are of concern. While individual bumble bee species within an area may be fine now, we have seen with species like Bombus occidentalis that huge declines of very common species can happen in a matter of just a few years.  

It’s also a tough position to take because wild bee pollination is more important in more diversified agricultural systems which are important for small scale farmers. Simultaneously though, these agricultural regions tend to have more resources for bees and appear more stable. 

So I guess,,,maybe I agree. Haha. You’re asking an academic scientist to take a position on a very complicated topic — I’m trained to be unable to do so without hundreds of caveats. 🙂",2018-09-01 07:49:56

It’s not a super glamorous tech company like so many others here in the Bay Area, but they have really gone to bat for their employees throughout the pandemic in ways that the glamorous companies have not. 

I think they really stand by what they say. We’ve seen Chuck be very candid about many events over the last several years and his his emotion is very real. I guess I could be looking through rose colored glasses, but there is legitimate sincerity when Cisco tries to do the right thing. 

Super happy and grateful to work for this company 👍",2023-04-05 22:15:52

Instead of maintaining anything through small tax raises yearly or even just funding anything that didn't have to do with cops, corporations or military, we cut funding for everything needed to create a functioning society and are wondering why it's now falling apart after no maintenance work for 50+ years. We haven't been putting any money into education, healthcare, general infrastructure or social safety nets and now all those desperately needed things are such large expensive problems that they'll likely never get fixed. Covid has been a test for capitalism and it failed worse than we could ever imagine. The private companies we praised for supposedly doing everything better than the public sector crumbled the second it was put under pressure.

And that’s ok - because the time-bomb for the bigot party is ticking. Crooks get away with things to a point; then it catches up with them. The judgment day is coming, and this impeachment proceeding will be another strike of many to come, regardless of the result.

7lav0j,"It is NOT that the ""UN hates Israel"" or ""the UN hates Jews"" or you would not find the UK, among other countries, voting in favour. Seriously it is NOT about ""hating Israel"", or evdn being ""bribed by arabs"" at least for thr majority of countries. It is all about trying to make a two state peace solution possible.

As Israel already has control over all of Jerusalem it says ""Our capitol is Jersualem, eternal and undivided"". However the Palestinians want majority arab East Jerusalem as their capitol, thus most of the rest of the world thinks only west Jerusalem should go to Israel and East Jerusalem to Palestine as part of a two state solution. Hence they have not recognised Israel's claim and instead kept their embassies in Tel Aviv which is defo in Israel. They probably intend to move their embassies to W Jerusalem after any peace settlement, partly as a reward/incentive for Israel to stop being so obstinate.

They voted to condemn Trump's actions mostly because he did not specify he only meant West Jerusalem - throwing all of the previous careful diplomacy out the window - and also because he seemed to back the Israeli government's position without really making a concession to the Palestinians. Thus people are worried that the US will lose all credibility as a ""neutral"" arbitrator, making any future US mediated peace negotiations all but impossible. 

So basically this was a public show of solidarity by (most of) the world in saying ""this action is stupid""

Note yes most of the US Congress voted in favour of moving the embassy. This doesn't really matter - they're still wrong, and previous presidents ever since Clinton were quite sensible to defer acting on the 1995 US bill that required  recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capitol - for the reasons outlined above.

Therefore it is right that Trump gets most of the blame for the most recent action, as he was the first president actually stupid enough to implement the bill. And lets not pretend this was anything other than an attempt to pacify his evangelical christian base, who literally believe that Jerusalem should be under Jewish control because it was a Biblical requirement for the End of Days 🙄 ",2017-12-21 21:43:45

It's really hard not to feel bad for a child who's obviously suffering from PTSD and shellshock. Sorry, we don't have a lot of men that I'm working with and I certainly haven't seen any Ukrainian men who've endured the war, although they do have my utmost sympathy ❤️. The reason is most likely that they can't leave Ukraine. The few men I help from Ukraine were abroad when The war started. I feel badly for them too just not as bad as the people who actually had to go through the war.  My comment is specific to the people I'm working with. Apparently that's a difficult concept to understand. 

So to abundantly clear, I feel badly for any person or animal, regardless of age, race, or gender that's been subjected to war. My comment was simply addressing my personal feelings regarding the women and children I work with.",2023-02-24 13:59:19

I don't believe he would ever attack a member Nation unless he ran out of weaker Nations to conquer.

My point is if he had been successful with the weaker Nations he would have moved on to others. Fortunately given his experience in Ukraine I doubt he would ever attack a member state but who knows. Maybe we haven't seen the full extent of his crazy yet 🤷‍♀️

Edit: I didn't suggest that he would attack a NATO Nation. I doubt that he would and that he possibly would pick on the European Nations if he ran out of non-member Nations to Target.",2023-02-24 14:42:45

11aqt3d,"First of all they literally did pick people up off the streets.✅-> good observation!!!  It was all over the various Russian bloggers I follow... That they had these officials stationed at.... Got the name of what they call these buildings but it's basically a building where everybody rents a room, filled with young students...it's not a dorm. Just cheap housing. Anyway, they'd by those locations and places like hostels, grocery stores, etc.  Then just corner men and force them to the recruitment agencies. There were a significant amount of men picked up illegally in that first mobilization. 

It's BYOB ..which I was going to say BYOE (bring your own equipment) but they also bring booze so it's BYOB and BYOE. 😅.

There's so much corruption in the military. They literally sent soldiers to war with expired rations. They got REALLY sick from expired food.. kind of hard to be fighting a war while suffering from food poisoning...but it helped Ukraine so, yay?. I believe the rumors were that they kept the money for new rations/and or sold them on eBay and left the expired rations stocked. To be fair, nobody actually believed war was coming. Lol. Same things happened to equipment maintenance (part of why tanks did so poorly), and the subpar equipment they bought from the Chinese.

I've really been enjoying Ryan McBeth. I have a military background and he's so amazing. Entertaining, pragmatic, and accurate.

01) This is a usual time for the new conscription wave in Russia (and Ukraine, for that matter).  
02) 134,500 is the number they are aiming for. Doesn't mean they will get as many.  
03) Of course, conscripts will be used as cannon fodder in this war. Everyone inside RF knows this. That's why this conscription period might be tough for RF – see #2  
04) (my personal opinion) Manpower is not the issue for Russia, never was. Fortunately, Ukraine also doesn't lack men and women willing to fight. Equipment and morale will tilt the war one way or the other. NATO, please, send Ukraine heavy guns. We will handle the morale ♥.

I’m not saying he wasn’t any good. I have no idea or really a desire to gauge it but, man. Sometimes people just want a strong man to hold ‘em and say everyone before we’re thrives and everything is better now 🫤🫤.",2022-05-09 14:29:11
