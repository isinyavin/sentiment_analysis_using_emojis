The only piece of mind, is the vet insured us he was completely unaware due to the seizure, so hopefully she was right and he wasn't scared or in pain. 😢 The life expectancy of great Danes..all so we can have a huge dog..it's sad.

A few people joined in with me and I was so passionate that she decided to go with the turtle. I bought all the stuff for his tank,his food,and one time they took him out the water and put him on the floor and he crawled to me and just stayed behind my boot. The first day I didn’t come to school after we got him some idiot put an eraser or something in the tank and he died😭😭I’m 24 and it still hurts lol R.I.P. Gucci 🐢💚",2022-02-07 04:31:01

sm3sdl,Every creature big or small given any love or affection can create tremendous patterns in their behavior.  Has anyone actually ever loved or played with a turtle like a human toddler to see what would happen? Exactly this! All creatures should have a chance to be loved and they all would express the same behavior. It’s amazing what kindness can do.😊,2022-02-07 06:21:32

Another advantage I see is it’s way less likely to collapse. Straight fences are only as strong as their braces. Once the posts go (erosion or rot) they fold quick. And you only need one section to ruin an entire fence.

v235g0,"""You can't wear it though"" 🤣",2022-06-01 01:06:36
v235g0,"As a disabled veteran who's been fighting the VA for full disability the last decade plus, I felt that when he fell over. I don't know his history. But, if it is at all normal or average for that time period, he's struggled in life after coming home. You just can't put a person through that and expect them all to come out as fully functional members of society. Homelessness and suicide are MAJOR problems in the veteran population that I hope we can get a hold on. 1 veteran every 68 mins kills themselves. For every 1 soldier who dies in combat, 22 will die by their own hands.

I understand why. Most of them feel they've been betrayed by their nation. First, there's this idea of not complaining in the military. Honestly, I don't think this comes from a point of machismo or toxic masculinity as I've heard people say. It is because there's a mission that needs to be completed, and they put their personal well being behind that. So, not complaining, even when they should, becomes a habit they need to break when they get out. Here's the part that fucks a lot of veterans up. We suffer and suffer until we finally can't take it anymore and ask for help. But, it falls on deaf ears. So, they complain to congress because no way is this right. After all, we have a contractual obligation with the nation to provide things like healthcare when we're done serving. Again, it falls on deaf ears. They keep trying to get the help, and something like an entire year goes by. Maybe they've had an intake appointment by now, but no real care. Slowly, they realize no one actually gives a fuck, because if they did, we wouldn't be subject to what the VA does. Then, they eat a bullet because they feel like no one cares. 

Personally, I am a veteran army combat medic paratrooper, served 6.5 years before I got hurt so bad in a parachute accident I had to leave. Granted, it was still an Honorable Discharge as I'd completed my original 4 year contract by then. Anyways, I've had multiple concussions, my neck always hurts, I broke my collarbone, I have bilateral labral tears in my hips from the impact of landing 50-60x, I have 2 herniated disks in my lower back, I broke my ankle, and this doesn't include any of the mental health aspects that go with the job I did. Oh, also, one time I landed on glass and almost cut my thumb off and had 40 some sutures done to put it back together. Now, I have lasting nerve damage and tiny shards of glass in my left palm/thumb. The doctor said doing surgery to find and remove the glass would cause more damage than it would most likely fix, and wouldn't recommend.

For all of that, the VA pays me $1650 a month and I live somewhat near Seattle. $550 goes to child support each month, and I try to live on the rest. It isn't cheap to live here, but I'm too poor to move now. Work has been a shit show. I've got ptsd, and makes sleep very difficult to keep on a schedule now. My left hand barely works, my back hurts all the time, I've got a limp and can't lift shit because my hips are blown out before the age of 40, etc. Whenever I write that I have a disability on a job application, no one responds. When I don't disclose that information, I end up getting fired because that stuff gets in the way of me being a decent worker. I wouldn't hire me. Yet, the VA seems to think I can, and need to find a job to make up the huge budget shortfall I have every month.

I'm just ranting now. We treat our veterans like shit though. I'm happy this guy has some financial stability now, because a lot of us never do and end up on the side of the road being spit on. Cuz, you know, we are so lazy and must deserve it. 😑",2022-06-01 01:53:10

v235g0,"Nope. It’s not. Sorry to burst your bubble.

Edit: it’s just a  modern human condition 🤷‍♂️I think everyone does it in some way, there are varying degrees. And just because it’s objects that are cosidered fancy doesn’t  make it any less of a hoarding thing. 

Edit: I had a friend in college who didn’t even realize he inherited hoarding from his mom. He didn’t  even know until I pointed it out.

v235g0,">	first, you missed the part where I said I could understand if it was tied to a specific person or event. Babe Ruth’s glove? Yes, I want that. A plank from the deck of the USS Constitution? I’ll give you a kidney. But something that is a just an unused retail product… makes no sense to me, yes back to individual values, I suppose

The market, writ large, doesn’t give a flying duck about what you, as an individual, value.  There’s one watch.  It only needs one buyer.  The watch is worth what that buyer is willing to pay for it.  

Your understanding about *why* that buyer values this watch at that price is wholly unnecessary.  

But it basically boils down to “more money than time or practical sense.”  The prospective buyer isn’t exactly rummaging for change with which to buy a burrito.  So they have the time and resources to put towards things like this.  

>	Finally, I’m do understand that people value something because it is rare, but why? Perhaps that’s a much deeper question than we have time to really delve into, but my point is that it’s at least difficult to describe why rarity alone imparts additional value to a machine, especially when one can easily obtain another machine that does exactly the same thing. Like, if there was literally only one telescope in history, yea that sucker would be valuable, but there are millions of them.

🎼 I have something that you don’t.  Na na na na na na.

That’s literally it. That is the value of rarity.  It’s as uncomplicated as a thing can be.",2022-06-01 02:25:03
v235g0,"whatever you need to tell yourself, there are varying degrees of hoarding. It’s not always a messy house with newspapers from 1900. But sure you are a  “collector” 😂",2022-06-01 10:50:22
v235g0,"Are you familiar with the word regardless ? That sentence means it doesn’t matter if it’s rolls Royce’s you are hoarding or 25 cent newspapers my dude 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 the emotional investment is all the same because they need to do it 🤷‍♂️

Edit: it’s never about the actual things to begin with genius

Edit: if you have 10 rolls Royce’s why do you need to buy an 11th one ?🤔 can you drive all 11 cars at once ?",2022-06-01 14:23:13

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

Well, I mean, they weren't. The majority of German troops at Normandy were reservists, elderly Germans unfit for frontline battle, juvenile Germans, conscripts from German occupied countries such as Ukraine, Hitler Youth, Soviet PoWs. Basically no one at Normandy had any direct responsibility for the shipping of Jews to camps. 

There was only one proper Wehrmacht infantry division at Normandy, the 352nd. The other two that were present, the 709th Static Infantry Division and the 716th Static Infantry Divisions were composed of the people I listed above.",2022-08-27 12:07:03

i2bo3t,"I had an experimental self-gathered bone marrow transplant in 2017. It was a hell of a ride but I came out the other side. And you will too. When the days get rough, it is okay to get angry, to cry and feel pissed at the world. Bottling that shit up will do you no favors. However it is also okay to make jokes, to wise crack and laugh at your situation, and there is nothing wrong from going from one to the other. It is okay to grieve and feel and make this experience whatever you wamt it to be. Dont let the people around you make you feel bad about your process... And it is also okay to ignore me lol.

j556ba,"This reminds me of my late grandfather (died last year at 99). He was a mechanic for Wildcats and Hellcats on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific theater during WWII. He had a pilot friend (whose name I can't recall) and they stayed in touch for many years after the war. He didn't go to college but he worked as a machinist for several small aircraft companies before being hired by Lockheed (he specialized in creating propellers for planes and later helicopters). They sent him to work at Cape Kennedy under NASA contracts so he got to be a part of the Gemini and Apollo projects.

Your grandfather has been through a lot and has accomplished a lot. Always remember him. 🤗",2020-10-05 00:13:18

j556ba,"Not sure how they did things in WW2. But today Military pilots fly a bunch of different tails (referring to the tail number of the jet which is like its registration) depending on what's ready to fly or what's down for maintenance. 

My assumption is it could be possible he flew that tail number before. Or maybe they actually did assign individual aircraft to individual pilots in WW2, but I kinda doubt that as it decreases pilot readiness, availability and mission capability.

All that being said, some tails may have a pilot's name on the side, along with the crew chief's name. But that pilot may take a different jet that day, just like a crew chief doesn't strictly fix the jet with their name on it.

See also, the lyrics for the song ""I'm a Pilot"" by Dos Gringos. 😂

t4862h,"Putin is a terrorist on a plane threatening to detonate a bomb unless the passengers let him into the cockpit. But if you let him into the cockpit, you WILL die. We all know what happens if we give into terrorist demands or allow appeasement: Their power grows, they become emboldened, and they become less mentally stable.

But we don’t know if he will truly use the bomb. It’s not guaranteed at this point as his military is still somewhat sane. Therefore, we only have one chance at stopping this fascist, and we need to make a stand—united—as the human race and say “NO.”

Regardless what happens next, I am honored to be on the right side of morality along with all of you fellow morons. ❤️ Yes, even you sick bastards who don’t properly use the turn signal before merging on the highway: We’re in this together.

If you're so worried about a nation's right to self defense and choose it's own allies then you ought to write to your government to lift the embargo on Cuba (or if you're in the US like me write to Congress). That is still going on today and stems from pretty much the same reason. 

Small country with an aggressive neighbor and a history of being dominated by said neighbor seeks self defense after being bombed and invaded.

cpaikg,">Texas thinks it’s big. Mate, we are an absolute unit by comparison 🇦🇺

To be fair though, that's comparing a single state to an entire country ([although most of Australia's states are bigger than Texas anyway.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5vomk8/texas_is_not_a_very_large_state_western_australia/)) It does explain why Australians seem to actually grasp the scale of the U.S better than most tourists I've met though, it's a pretty comparable scale.

On a related note, I met a German couple in New York City that thought they could drive to New York, Miami, and L.A. in a week. They seemed a bit crestfallen when I politely explained to them that while it's technically possible, they're gonna spend all their time driving, not sightseeing.

is6s8a,"Don’t get me wrong, chickens are dumb as shit, but I’ll give them the ability of at least learning quickly. We gave raising chickens for eggs a try and they were really scared of us at first....but within a week, as soon as they saw me coming, whether their food container was empty or not, they’d flock over because they’d know half the time I’d have treats (dried bugs that they ate like they were coated in crack)....but they had no reaction if anyone else came over to them, since I was the only one that fed them. Even at the end, the male would be much braver coming forward, while the two hens would usually stand back longer, at the expensive of the male getting most of the treats to himself. To Earth, Wind, and Fire. I apologize that we underestimated how much you would poop and overall cost, so we couldn’t keep you cluckin’. You were all delicious though. RIP. ✌️",2020-09-14 00:40:35

myb64i,"I was watching as the news broke from a newsroom of a British broadcaster. I didn't work in news (worked in an arts department) but I happened to be in the newsroom that day. The atmosphere was just surreal. Silence. Shock. Dread. Doom even. Everyone was busy as fuck working so fast as the stories unfolded but all in an almost eery silence. 
This picture really brings back the astonishment and horror. Just 😢",2021-04-25 20:41:01
myb64i,"Hey, since we're on the topic of 9/11. This has bugged me for a while. It's not a conspiracy theory, it's just I need help understanding how it works.

According to the wife of a passenger aboard United 93, Tom Burnett placed four phone calls to her from the plane. She saw his cellular # on caller ID at least twice:

>Tom Burnett, a passenger on Flight 93, calls his wife Deena Burnett at their home in San Ramon, California. [Longman, 2002, pp. 106-107] **She looks at the caller ID and recognizes the number as being that of his cell phone.** She asks him if he is OK, and he replies: “No, I’m not. I’m on an airplane that’s been hijacked.” He says, “They just knifed a guy,” and adds that this person was a passenger. [Burnett and Giombetti, 2006, pp. 61] (According to journalist and author Jere Longman, this would likely have been Mark Rothenberg in seat 5B; Burnett was assigned seat 4B. Rothenberg is the only first class passenger who does not make a call from the flight. [Longman, 2002, pp. 107] 

(Later, from the summary of an FBI interview describing the 3rd call):

>Approximately five minutes later she received another cell phone call from her husband. **BURNETT was able to determine that her husband was using his own cellular telephone because the caller identification showed his number**, [REDACTED]. 

Interview source: https://kapitalgate.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/2001-09-11-fbi-fd302-deena-lynne-burnett.pdf

However, a 9/11 Commission memorandum states:

>**The call Burnett made from the cell phone did not show up on the cell phone bill,** neither [sic] did the one he placed to his secretary before take-off.

The source is here: https://web.archive.org/web/20130207095711/http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00260.pdf

My question is, how does someone place a phone call to a billable number, only for that call to not show up on their bill? 🤔 The 9/11 Commission, the FBI and Deena all concede that she received at least one cell phone call (Deena says she received 4 cellphone calls, but she actually received 3). So why didn't the confirmed cellphone calls show up on Tom's account? Any answers?",2021-04-25 23:32:33
myb64i,"I am from Brooklyn NY and I was 23 at the time. My first job was working for an office furniture installation company. I remember as a 17-18 year old kid who did many jobs at night and during the summer in WTC 1-2. Being on this higher floors was crazy. I remember on windy days those buildings shaking like they were designed to do. I was in Disney World on my first vacation with my new gf who is now my ex wife. It was our last day there and I was tired from all the walking so I just wanted to stay by the pool and relax. We got up around that time that it happened and for some reason I didn’t turn the tv on we just went to the pool right after waking up. We get there and we here this woman with a sort of British accent tell her friend about buildings collapse in NY. I looked at my gf and shook my head. We went back to the room and put on ESPN and saw the replays. I was in total shock. Thought this was a joke or something. It sounds so stupid but it’s exactly how I was processing this. All of a sudden my gf starts screaming that “my dad works there” and I just said no he doesn’t. Thing was she was in her own state of shock cause her dad moved to 34th & 8th from WTC 1 over 2 years before. I called all over back to NY and every line was either busy or it sounded like off the hook. Finally I got a hold of my sister in law and everyone was safe in my family. Disney didn’t charge us for any phone calls and we checked out and went to her grandmothers house who lived in Orlando. Getting a flight home or a train ticket was impossible. Our only way back to Brooklyn was a greyhound bus. It was 28 hours of pure hell. When we finally got to NJ and we got out to stretch and change drivers for the last leg to the Port Authority the smell of death was terrible. In my yard I had papers all over the place. Seeing all the posters of people missing taped all over my neighborhood Carroll Gardens made me realize that life as I knew it would never be the same. Remembering working in those high floors and thinking what the hell those people endured to this day make me sick. I had a few friends from my old job my neighborhood which is a very tight neighborhood if you know the area and high school who lost their lives. God bless all the people and their families who lost so much.

t1eoio,I'm guessing he didn't expect them to fight back so hard. 🤷,2022-02-26 01:42:56
t1eoio,"True, but a few countries have given Ukraine some pretty effective anti air and anti tank equipment, and I’m sure will keep resupplying covertly, especially if it looks like Ukraine is holding its ground. Invading is always more difficult than defending, and if The Russian people are vocal enough that this war is not wanted, their armed forces will also start to loose their taste and objectivity for this war. A drawn out protracted war is not something the Kremlin could handle. But I firmly agree with you bout countries sitting on their asses while this all goes on.👍",2022-02-25 22:42:38
xkbxe8,"I'm in Tehran right now. Everything is getting uglier by a minute. They weakened Internet bandwidth and speed by alot to they point I have to wait 15 seconds or so for a simple google search result and we hearing gun fire shots. Also they pulled the plug on Whatsapp and Instagram an hour ago and we can only access via VPN.

Those assholes at top of the regime will pay for what they did!

Edit: Thank you for all your support and positive comments🙏🏻. I will do my best to keep you guys updated. Unfortunately the regime cut off Mobile data connections in whole Tehran area so people can't share their protest videos as i write this and I'm using home network as now that is the only way I can connect to internet (and I'm not sure if they pull the plug on that as well). The only positive thing I can say now is that people took control of Tajrish and Valiasr neighborhoods here and set the police cars on fire.


Edit #2: For everyone willing to help please share NetBlocks reports on Iran's Internet stats to everyone you know including news outlets so everyone can know that they are taking citizens basic Human Rights from them and that means things can get even more uglier since they won't be afraid of killing and arresting people like what they did in 2009.

I mean it’s just hair. Hair is composed of Keratin and Biotin. It’s a biological part of a woman. Hair grows and hair falls. Hair turns white as we age. What is the issue with women’s hair? God did not give me a set of organs for nothing. Including skin, which is composed of layers to protect me from the sun and the external stressors. Skin exists to protect the bones. What’s wrong with having hair, skin, muscle and bones? Maybe God should have changed our evolution differently….

I don't mean CIA somehow linked to the protest. But I'm 100% USA have significant intelligence capability when predicting these sort of things 

Armenia lies on Iranian stability in the region since Armenia is part of CSTO and Iran makes friends with Russia which is the head od CSTO (Armenia is a nominal head of CSTO this period)

So it makes total sense US offered their help to Armenia in front of current event if Armenia want to survive as a state between Turkey & Azerbaijan which are strategic partners and foes of Armenia

Note, if you will, the historic makes and models of the cars in the top photograph. “The Big Dig” started planning in 1982, starting digging in 1991, and didn’t finish until 2007. It cost 5 billion dollars more than it was supposed to, and it became such a debacle of a construction project that a weekly satirical newspaper started in Boston called “The Weekly Dig.” Hundreds of construction workers and civil engineers spent their entire career, start to finish, working on just that one project.

Pretty neat thing to get from your grandpa though but this isn’t “literal” scratch therefore not interesting af bcus now it’s “just” a wooden table that came from a tree like all wooden tables do.

So. I’ve to hear from you. Sorry about the phone. I’ve been concerned about you and reached out several times. I was worried that either you had some serious bad shit going on or I had inadvertently done something to alienate you.

Glad it wasn’t that. But losing your phone?  Damn. That really sucks. For me it would be like suffering a stroke or something.  I literally refer to my phone as “peripheral brain”. I’d be lost without it.

xln7mh,"This is incredible. 

As a lifelong popcorn addict, with a burning love for nostalgia, who happens to be a sucker for hard copy media items and has more VHS tapes and DVDs than anyone, but perhaps OP,  who also happens to fucking LOVE home projects …. I just… I just can’t believe it… I just can’t believe that I have gone my whole life and I, just now, realized I that this setup is exactly what I need I my life. 

My mind is on fire thinking about this and I’m so curious about so many things! 
When did you get this idea? 
HOW did you get this idea?
When you started, did you think it was going be made into a little corner or a single room type of set up or did you go into *knowing* you were doing the whole nine right from the jump?
How big is the space? And was it finished at all before starting (walls, floors, ceilings, etc.,)
Was this a solo endeavor or was it contracted out?
Did people think you were a little crazy when you were putting it together?
How did you get your hands on the counters? Flea markets and liquidation sales? 
Are all the movies actually there are do you have some empty cases for decorative purposes only?
DO YOU HAVE A VHS REWINDER? Lololol
What’s the membership fee?
What are the hours of operation?

Seriously though, you already know this but, wowww. THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS FUCKING BRILLIANT … the red manager door, it’s perfect! Exactly how I remembered. The *Adults only* swing doors lolololol THE SECRET DOORWAY ENTRANCE?!?! The section signs and promotional items, myyyy word.. All of it. Every single bit of it. It’s amazing. Absolutely genius. 

I don’t know you, but I wish I knew you. 
This is quite the accomplishment, I hope you’re proud of your work 💛

PS- Kudos to your commitment to the bit.",2022-09-23 06:34:49

Of course we stream at this household, too, I don’t only watch VHS, but this is a creative place to do projects, my kids will know what video stores were kind of like - my family, friends, neighbors love it - and social media has been super fun.

We moved to the South and were able to get something very affordable in an area that was under-developed (it’s now a booming town) but I’ve always wanted a basement to do something creatively-fun that I could share with my family and friends, while also using it as a set to shoot projects; which is understandably lost on some here ~ as they think it’s just a vanity place for me to lie on the floor and do VHS Angels with my tapes 🤣🤷🏻‍♂️

It’s actually really really interesting. You learn that they’re totally disorganized as a group, with “leaders” being of totally different thoughts regarding their Flat Earth theories. You see how they became so disoriented and disillusioned, you see that they are just normal people, and you’ll eventually feel quite bad for them. They’re mostly just smart & decent people who also happen be uneducated & unable to determine what information is reliable. Others are just in it to sell custom-made flat earth models lol. It’s a fun watch! Plus, at the very end, you witness their hearts kinda break as they run a ‘scientific’ experiment to the best of their abilities w/o outside influence... and accidentally rediscover scientific evidence that the Earth is indeed CURVED.",2020-06-07 04:28:37

no97vf,"That’s an interesting point.  I wouldn’t think you would put one in Times Square, and the other in... rural: Afghanistan / Zimbabwe, etc.  I would think you would almost try to put them in two, “similar but different” places — ie find a middle class area of Dallas connecting to a (as similar as possible) middle class area of Florence/Hamburg/Kiev/Istanbul. (I’m literally just showing off had bad I am at geography.)

You’d hate for this to go the opposite way too.  You mentioned poor, But I would say the rich competing against other rich would be worse (than it already is), because IMO they are the ones who could do the real damage.

Ideally I would think the entire project’s goal would be empathy.  You want the commoner in Country A to realize that the commoner in Country B while different, actually has way more in common than you think.  And when Country A wants to go bomb the fuck out of Country B, maybe there’s a little more push back the next time.  🤷‍♂️

qnfer6,"This one is from Boston. ILL FUCKING TELL YOU HOW FUCKING NICE I AM.

I have a story for anyone who wants some insight into living there.

...


One time a man threw a Dunkin' Donuts (obviously) iced coffee full of cream on my wind shield because he wanted to cross route 20 (Which is kind of like a highway in that everyone is going really fast, And nothing like one in that there is no median between the oncoming traffic and stores line the left and right of the road. 

During this time of my life I was in a powerless and angry place.

 I WANTED HIM TO RUE THE DAY HE EVER THREW SHIT AT MY CAR. 🤬

I pulled over because I had to. I couldn't see anything because of all the cream.

I got out of the car and he was walking away! 
I crossed Rt 20, walked up to him and I told him he would not be walking away from me and that he clearly really wanted my attention and now he's got it. 

He was easily like a foot and a half taller than me. He scoffed at me and kept walking. I was INSANE at the time because I was still gripped by whatever demons live inside you when you live and work in the Greater Boston Area. 

So I walked in front of him and slapped him across the face and asked him why he stepped in front of a car like he had a DEATH WISH and threw a coffee at me. 

I ended up telling him I had more regard for his life than he did and what a shitty thing it would have been for me to have hit him and live with killing him for the rest of my life. 

He ended up apologizing and he walked over to the Dunkin' donuts with me so that we could get water and paper towels to clean my car off together.

He started telling me about things going on in his life and I told him about things going on in my life.

A police officer came by and asked if everything was okay. We said that we worked it out. 

He told us.. THIS IS VERBATIM. THIS IS A QUOTE
 ""Stop being a couple-a fuckin' assholes and wasting everybody's time."" 

We agreed that was a good idea and he drove off.

I know it's challenging to have a child with special needs (hell, I'm one!). I promise you that even if it's on a subconscious level, he will understand that his family loves and cares for him. If this bed allows him to be a happy child, then that's worth more than anything else.

Proud of you, Grandpa. Your heart is so big. ❤️",2022-12-15 20:08:59

Awesome that this Grandfather was able to understand his grandson's needs as neurodivergence can sometimes be hard to comprehend as it can be invisible at a glance and seem irrational for us neurotypical folks. Also big respect to your wife for dedicating her life to helping those kids.

I am so jealous of this bed tbh, it looks so cozy and appealing. My current room is in a tiny nook, closed off with blackout curtains, and having such an isolated place to go (with cute soft lighting and a white noise machine and a nice heavy blanket) has been *invaluable* for some of my sensory issues.

Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

EDIT2: as a proof that you no longer need visa:

•	⁠in Ukrainian https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina---ua •	⁠in English https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-en

Edit: this is a copy and paste and I encourage you all to do it too where appropriate!

Шановні українці!

У соцмережах я чув, що поширюються фейкові новини (скоріше за все, підтримувані Росією тролі), що польський кордон закритий.

Це брехня.

Якщо ви шукаєте притулку – йдіть до польського кордону.  Ми готові до вашого приїзду.  На кордоні готові пункти прийому, де ви можете знайти притулок, їжу, медичну та правову допомогу.

Польський уряд запустив спеціальний сайт, щоб допомогти вам: ua.gov.pl

Будь ласка, поділіться цією інформацією, якщо ви знаєте когось, хто зараз шукає допомоги.

РЕДАКТИРОВАТИ: ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНА ВІЗА ДЛЯ ПРОЙДЖЕННЯ ПОЛЬСЬКИМ КОРДОНОМ.  ВСЕ, що ВАМ ПОТРІБНО, - це ПАСПОРТ.  ВІЗИ ПРИСПИНЕНО!  ВОНИ ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНИ НА ЧАС!!!!!!

EDIT2: як доказ того, що вам більше не потрібна віза:

• ⁠українською https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina---ua • ⁠англійською https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-en

i3vkb7,"I get where you're coming from, and I'm so sorry this is happening in your beloved country. I think posts like this help the average person relate to it/understand it more. Usually you see an explosion on screen, then the aftermath, but you don't really see how it affects people in the moment it happens. It's easy to be detached from it when you're not witnessing it as it happens on a human level. This is a stark reminder that it's more than just a big boom and piles of rubble. 😥",2020-08-05 08:57:42

Then I amended my comment to say I was wrong about the colour, as the top half is brown brick. I only thought it was white because the bottom walls are white and civilians rarely ever look up....But this answer STILL doesn't pertain to the Hereford Boat House in any way, just a random rowing club on the banks of the river.

My best project was probably coding a rogue like with procedural dungeon creation (aka nethack), back in 2004.

I was working with a community of like minded programmers for 83+ and 84 who shared asm libraries to push what basic could do. 
I do believe that working within these device limitations pushed me to get creative and push the boundaries as much as possible. A great learning experience!

Yall should come and look around the neighbourhood instead of just the famous attractions, some are really nice and well designed for living well, not just to look rich.

s688ma,"As long as my dog is willingly dependent upon me for food and shelter, there will be behavioral expectations. And if a dog becomes a stray (obviously a position I would do everything to avoid, I'd be quite distraught) then it will be subject to much harsher correction then mine for being too loud or too aggressive by human standards, thanks to animal enforcement.

There's no training period grace for street dogs, no ""she's still learning"" - it's off to a shelter, and hope it's a no-kill. There is kindness in helping dogs understand what is needed to live under one's roof. Everyone who lives here is expected to behave peaceably, not make messes, not antagonize, do their jobs (I think it's usually good if a dog has a few chores, even if they are a little contrived lol.) Otherwise, you can't live here 🤷. No such thing as a (good) relationship that doesn't involve reciprocity.",2022-01-18 14:51:29

Imo your children are a reflection of yourself as the parent(s). If you make excuses for them you’re probably making excuses for yourself. Where else would they learn this from? Except the people they spend the most time with.

On the bright side, at least it’s not your problem. 😌",2022-01-17 22:46:28
s688ma,"My dad told me one time that when I was 3 years old the family had a gathering where I was placed next to my grandma, so that she can feed me right. Something to note before I tell the rest of the story, I was a roudy kid who would hit, kick, and act out. Okay, continuing, I don't know (or remember for that fact) what got into me but my grandma finished feeding me and I just suddenly launched myself and headbutted my grandma right to her gut. At that moment, my father took my hand, smacked it (which made my baby self cry) and said ""no, badly done little man, you just hurt grandma, that's a no go"". As my father told me this, my mother confirmed it and said that the smack to the hand was hard enough to send a good whooping but not hard enough to cause a bruise (perfect, basically) and from that point on my childhood years went with no acting out. I'm pretty sure that tough love straightened me out 😅😅😅, so I would tell others that yeah do it when it is necessary at those young ages, but don't over do it.",2022-01-17 22:04:11

I have told him that. 

His response was: ""those are just dumb western country snowflake laws. In my (small African) country, nobody would give a shit about this""  🤦‍♂️ 

And yet he constantly talks about how successful he would be in the US if only some American girl married him so he could come  to the US legally.  No dude, we don't want your irresponsible ass here (and I say this as a naturalized American).",2022-01-18 01:20:17
s688ma,"Right. Dogs are pack animals and if there's a leadership vacuum they will seek to fill it. 

And I just looked up Alabai. Large shepherd/guardian breed, which means lots of exercise and needing to be told who and how to guard. I love guardian breeds but they can take their jobs a bit too seriously and need strong boundaries. 

Probably need to establish trust first and be gentle but firm. She's been the alpha apparently and needs to relinquish leadership. She will become very loyal if you do it right. Beautiful dogs. I had a large dog and he was the most gentle soul. Intimidating when we went for walks but that was fine by me. 😀 Always trying to run ahead so I was like ""yeah ok let's get rid of your energy"" and we just loved our long walks around the neighborhood. By the end he was nice and tired and then just wanted to nap lol. So let her get rid of her energy first and then do the training when she's relaxed.",2022-01-18 16:42:23
s688ma,"I meant alpha as in he thinks it’s his way or the highway and will happily walk away if he isn’t feeling it. He’ll also do that if I try anything else he wants to “correct” or take his frustration out on. We are working on it but he’s a stubborn thick head (literally and figuratively). It’s easier to explain it as “alpha mentality” than going in to a deep dive on what exactly is happening, especially when explaining why he goes for hands and uses those to communicate with his mouth etc. for non dog behavior enthusiasts, a lot of the behavior is just seen as “aggression” as well so it’s easier to say in one breath he thinks he’s the boss at this stage. 

Btw I don’t subscribe to pack mentality training or anything of the sort but there are dogs who definitely feel more inclined to dictate behavior and try to set their own rules. We are also in the destructive tantrum phase where he is using plastic hard crates as large hamster balls. 😳",2022-01-18 12:38:42

Well, I was about 6 and apparently I spit a little bit when I was talking to him in the truck. So what did the scumbag do? He hocked a loogie in my face.

I told my dad when he got back in the truck…That was the only time I have ever witnessed my dad get violent with somebody. When I told him without hesitation he spit on the the guy and beat the hell out of him right in the parking lot. Needless to say the guy walked home without his beer 😂",2022-01-17 23:00:39

tv9kk6,"I met the last surviving sailor of the second frigate in the hospital two years ago in Auckland. All the others were dead, and he was in treatment for numerous cancers. We spent the night talking, and he hadn't seen his wife for four months -as he didn't want her to see him deteriorating. They had no children; most of the sailors from those two boats didn't either, from Australia or New Zealand. Most of them died of aggressive cancerous tumours too. 

The ANZAC associations representing those men made numerous appeals to the British Navy, British Parliament and British government for financial compensation, most to be used on medical care for their suffering, only to be ignored entirely by the British. 

I lt was another moral Gallipoli for those nations left uncared by Great Britain. 

Shame on the British. -this explains, that's why currently, they are a second-tier European nation with no support from old partnering nations. I hope our nation of New Zealand and Australian soldiers never support Britain again; I certainly wouldn't. 

It's not worth it.

For all those innocent men, victims of military stupidity, may you Rest In Peace. Last We Forget. 🇳🇿🇦🇺

gxbbgf,"> Nope. Factually garbage. 🤷‍♂️ Most black murders arent solved at all and the killer is still out on the loose.. So nope. Not true at all.  

I said if there is sufficient evidence with the implication there is a suspect to bring to court. If you want argue this point we need to discuss conviction and charge rates of suspects which there exists evidence against.  

> Most dead blacks from black on black genocide get not justice.  

Genocide is the intentional and systematic destruction of a group of people. Which organized entity do you believe is behind this genocide?  

If most murders of black people aren't solved by the police wouldn't this be another valid reason for BLM to be out protesting against the police system?  

> George floyd killers are in jail though. Deep deep in jail.   

One ~~exemption~~ exception does not disprove a trend. Also, we don't know if this would've been the case without the overwhelming public outcry that took place.

>Humans have been studying the Moon from afar for thousands of years, but it wasn’t until NASA sent the first people there with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 that its soils could be examined in detail. The Moon rocks the astronauts brought home for laboratory analysis were found to be bone dry – but we now know that those conclusions did not tell the whole story of water on the Moon. Beginning in the early 1990s, a series of orbiter and impactor missions began to piece together a more promising picture, culminating in NASA’s 2009 discovery confirming the presence of subsurface water ice at the lunar South Pole.

ohjw0s,"I'm definitely glad u told me or I would've had the wrong impression of the city!
Sounds like your childhood was interesting in many ways. My moms family is from Brooklyn and my father's is from Queens and I was raised an hour outside the city itself but I always thought of myself as a city girl who just loved nature -to visit... but that changed since I moved to a tiny coastal town in OR, which for me is practically wilderness bc u have to drive thru miles of deeply forested mtn pass to get to here, and then miles of farmland, before you reach ""civilization"" aka where more than 100 ppl live.
I love it.

 It's funny how ppl like us can love 2 such extremely different sort of environments, isnt it?

 I actually dont think I'd feel comfortable living in genuinely isolated rural conditions just bc of the unease I'd feel at night alone and bc of the what ifs. My partner has recently made a career change to FF/ EMS and it's striking how much a difference the ability of first responders to get to you in a timely manner makes a difference of life or death.
I guess that is just one reason ppl say that those u chose life out in the country are so tough and self sufficient.

I think a lot about this stuff bc I recently rekindled a childhood passion for rockhounding and would be much closer to the good stuff if we moved to central OR, which is of course pretty desolate in most places. I want to live a max of 20 mins from town/ grocery, perhaps in a farmhouse on a couple acres with woods nearby. As long as I knew I could reach a neighbors place on foot within 5-10 min I'd probably feel ok, though I'd prefer to be able to just see their lights at night... Just how isolated were you??😳

Would u have any advice for someone deciding to live that way who has no experience with it??😄",2021-07-11 07:53:07

x3xdb1,"Some context from an Argentinian here:

This person CFK (Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner) is under heavy suspicion of having planned and executed the most corrupt government in our history. A federal prosecutor demanded 12 years of prison for her and most of her associates for this. Since then the country has been in turmoil, since CFK is saying that this is all a coup from the right wing capitalists at the USA and other retarded comments like this. Just picture Chavez but female. (for context, she is involved in several dozens of corruption cases, the only one that has gone through showed that ONLY WITH THAT SINGLE CASE CFK stole around 1.000 million dollars in corruption, remember this is only ONE of the dozens of cases she has against her, and also it's the actual ""white"" money, imagine the one they don't declare legally, jesus)

To be honest if the assassination attempt would have been successful it would have been a massive relief for millions of people in Argentina, believe it or not.

For me personally , and probably most of us in Argentina, this is most probably staged. They have been doing a gigantic devaluation and are trying desperately to cover it up in the media with these sort of crap, and are constantly trying to divide the people of Argentina accusing those who are against her corruption of being ""paid"" by the states to go against our freedom (?). After having summoned her army of followers (who most of them are paid to attend), she ordered them to cause riots and mayhem, and while this was happening and every camera was tuned there, they secretly cut fundings for education and disabled people. They are the embodiment of true chaotic evil, hard to believe this people exist. 

Edit: you can check the comments of this post how these people have already been summoned to insult me with no other arguments other than insults. This is what we deal with everyday and this is why we won't be able to get out of the shitty situation we find ourselves in. Apparently I'm a right wing extremist now 😂

And believe me, she is EVIL. A prosecutor appeared on tv on a sunday afternoon stating he had actual documents and proofs that could lead to the arrest of CFK (for covering the responsables of having done one of the worst terrorist bombings in our history) , next morning he was found having committed ""suicide"" at his place. You can Google him as ""Alberto Nisman"" 

One of the personal secretaries of CFK (who was found in a video weighing massive bags of cash which was obviously coming from CFK corruption) became a whistleblower. Shortly after he was found in an abandoned house, tortured and killed. [here](https://youtu.be/QwMMg_EICVY) is a link to the video. Even though those were the secretaries of cfk plus the sons of the main figurehead for cfk, people still believe they weren't corrupt. The video shows that they were stealing so much money that it took them too long to count, so instead they started using scales.

Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia and pretty much the whole region have seen their political compass shift between corrupt right-wing politicians that favor ""the economy™️"" or corrupt left-wing politicians that mention human rights in their speeches.

It's tough to trust a progressive candidate when they'll quickly seek support from previous figures heavily involved in corruption cases. It's like stealing and bending the law is okay as long as they seem like nice people and say that human rights are cool and maybe spend a few bucks on the poor. That's always about it, then it's back to stealing billions. That's why socialism is such a triggering word for so many people around here, with even less acceptance than in the US.

I have high hopes for Gabriel Boric in Chile tho. I think he recognizes the issues of left-wing populism and is trying to push his progressive ideals in a different direction than previous so-called socialists.",2022-09-02 14:18:54

My grandmother also died from glioblastoma, however, I never got to meet her because she died way before I was born, when she was in her early 40s and when my mom was a teenager. My mom ended up having to be more of a caregiver for her and watch her suffer through it. It makes me sad knowing my mom had to witness that, but even more sad I never got to meet my grandmother. Though, at the same time, I know it would have been very challenging to have known her and watched her suffer through that as well. Strangely, I still think about her all the time and just really hope and pray one day there is a cure to glioblastoma. What a terrible disease. 😔",2021-07-11 17:20:16

oi4qoy,"I am so sorry. Chemotherapy and radiation suck! 3 months after my dad was diagnosed with his brain tumor I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. I was 15. It was so chaotic with me and my dad being sick at the same time. I’m not really sure how my mom did it. The Ronald MsDonald house was our second home. Me and my dad both in and out of the hospital getting blood transfusions and platelets. Sometimes me and my dad were just right down the hall from each other. All my memories before and after our cancer’s are blurry, but during that chaos I remember vividly. I’ve been almost 25 years remission and I am so thankful that there has been no reoccurrence. I’ve had thyroid cancer, but that was from the radiation that I got to my neck and chest. Most of the chemo that I received they don’t give to the Hodgkins patients anymore because they were so damaging. I’m sorry about writing a book rather than a comment. Once I start it’s hard for me to stop. I know you probably hear this all the time, but take this cancer day by day and use your community as your resource. I will be praying for you and your family💜",2021-07-12 11:25:30

It’s difficult to explain, but if you’ve ever felt someone staring hard at you before you consciously saw them… if was like that feeling, but way magnified.

Maybe just a transient, idiopathic attack of paranoia affecting individuals and small groups? Sure, that’s totally possible. Maybe even the most likely explanation. Lots of people smoke pot here. 🙂

Or maybe some loci of infrasound, where the narrow canyons leading down to the sea perhaps form standing subsonic waves that affect us on a subconscious level, inducing sensations of unease and paranoia in some spots? Interesting, but seems unlikely.

Apparently a very specific about of energy is required for the various atoms' electrons to do this, and the electrons can only accept photons that exactly match that amount of energy. So most of the photons get reflected, which is what we perceive as color.

khe15u,Underrated comment ☝️,2020-12-21 13:15:58
khe15u,"Lol, Dude.😂
Please point out where exactly I mentioned rural America.

Rural America has several rotten statistics across the board, because the poverty level is very high, and most don't live anywhere Near good quality healthcare or education. They often have more physically demanding jobs, with fewer safety guidelines, and are 20 times more likely to die from accidental injuries. Plus, a large portion of rural America is desert and prairie land, neither of which produces the cleaner air, water, and oxygen I mentioned. Logic should deduce that I was specifically referring to areas that have rain, trees, and running water, since that's what's required for the aforementioned conditions to be present. I Also specified living within a reasonable driving distance of all the amenities.
I've never lived out in the middle of nowhere, nor do I ever Want to.

You dissed my brother's home, in clean, beautiful, and diverse British Columbia, for the sake bars, restaurants, and stadiums, so my original commentary still stands.

As for the crime rates, I did say Big cities vs towns. It would have been more descriptively accurate of me to say Major cities vs small cities, but when you grow up 30 minutes from a major city, all the small cities seem like towns in comparison. Nevertheless, that was an error on my part, and I do apologize for it.

If you look at government crime statistics by city, you'll find that the major cities do have higher crime rates per capita than the small cities.

I've worked and shopped in cities all over the west coast, and I found that the bigger the city, the higher percentage of entitled pricks there are.",2020-12-22 01:52:16

This was in Romania (where I was working at the time) and luckily I had a friend from work who was helping me with everything and IIRC I needed to have a Romanian bank account (? - I can't quite remember), so my colleague gave her bank details and the money went to her and she transferred it to me later.

Would it work with a Revolut account that wasn't specifically created in Romania? Possibly, but I never got that far to be honest.

&#x200B;

Blood from a stone is entirely accurate though. I should also add that a lot of my colleagues were *surprised* that the police were actually able to not only catch the guy and his accomplice but also get my stuff back. My sceptic colleagues hypothesised that it was simply because I was British and the Romanian police were trying to impress (in the bigger picture of Schengen stuff etc.) but I can't vouch for any of that. They generally just distrusted the competency of the police, but hey 🤷‍♂️",2022-07-05 12:32:45

That 90 day lookin good!

From one addict to another dude keep it up. Those first 90 are rough and you're doing so great. It DOES get easier. I am 20 months sober tomorrow and I still get those hard times where I white knuckle the day or week or whatever. But making it through those times is so fulfilling and rewarding. It's now MOSTLY a great time speckled with tough days or times.. instead of the MOSTLY rough with patches of great times that the first 90 gave me. 

If you're in a 12 step program I highly suggest getting a sponsor. They're so valuable to have on your team.

My PMs are always open. Gimme a shout whenever you want my dude!

l0tc0h,"I believe the typical user, or even hard drinker, will be able to use chemicals and quit if wanted or if needed. Sobriety does not become painful for them. For the one truly consumed by the drink, sobriety is the thing that becomes painful, our heads are ransacked by terrible thoughts, we get itchy on the inside (metaphorically speaking), nothing is ever ""good enough"" to fill the void inside until we take that drink, which gives us a bit of comfort, but one is never enough - our bodies crave more until we are blacked out, passed out, in the back of a police car... and so ""the drink takes us"". It truly is a viscous cycle. 87 days is a true miracle, OP, absolutely nothing to scoff at. I hope you've found a sufficient substitute and hope to continue to ""see you on the path"". 🖤",2021-01-20 14:40:56

This is forever a reminder to what I'll be thinking days before the day I was born to two shitty parents.

Maybe if my dad saw this, where his friends went to Vietnam, he went to Korea. I've always felt he was on the good side and the loving side. 
That was when I was younger; now it's Big T with the Trump and I have no idea how that was even possible. 
I'll think about this memorial ever year from now on until I am older and more loving.

That's possibly the most common excuse for inhumanity and also lesser crimes against your fellow man.  ""*If I/we don't do it someone else will.*""

>So whats next? We disband the police? Im sure people would be able to control themselves and not destroy the city in a single weekend. Who needs brutes shooting and suffocating others.

tumhgv,"What to do in a nuclear detonation.

1. Don't look directly at the flash, it will burn your eyes right out your sockets.

2. After initial flash, try to measure the fireball with your thumb, if the fireball is bigger than your thumb, you need to find cover fast.

3. Find a ditch, any ditch, and launch yourself into it, keep you arms and legs locked at your side. And pray to God.

4. The shockwave is extremely powerful, if you lift your head, your neck will snap. If you stand up you will disintegrate. Odds are your already dead.

5. IF.... you survive your main priority, above all else, is finding a building with concrete structure. The thicker the concrete the better. If you find a concrete basement that the safest. Do not drink anything, do not eat anything.

6. Find a radio, any radio and wait for the government to brief you. If the government still stands, they will eventually come for you. 

7. Do not use conditioner. Radiation bonds to it. It's impossible to get out once it's bonded. It's a one way ticket to death.

8. Soap, not even shampoo. Soap is best.

9. Do not leave your base, you've just survived, but there is no guarantee anyone else has. You need to stay put.

10. You've just survived a nuclear holocaust. You will have PTSD, you will have burns, you will be malnourished, you will be alone. And it's theorized that it could take weeks for help to come. Not to mention the fallout afterwards. And I haven't even gotten to nuclear winter. You won't be the same person afterwards and you have a 80% chance of dying from cancer.

It truly is the worst way to die

Edit: who ever awarded me, thank you. It means a lot, if I can help someone with this I've done my job. Much love everyone 🙂❤️

You guys are legends. Thank you so much 🙂

Edit Edit: for the people who need to hear this. You honestly are beautiful people. I'm not doing this to scare anyone. But you deserve to know the truth. And there are people contributing also. Which I seriously think is beautiful. Thanks again my friends 🙂❤️

Edit Edit Edit: for all you trolls that think I'm lying. I studied for 3 years in a army course just to understand the effects of radiation and fallout. I'm by no means a expert and yes I do admit I'm getting a bit rusty with it. It was a while ago. But I'm only trying to help people. Not scare them. Grow up and actually learn something. I'm only trying to help you.

I've never been so hurt. People are actually throwing doubt about my service. Like you would know. I can prove it. Away with you

To clear it up. These people saying ""YoU NeEd MiNImUm 11 YeArs To BeComE Sergeant"" your speaking the biggest amount of bullshit I've ever heard come out of someone's mouth. No you don't. Like I said. I earned it. Ask any soldier about it and they will tell you ""under extreme circumstances a private can be made a lance corporal, then corporal, then Sergeant in the space of 5 years. It's possible. Are any of my brothers here with me. Want to help a brother out? 💙

tumhgv,"Radiation bonds to EVERYTHING, even oxygen. If you were outdoors then there really is no hope. You would be inhaling the particles from the fallout. That's why some people build air filtration systems in their bunkers 🙂

Concrete has filtration. I don't know the specifics but I know if you put enough between you and the radiation you ""should"" be alright (well alright as you could be, you would more than likely already have absorbed a lethal dose). And I'm more on about like skyscrapers or a concrete fortified building. A shelter would HAVE to have a filtration system and they aren't cheap. Very expensive for one that can filter radiation.

When I was in training, we were told that urine on a top wrapped around your mouth and nose would make the radiation bonds to the piss instead of you inhaling it. But even then it should only be done as a last resort. Your better with a gas mask or something that can filter air. Still does nothing about the radiation. Urine is like a bleach, if left long enough on you it can burn. You risk infection etc but it is the safest and fastest method of filtration of air.

Iodine if administered fast enough, can maybe save you. But the odds aren't in your favor.

You need to remember. A nuclear detonation has the same power as a mini sun. You get so much radiation that you can't measure it. Even a tiny blast of light hitting you could be in the hundreds of sieverts. It honestly mind-blowing.

Either way you will still get some sort of radiation sickness. Just depends on how well you have ""avoided it"".

I love your question though. What a thought 🙂

Edit: EVERYONE, EVEN CHILDREN should understand this, commit it to heart. Remember it. Don't forget. I can't stress how important it is to know this. Even with my experiences learning and preparing I would be honestly terrified. Sheer terror. And we are the closest we have ever been to full out nuclear warfare. It's only a matter of time 😟. Hopefully not though. I quite enjoy my life. And I wouldn't ever personally put the planet though something like that. Russia has stopped work on the ISS. that means they don't trust us. We need to prepare.

Edit: for example 1 grey is 20 sieverts. And 1 sieverts is 100 rem. Both are lethal. 100 rem is even lethal in some people.

1 sieverts is 1.000 milliseiverts. Or 1.000.000 nanosieverts. 

Radiation is terrifying

The blast destroys everything at the atomic level. That include you. Them tree would have disintegrated also. The water would be flash burning also.

Realistically. Your not going to be that close. You don't need to be. The main goal of a nuclear bomb IS the radiation. The blast is just a bonus. 🙂

I'm sure it's 50 miles in the new bombs. That's the blast radius. So within that 50 miles, everything would be ash. This is more for a blast outside the radius. But the fallout could travel for hundred of miles. Maybe even thousands.",2022-04-02 18:08:21
tumhgv,Theoretically yes. But lead is SERIOUSLY heavy. You would tire your self out and want to take it off. If you were delirious enough. You would. Then you would die. But I like the idea. Maybe we could have the tech to do that soon enough. Keep hold of that idea 🙂💙,2022-04-02 18:02:27

tumhgv,"The surface would flash burn, your 100% correct. But if you fully submerged and swam down also there is a chance you could survive.

But....... You would have radiation poisoning, the radiation would bond to the water on your skin when you reemerged. You don't win. Well maybe if you had iodine but who the fuck carries iodine with them 🤣🙂

Edit: not to mention the water would still burn you. Just not third degree. You would be in significant pain either way. I would much rather just face my death with dignity than survive and die because I've started melting from the inside out. 

Radiation is the worst way to go. And there isn't a cure for radiation. You would die a very slow, very painful death. I wouldn't wish it on anyone.",2022-04-02 16:58:28
tumhgv,Many did die but I also found it interesting that many people did not leave and have stayed and eaten both plants and animals that grew in the exclusion zone. I don’t think any of them are 100% healthy but while some humans have stayed whats really interesting that the rebound of animals there to the point of thriving. While I’ve done enough research to know I don’t have the money to build a shelter that would keep me alive for 2-4 weeks. My crazy prepper/religious aunt has a years worth of freeze dried food on hand but the house she lives in most certainly would not withstand fallout or being in the blast radius as it’s on stilts. So many variables to deal with that if nuclear war does happen I almost don’t want to survive it. Even if you did you’re most likely to have severe health problems for whatever is left of your life. Humans man 😕,2022-04-02 18:40:46

I’m not sure if CIA is encouraging the mullahs to spend Iranian nation’s money on terrorist in Iraq and Lebanon, send their family to Canada and England, raise the food prices to the space and treating us like shit‼️
Btw from the day that the protests started, food and sanitation products prices went 70 percent high, whereas they are sending thousands of drones and ballistic missiles to Russia so they can murder Ukrainians! We don’t want Ukrainian people blood on our hands!!",2022-10-24 12:47:52

I’m sad you are moving out of your childhood home. I hope you are ok with it. 
We always bought live Christmas trees and planted them after Christmas in holes dug before the ground froze. I especially liked that as a Mom as it meant the tree could only stay in the 3 season room for a short while. 
They made a lovely row of varying pines in graduated sizes. When the children grew up I sold the house.
One child went back for a nostalgic look at the house and… cried for days 🥲

Trees grow from seeds planted in the ground. It's as simple as that.

 It's true. I would still drive by that house and think, ""I grew up there,"" or ""Oh, they cut down that orange tree,"" or whatever but my heart was now wherever my mom was living at *now.*

So, yes. It may be strange and probably sad but I don't think you'll be as bummed out as you imagine you might be.... And now you'll get to see her more often because you'll live closer to each other.

I've always knew that my grandmother loves everything that has to do with gardening. But I never realized how much, till that very day... Only then I understood that my beloved grandma, bless her soul, was the real deal. If you ask me, the concept of #GreenThumbs, clearly, was invented with her in mind... Lol... That day she taught me how to plant a little pit, a date pit with a LOT of LOVE & PATIENCE. And over the years that lil pit will grow and become a (mini) palm tree. I remember being very impatient at first (due to my young age). Later on, I totally forgot all about our tree. Thank God my dear nana didn't... Lol... She took care of it like a good mother takes care of her beloved child. And... Ooops! ""all of a SUDDEN""... 🤣 I just can't remember when exactly, but I guess it took 5-6 years till we saw a ""real"" tree. It was a beautiful mini palm tree. After about 10-15 years we even had our first dates... Sadly, all were unripe no matter what. But we loved our ornamental palm tree nevertheless! It stood in the middle of the garden, like a green balerina. Sadly, my sweetest nana past away a few years ago. She lived with my mom on her last years. Away from her beloved garden. Her beautiful, cozy home was a constant reminder of an event she (we all) wanted to forget. But so many good memories left behind... I think of that tree quite oftenly, but ever since my gradma moved out of the house, I still didn't have the courage to see the palm tree or even just walk into the street. I don't know if the tree is still standing... Maybe it's better for all of us not to know... #TheValueofGoodMemories",2022-09-04 02:46:00

smzksq,"Y'know what's funny? The fact that most of these people in the comments are idiots lol. Everyone is saying things like ""omg why they kill a fish 😭😭😭"" or ""grrrr I hate money 😡"". First off, people are acting so supprised that people are eating the largest animal we can but then forget that that is what every other preditor does. Yes, I do think that we should not be eating endangered species but at the same time what do you expect?

 Then on top of that people are upset at the act of killing the fish itself. And I garentee you that all the people acting surprised at the sight of a dead fish are the same ones who eat chicken, beef, salmon etc. Honestly I prefer wild caught animals because I prefer my animals to not have lived in a sad, depressing state, only being born for a profit. The idea that the reason why my fish died is because it was simply at the wrong place at the wrong time sounds quite a bit better. 

And then the like 300 comments saying ""why you kill such a beautiful creature 😭"" is idiotic. I'm assuming that their just for karma but still, why? Are you suggesting that every living animal isn't a beautiful miracle and proof that there is amazing in our universe? Yea the fish is an apex predator but it's just by simple evolution that it got there. There's a chance it could have been just large prey but it just so happened that eating other creatures was the most sustainable way for it to thrive. And honestly, it doesn't look like anything extraordinary. Just looks like a large fish to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

And I am not saying that we should fish endangered species but I am saying to stop acting like Hippocrates on the internet dude.

I probably didn't make much sense and I'm probably gonna come back and cringe at this in a few years but eh I'm only 13 so idk what to expect. Downvote me to oblivion, I don't rlly care about internet points. I just needed to get my opinion out there.",2022-02-08 00:16:25

Anyway, there is a narrow path along a steep ravine, about a 100 foot drop.  I told him to walk along my right side, away from the ravine.  At some point, he darts over to catch a bug, slips and falls forward into the ravine.  As I'm watching this i see a hand dart out and grab the boy by the back of his jacket and safety put him back on the path.  The boy turns to me and nonchalantly says ""Thanks"".  That's when i realized it was me who grabbed the kid and kept him from falling.  It all happened so fast it was like my body just reacted automatically and I was just a passenger watching everything unfold.  So glad you saved that lady 😀.",2023-05-18 01:22:21

I pause and decide it would be smart to Google if they're poisonous or something? (Platypi have a poisonous barb in their hind legs which for some reason popped in my head) 

Turns out, they carry leprosy and I did not pick that lil bad boy up lol

fsksoe,Pheremones that ants emit and perceive are probably rather volatile and may be secreted in by liquid or gas depending on the species. The antennae up close have a large surface area due to slits and pores in them. Whats cool is that some of these are emitted sequentially ( to determine direction ie: follow the abcabcabc ). Whats even cooler is how gross a termite queen is 😃,2020-04-01 00:51:25

yxp2wn,"I have about 10-20 strains of mids and brickweed I saved from about a decade ago. I would buy an oz or 2 and sometimes my weed man would save the shake just for me and sell an oz of shake filled with seeds for like $50 just cause no1 else would want to buy it.. I told him I saved the seeds so he was happy to hook me up.

 I categorized all the strains by indica or sativa dominance and described the high each strain gave. I still have them all and every now and then grow a few to get a crop of good old fashion mids. I pollinate a bud from the females with the male pollen from the same strain so I have a endless supply. I have some deep gold indica strains and some crazy psychedelic heady sativas all Id guess range between 4-8% thc.

Ive also grown some high thc strains but outdoors on the farm without fertilizing them and I ended up with some nice 10-15% bud that wasnt too overpowering but easily harvested 1.5 lbs off a single supercropped plant.

My uncle bought an old Chevelle that had been in a barn for 50 years and pulled out some weed seeds from the floorboard thats been there since the 70s.. he gave them to me.. Im thinking about sprouting them this spring and hopefully I get a male and a female and can rejuvinate a 50 year old strain 🤞",2022-11-17 15:46:48

tbzdoe,"Before I continue, I’m just going to say the purpose of this comment is to temper expectations for the conflict. While things may seem to be looking one way, new information and an dynamically changing situation may change the narrative; Ukraine may be doing good now, but what about 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years from now if the conflict lasts that long? While optimism is important, it’s also important to manage your expectations and be cautious of things that may be too good to be true.


So why might the Russians seem incompetent so far? As quite a few been saying, it could very well be true that they underestimated the Ukrainians, but there may be other reasons. 
Russian military doctrine may favor sending in outdated equipment and green troops in first to dispose of deadweight in exchange for battle-hardened survivors and intel, which the veteran troops can then use to hit specific targets hard.

There is also the thing where Russian soldiers say they were only there for “training exercises,” but if you were a captured Russian soldier, would you tell the Ukrainians “Oh yeah me and the boys were gonna drive our convoy of 3 T-14s and 7 trucks (with an escort attack helicopter) over to that radio tower 2km down the road and broadcast propaganda all day,” or would you lie and just say you were training?


If anyone wants to correct me or prove me wrong, go ahead, but realistically I don’t think the whole truth of the situation will be revealed until years or decades after the war is done. One narrative I want to believe is that Putin only listened to what he wanted to hear rather than the truth, which is why I stressed that it’s important to manage your expectations so we don’t fall into the same pitfall. Best of luck to Ukraine 🇺🇦!",2022-03-11 22:57:03

They were just trying to protect their land for themselves and what they viewed as something to protect. Imagine signing up for the military, being forced to invade a country, and dying over greed.

b2ro7k,"For what it's worth having worked factory work before, I understand what you were saying and that makes more sense to me than 'its a vague marketing term.'

When you develop a product the cost of production goes down over time. You could effectively produce at a loss for one product line supplementing with other more profitable products while you lower your costs for new technologies.

Makes more sense to me that they would consider a new, high cost, low profit product to be 'bleeding' 🤷‍♂️",2019-03-19 07:25:09

g06nsg,"When i was 12 years old. I had been in an accident and suffered spinal damage. I couldn't play little league anymore. Was depressed. Feeling sorry for myself. Doctors said id rely mostly on a wheelchair, but might be able to use crutches for short durations at home. Then i saw this story on TV. It literally lit a fire in me. I was immensely inspired. I worked out and was quickly ONLY using crutches. Able to support weight on my legs. I got a paper route when everyone said i was unrealistic and couldn't handle it. I carried a full canvas bag full of folded papers through my neighborhood on crutches in the winter through rain and snow. In the summer i mowed lawns. Over time i was able to walk with a cane. It was absolutely because of Terry Fox. His story changed my entire attitude. And my life.  What an amazing human being. 💪",2020-04-13 00:31:37

But i stayed active and walked with cane to keep muscles alive. I use a sports wheelchair at times but wont let myself get too lazy with which is easy to do.  Tell him to at least swim.

1cjgyal,"Dude…. 😢

I lost my childhood cat years back. I got her when I was 10 and I was 27 when she passed.

It’s so hard losing your buddy that’s been with you through so many years. Especially going from being a child to adolescence and then an adult. 

I’m really truly sorry for your loss.  Your cat loved you and vice versa.  Gave the champ the best life it could ask for. 

Cats are best friends when no one is around.  

Also Gandolph is a great name.  Tearing up writing this. I adopted a couple more cats but miss my OG MeMow so much. 

Take best of care.",2024-05-03 22:45:14

1cjgyal,"Gandalf looks so much like my childhood cat, Victoria. Was he also a Himalayan? My cat lived until I was in my 20s as well. We don't know exactly how old she was when we got her bc we rescued her from a situation where someone wasn't taking care of her, but we think she was about 22 when she died. So she had a good long life like Gandalf. 

I know it's so hard to lose a pet, sending you all the good vibes. You'll always cherish the memories with him, it looks like you two had an amazing bond 💓 RIP to sweet Gandalf.

All my cats have been rescues and while i say they were a Maine Coon ragdoll mix, i actually don't know what they were. All i know is they had the best temperament and that they were a hermaphrodite. We called them Hermy. 🥲

xatzw9,It all dependant on conditions also. Bad weather was it a engine out or human  causing it. Engines gone instantly a glider.  I heard pilots that flew gliders and go threw become better powered flight pilots. Feel the wind like a bird. But still it can happen minimize the landings is I guess what ya shooting for be gentle.Im sure towers like and hate pilotes like that 😆 tail wind verses front verses the most tricky sidewind.

Well we can't be ahead of 90% of the nation on EVERYTHING and we already had/have:

* allowing unmarried women to own property(1838)

* being the second state to legalize Interracial Marriage in 1851. 14 states took to at least 1948 to figure that out and another 16 states took to 1967 when the Feds told them to.

* having the first state university in the nation to open its degree programs to women in 1857 with the University of Iowa. Iowa State University would also be coed from the beginning making Iowa the first state to have both flagship public schools be coed. 

* having a married woman acquire real and personal property and hold it in her own right 1860

* second state to outlaw segregated schools in 1868. Took till 1954 for 17 states to have the Feds telling them to stop. 

* Iowan Julia C. Addington became the first woman in the United States to be elected to a public office in 1869. Within a decade, 75% of the county superintendents in Iowa were women, another first in the nation.

* Iowa became the first state to allow women to join the bar in 1869, thus setting the stage for having the first female attorney in the U.S., Arabella Mansfield.

* Ada E. North became the first woman in the United States to be appointed to a statewide office. She was appointed the Iowa State Librarian in 1871. 

* Emma Haddock of Iowa City became the first female in the United States to practice law before a federal court in 1875.

* becoming the third state in the nation to give women the right to vote

* The US Army holding its first officer candidate class for African American men at Ft. Des Moines in 1917

* having high school athletics for girls starting in 1920 with Girl's Basketball which led to [""in 1970, 20 percent of all girls participating in high school sports across the country were in Iowa—quite remarkable, considering Iowa was only 1 percent of the entire U.S. population. By 1976, a few years after the passage of Title IX, that eye-popping 20 percent fell to 5.8 percent.""](https://www.neh.gov/article/when-iowa-girls-basketball-ruled-courts) Title IX was the thing that basically told schools ""hey don't be sexist girls should have sports as well"" Also, Iowa would broadcast the State Title game first in 1955 and would broadcast it into 9 total states. Likewise the title game would regularly be sellout with 16,000 fans in attendance. 

* one of the first black Eagle Scouts in the Boy Scouts of America with Edgar V. Cunningham

* having the oldest purposefully built Mosque in the US(1934) as well as the Muslim National Cemetery, the only exclusively Muslim cemetery in the United States.

* being the only state to defeat a McCarthyistic legislative measure to impose a teacher’s loyalty oath in 1953

* The University of Iowa became one of the first universities in the U.S. to allow a student GLBT group in 1970. It was also one of the first universities in the U.S. to add sexual orientation to its non-discrimination policy.

* becoming the second state to adopt no-fault divorce in 1970.....something England and Wales just did literally.

*  Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, the first legislative act in the U.S. that specifically protected American Indian remains. This act was the predecessor of the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.

* Rich Eychaner, a Republican, became the first openly gay man in the U.S. to run for a voting seat in Congress, running for Iowa’s 4th congressional district in 1984

* Jack Trice Stadium being the only stadium in Division I FBS named for an African American individual which happened in 1997. Jack Trice himself was a football player for Iowa State a good 50 years before most schools in the south would even allow black students.

* becoming the second state to allow full marriage equality for gays and lesbians in 2007",2022-04-06 06:38:11

They were all informed of army marching in from 3 sides.
They were confident that months long protest will bear fruit. They were confident that no government will attack defenseless civilians using army.
They were expecting standard police tear gas.

They were shocked !!!
Army was shocked ......

So it began..... the crackdown ☹️☹️",2021-06-05 01:10:19
nsk4il,"I had to google this- holy shit. If what I looked up was correct, the death toll was between hundreds and thousands, and China is trying to censor that shit on the media because it was a democratic protest. But how tf do you censor 1000+ deaths.

I’m hoping that this somehow leads to China giving their people more rights. This actually kinda makes me wanna protest in China ngl

edit: If they keep on killing their own people it’s going to backfire some way or another. Mass genocide over and over again, killing loved ones, putting soldiers through that, having the word get around, it’s gonna come back to bite you, even if you censor it. The people are going to continue to fight. You kill innocent people over peaceful protests? Okay, let’s take it up a notch! At least I would. How do you think black people got their rights in this country? How do you think trans/lgbt people got rights in this country?

The people are going to be persistent. If this happened in 1989 (if I remember correctly), then it’ll happen again. I do believe the people can make a change, but the people as a WHOLE need to make the change. Once the country sees that the government is slaughtering citizens, something will be done about it. What would ANY government do if 10,000 citizens protested? If hundreds or thousands died, there would be survivors. Word would spread. Even then, 10,000 citizens? You gotta be kidding me. This extreme violence is ridiculous. They were peaceful. Just disband the protest. 

It only starts with one. Once you start killing loved ones, sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, that’s when the real damage occurs and when people will really start to change and turn against you. Keep on killing your citizens. Do it. See how it works out. 🙃

tfrmca,"This might be controversial and I'm only 16 and I haven't seen the world much yet, but couldn't Zelensky just surrender, or at least stop trying to join NATO? If he just gave in to Putin's terms, the war wouldnt break out. If he just surrenders now, innocent people wont have to keep dying. Many people are blaming Putin for this but Putin isnt just to blame. 

Many more wouldnt have to die if Zelensky just freaking surrenders, right? Plus Joe Mama Biden labelled Putin as a war criminal, which is basically a pot calling a kettle black.

Im not saying it isnt Putin's fault, and Im not defending him, but I feel like Zelensky should be responsible and blamed for at least, just at least 40% of the war. I dont see why hes being glorified as a very noble and brave president. He's an actor after all, maybe hes just darn good at convincing the world that hes a noble person.

kudhwi,"My Dad was a part-time Firefighter for a while (UK, 80's). He would be on call when he wasn't on shift down ""the pit"" (local coal mine). He had a beeper that would go off if he was needed and he'd have his shoes on and be literally running down the road to the station in seconds. We lived about 3 minutes from the station at sprinting pace.

He decided he did *not* love, and couldn't continue, the job after a callout that resulted in having to help ambulance crew scrape the remains of two young boys off a mattress after a blaze in a small terraced house. My brother and I were of about the same age at the time, all I remember personally was my Dad not being a fireman anymore, being ""very sad"" for a while, and being paranoid of anything electrical in our house. He went round the house every night and unplugged *everything* before he went to bed.

Only looking back do I now understand how hard that callout must have hit him. You lot have my undying gratitude for what you endure. Put whatever face you want on it, doesn't change what you do. 🧡",2021-01-10 16:13:12

k8gbzn,My grandmother had one as a “pet”. I loved it so much every time I visited I saw him. My grandmother wasn’t a huge fan of animals though and often let him free. He flew away multiple times but always came back. (He slept in a cage but free at day basically all the time) one day though he didn’t come back. I was sad but it was for the best. (I live 2 hours away from that place) so I’m my heart I hope that he went to a place like this ❤️,2020-12-07 16:56:01

this is what happens when architecture and humans take over. they don’t wanna hang out around us anymore. makes me a sad because humans are missing out on so much beauty in the world because we’re replacing it with “technology”. this may seem cool now because technology is relatively new to us, but if we’re around in 1000 years, seeing a pretty bird is gonna be a rare sight that can’t be created or made by humans. maybe i’m being pessimistic but i really get sad thinking about our impact on momma earth",2020-12-07 14:46:04

wsavfn,"Oh you mean ""Jucifer""... that's quite a name.  Selling out not only to the establishment swamp but also his image and now is going the occult route like so many others.  

https://flic.kr/p/2nFhNF5

In looking through his feed...no, he still sold out.   He still thinks what the establishment swamp tells him to and that 45 is the enemy as he echoes the lies from the Corporate bought msm. ""orange man bad!""

https://flic.kr/p/2nFkiFh

https://flic.kr/p/2nFhNFa

I guess I could give him the benefit of the doubt and say it is just that his research skills are terrible.  Unfortunately I really don't think that is the case and I think he has just been weaponized just like many other musicians.  He is pushing establishment propaganda.  We don't even know if 45's name is on the Mar-a-largo affidavit.  Let's see what they find there 😁

He probably also thinks Epstein killed himself, the vaccine is safe and effective, it's OK for IRS agents to have guns but border agents can't, boys can be girls, the WEF really cares about us and The Great Reset is a good idea, etc.

vcz7q5,"One time I was hanging out at my friends house who lived down the road, out in the county. We hung out every day and my parents were chill with his.

Anyways one day us two and our other best friend were just messing around when my friends dad who’s house it was said “Hey kids! I finally got that damn mole out and I need you to set it free in the creek so it doesn’t come back to the main yard.”

We were 12 and absolutely devastated when we saw those little claws just clawing in the water as it sunk straight down 😭

As soon as we realized that we were unintentional hired hitmen to this poor thing and it indeed could NOT swim we all jumped in to save it, but it was too late 😞

The dad started cracking up when we ran back crying it was dead because he really didn’t think we would do it and also he hated moles.",2022-06-15 22:35:31

vcz7q5,"Our cat once sat, for daaaays, above a mole hill. I thought there was no way she was going to catch it.

I was in the garden a few days later, only to see cat running towards me, all excited, with a poor little mole in her mouth. I made her drop it and it's looked fine, if a little shocked. It looked so beautiful with its super soft fur and it's enormous hands. Then, within two nano seconds it dug it's way straight through the turf and was gone, back to its underground abode. Amazing digging speed. Cat and I, couldn't actually believe it. Happily, it was: Mole 1 Kitty kat 0 🐈‍⬛🥰.",2022-06-15 19:59:50

It was stuck on the blacktop, or so I thought, I pass it a little ways and turn around to go help it. When I got back to it, it stuck it's hands straight out and looked like a burrito, it kicked it's foot and shot across the road. Looked like a rolling pin that had gone rogue. 😂 I followed it for a bit and it finally found it's hole and disappeared. Everytime I think about that, I crack up. 

It's like it put itself in 4WD 😂😂😂",2022-06-15 19:52:28

lojd9r,"Life could be common in our galaxy without us detecting it because of a detection filter (I'm borrowing the great filter concept here and applying it to our ability to detect other life).

E.g. perhaps the evolution/advancement of life tends to follow a similar trend to ours, where for eons life makes no outward signs of existence (nothing easily detectable from another solar system such as radio signals, spacecraft, other energy signatures, etc) and then finally, within about a 100 year period of the development of the first technology that leaves ""detectable"" signs of life, they advance rapidly enough to begin space travel. Say perhaps that this advancement curve tends to follow a standard type of pattern universally, which is why ours has, and so naturally others would as well. Then perhaps that standard trend of rapid technological and societal progression naturally leads to where they learn to hide their detectible signature from similarly or less advanced alien civilizations (maybe for fear of alerting a hostile alien civilization which they haven't discovered yet but they realize is possible), or some other reason for eliminating detectable evidence of their existence, such as perhaps they evolve a sense of environmental conservation that includes not polluting space with light, sound, energy, and physical junk, similar to how they treat their own planet environmentally. In this way, their civilization would only have been detectable for a brief window of time, relative to the timeline of the universe, or perhaps not at all, if they develop a way to erase past evidence, or interfere intentionally with others' ability to detect them.

Alternatively, it's possible that the development of super-intelligent artificial life (let's call it SIAL) is an inevitability of the advancement of civilizations, following that standard advancement curve I mentioned earlier. And once SIAL exists, it may be able to travel and colonize the galaxy in ways that organic life cannot, and in doing so does not leave any detectable signs of it.

My theory is that by the time a civilization becomes advanced enough to traverse even its own galaxy, it would be far more sophisticated than us, both technologically and culturally, to the point where we would be to them as chimpanzee civilization is to human civilization: easily observed and even manipulated without any knowledge or understanding of their ability to do so. I think it's quite possible that we have been observed for millennia and we wouldn't have a clue. Hell, we may have been completely manipulated by them this whole time without ever being capable of understanding how or why. Like other life on Earth is today, as us humans change the entire planet in such dramatic ways that thousands of species die off, get displaced from their habitats, are taken into domestication and as livestock, and so on, without having a clue as to how or why or who/what is responsible for it. And part of that could include preventing us from discovering others in some way. We could quite literally be the cattle of some hyper-advanced alien civilization and never know it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(entertainment)

It's pretty much the definition.


>I've always perceived the former as general hijinks and the latter as more of a lifestyle. I have nothing whatsoever to base that on. 🤷‍♂️ 

It's not a lifestyle, it's simply that some people are popular enough drag performers that they play the character as their main job. Once the performance is over they take off the costume.",2023-04-05 17:22:23
12cmtam,"So dressing in drag somehow makes fun of drag? Lmao, yeah I’m sure they just wanted to “make fun of people” 😂 and I’m the delusional one. Okay buddy

Edit: since y’all are so sensitive and emotional, here is an actual source saying men in WW2 did drag for stress relief/fun.

“During World War II, soldiers put on theater performances that consisted of all-male casts. During these performances, select soldiers dressed in drag to impersonate women. These performances helped to boost morale across the army, providing entertainment in an atmosphere of conflict and stress.”

https://shec.ashp.cuny.edu/exhibits/show/lgbtq-military-history/item/2782

https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/drag-entertainment-world-war-ii

Drag performances can be traced to the late 1800s. It’s not a big deal. Relax lol

I’m not sure why you guys are acting like it’s some horrible thing. It’s literally just playing dress up. Relax. The outcome of the war didn’t change because men wore dresses. Lay off the Fox News.",2023-04-05 18:17:45

12gof09,"That fucking sucks man.

I just wanted to let you know, as someone with extensive birth defects in my spine and spinal cord, trauma related injuries to my spine, and inflammatory autoimmune disease - it is the same for the most part in the civilian world with doctors, especially if you've ever admitted to using ANY drugs without prescription for ANYTHING, or recreation.

The pendulum swung WAY OVERBOARD after the pill mill crisis.

Granted it was a bit easy to get them then, but frankly education, harm reduction, legalization, taxation, and regulation should have been the response to drugs in general - but hey what do I know, right?

Anyway, kratom helped me a lot.

That and growing my own opium and whatever other medicinal plants I want.

That's kind of my natural response to mother fuckers giving me stuff like amyltriptaline for chronic pain, or vistaril, or Cymbalta instead of short courses of opioids, steroids, and other legacy ways of treating pain.

You're not alone, and hell I'm sure you're well aware - I know the problem is pretty rampant in the veteran world, but it's also systemic in general.

I mean, fuck, I gotta work 50 hours in a dangerous and toxic environment to even have the capability to PAY MONEY to go get treated for conditions I didn't cause, that are exacerbated by my career, and life in general.

As long as my kids face less challenges and can get medical and dental care... It's worth it, and I'll buck the system while also being a good boy tax payer, contributing to the economy.

That's why I am just trying to buy as much life insurance as I can while young.

 Imagine, every time someone finishes a bomb, plugs in the phone, and then a few minutes later. 💥  Somewhere close our troops see the explosion, rolls up to gather what intel is left, swab up some perps, work the intel, move on, and prevent the next one.
 
 Might only be a temporary fix till they figure out another option, but anything to make it harder for them counts.

o3kjnm,"Gears are technically cams, so the “friction,” is akin to a rolling element, and you want to avoid it with lubrication to prevent sliding. With proper lubrication, tight tolerances and hardened steel “gears,” you’d probably be surprised with how much torque this can handle. I think the limitation is that on the sphere that the tooth “width” is smaller because of the  cross-hatched pattern 

A sphere is actually the ideal shape for hardening,  to prevent warpage. Very cool, but this definitely goes against the KISS mantra. Keep It Simple, Stupid!

sl73eq,"The inability to breathe is also part of sleep paralysis, with or without the apnea too. That's why most people experience something like ""the demon on my chest"" (you can actually google that phrase) that's preventing them from breathing, or the old hag that's basically Force Choking them. Whatever the brain comes up with as the representation of why you can't breathe. Technically we *can* breathe during sleep paralysis but it's shallow breathing with barely any chest rise and fall, because our brains tell the body to limit movement while sleeping, and we don't need as much oxygen while asleep. Sleep paralysis happens when the order of waking up is messed up. Consciousness before brain sends the signal to the body that it can move again. Usually it happens the other way around and we're fully mobile before we're awake.  Maybe you knew all this, but thought it was a good opportunity to share it for anyone reading along. Sleep paralysis is the worst, but knowing about it now, it's less scary than when it happened to me and I had never heard of such a thing 😰",2022-02-05 16:57:42
sl73eq,"Seconding this!! Also a small woman in her 20s (diagnosed around 22 but probably had it for over a decade). There are so many things that can go into it; tonsil size, throat size, uvula size, septal deviations, weight, a million other things (and that's not even getting into central apneas caused by the brain). I really thought the study would show up with nothing, but it turns out I was having over 100 apneas per hour 😂

I'm also throwing my hat in to say it changed my life completely. I didn't realize how tired I really was until I felt rested (and I already felt EXHAUSTED 24/7 - whether I slept 7 hours or 9 or 12, I was equally exhausted and all I talked about was wanting to sleep). CPAP made me understand how other people feel and let me think about things other than sleep. Obviously it has enormous positive effects on health in other ways too, but god, I can't overstate how much it's helped me mentally.",2022-02-05 17:01:49

We shared many of the same symptoms of sleepless and still tired after what we thought was a good night’s sleep. I’m in my mid-thirties and in decent shape. The cpap has been a life changer.

kl14au,"Your Brain Prioritizes ""New"" experiences for recall. This is an evolutionary trait that helps you react to the world around you once you understand something from the benefit of experience.

As you age, you have fewer ""New"" experiences. When you call up things for recall you tend to remember those old ""New"" experiences. 

This is part of why people feel like it takes forever to become an adult and then from adulthood to retirement goes by in a flash. They remember the myriad of childhood experiences they have and less the sameness of adulthood.

So get out there and do new things to slow down your time perception! 😊",2020-12-27 18:00:09

That way you're completely avoiding an overnight stay and also not having an excessively long day in order to fit all the travelling and business into one day without a chance to get decent sleep. 

As someone who has to travel for business sometimes, but despises staying away from home on business I could see the appeal of something like this.

y41z91,"I feel like this is the only time I can ever tell this story on reddit, so I'm going for it because it's related.

About 5ish years ago, my husband and I were on one of the back roads in a residential area on our way to the grocery store. 

We're going under 30mph as there are usually a lot of kids around. I'm in the passenger seat, casually taking in the scenery. We happened to drive past this high school kid who was on the other side of the street, headed in the opposite direction as us. 


 I happened to make eye contact with him. 

You know, I thought it was going to be just a regular interaction where you happen to make a passing glance at a stranger..  Never to be thought of again. 

But, for some reason this didn't happen. 

He didn't break eye contact with me. And because I'm me ( love weird interactions), I didn't break eye contact either. This long haired punk kid was trying to assert his dominance and there was no way I was going to back down. 

So we continued to stare at one another. It became so intense that I took my sunglasses off and as we slowly passed one another ( him on foot, me in the passenger seat of my car) our eye contact remained unbroken. We had to halt at a stop sign and because the interaction was so bizarre and this was now a matter of pride, I refused to be the loser. Never once breaking eye contact with this guy, I took off my seatbelt while we were at the sign and turned around in my seat to directly face this dude. It was so freaking funny to me, the kid also stopped in his tracks and did a 180 (at the same time I was turning around in my seat) and continued to stare me down until we drove off .

I begged and pleaded with my husband to reverse the vehicle so I could reign supreme.

 But because my husband is the logical one, he refused and drove off as he claimed he had no idea what was going on. 

The whole interaction in my head lasted a life time, but in reality it was probably like less than a minute, tops. 😂

I never saw that kid again, but I think about it a lot.

EDIT: For clarification.  I was in my early 20s, the kid had to have been a senior in Highschool. School was not in session.  My ""begging and pleading"" to my husband was a hyperbole and also in jest 😂. To add on, the kid and I were trying not to laugh at one another (you know, when you're trying really hard to keep a straight face). It was all in good fun (in my perspective) and I did not initiate this interaction.  I just thought it was a very amusing moment between a stranger and I having an epic staring contest.",2022-10-14 21:32:05

y41z91,"Lol 😂 so so true. Reading these actually reminded me of a trip to the zoo when I was younger.. maybe Jr. High? Around that age anyway. 

When we got to the gorilla housing, they actually had signs posted saying something to the effect of “please do not stare directly at the gorillas.” So the person I am.. chose to do the exact opposite of the signs. 

I started staring at a big male and holy crap was I scared as fuck when he ran up to the glass and just started hammering the glass with both of his fists. It wasn’t as scary as it should have been for me probably but wow.. it made me rethink some things. I was like “holy shit, guess these zoo people actually know what the deal is 😂.”",2022-10-15 01:37:12

taxojr,"Perhaps stop listening to the news media of both countries to see it for what it is. 

A coordinated attack by United States on Russias economy. 

Putin has been known to, for months, say that NATO had been breaking its promises to keep missile systems out of Ukraine. 

Indian Newspapers report U.S. submarine chased by Russian Warship, which the U.S. denies. Governments are usually full of shit.

Then there’s the claims that there are Neo Nazi units within Ukraine. Even more reports that it was they who started shelling civilians. Who knows if that’s true. 🤷🏽‍♂️

What I do know is that Zelenskyy, who is a known actor, gave civilians AK’s. 

And from my time in the service, I know that civilians that shoot at military convoys, with AK’s usually get slaughtered. 

Any leader that arms, untrained, undisciplined, civilians with AK’s is setting them up to be slaughtered. Dick move. 

But the news…. The news will report it as the military having murdered them in cold blood, when in fact if someone shoots…. Most human beings would shoot back to defend their life if put in that position. 


The reports that the Russian army is “lost”?? 

I believe that they are searching for NATO missiles.  
They’re cruising around civilians with AKs, who’ve been given AK’s and authorization to use them by a leader who didn’t think about what their outcome would be…. Or most likely didn’t GAF. 


America is not the good guy in this. 
Neither is Russia though.

nyu9yo,"Okay I'm going to put this incredibly simply. Vacuums don't suck things. When you feel a vacuum sucking you in, what you're feeling is your body responding to 0 pressure and expanding out into that space as there is no longer a force counteracting your body's high internal pressure. The atmosphere is relatively heavy and clings onto Earth because it has mass, there doesn't need to be anything between the atmosphere and the vacuum because the vacuum isn't sucking up the atmosphere. One thing to further disprove your argument is that the atmosphere is in fact being very very slowly blown away, not by the vacuum but by solar wind. Solar wind is small pieces of debris and high energy particles emitted from the sun which (in basic terms) blow the atmosphere away. Fortunately our atmosphere is mostly protected due to Earth's magnetic field repelling most of these solar winds, but some still get through. Solar winds are the reason planets like Mars which don't have active magnetic fields have very little atmosphere because over billions of years the sun has slowly whittled the atmosphere down.

Someone also mentioned that the magnetic snaps themselves cost, like, nothing (5 bucks for 20 on Amazon, I checked) and could be sewn in pretty easily (did not check), but I hadn’t even considered that most of them probably aren’t made to survive washing.  Based on some cursory research, it looks like all they need is a plastic coating to survive washing, but I don’t expect the $5 for 20 have that.

Overall, I think mag already is the best option in the thread for someone who doesn’t want to go through the hassle of buying plastic-coated magnetic snaps and sewing them in or taking them all to a tailor.

My husband had white blonde hair as a kid that went super dark brown and very curly when he hit high school/puberty. When our kids were small they all had stick straight white blonde hair.  There were a few years when people would look at me with my frizzy red hair, him with his super curly nearly black hair, and our 3 platinum offspring and ask how the two of us had blonde kids.  The kids are older now: 15, 13, and 10 and it appears that they will all follow in their dads brown/curly footsteps. Which was a bit of a bummer for me, I was hoping for a ginger baby. But I'm just going to be content that somewhere 4 generations down the line some random red headed baby will be born and know that was my contribution to the future. 😆",2021-03-22 16:03:04

Not necessarily because no one would have that kind of prejudicial view, but because people would probably assume it’s a nanny situation.

It's practiced all over the world, and even in mainland China it's a minority of people using these goofy ""remedies"". I'm not 100%, but I feel almost certain than any serious respected TCM practitioner would tell you that these remedies actually have nothing to do with modern TCM(which btw is an actual specific practice with schools and degrees and official protocols, not just an acronym for any old Chinese folk remedy). 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽",2020-05-11 10:59:55

They make time for me and I make time for them. We do things together that friends would do, go out to eat, go shopping, get our nails done. I also think because I never tried to discipline them or go behind their back to our parents when they were younger and doing the same wild shit I did, but I also helped guide them, it put alot of trust in our relationship. They called me when they were drunk at a party, or if they were fighting with a friend, they’d call me to come get them or to talk, but I also go to them about things in my life too. We have coffee together a few times a month, and then they also hang out with my teenage daughter and do alot of that for her as well. It just naturally developed into the way it is, but I also think they are pretty cool and not a lot of teenagers would make time for their loser, almost 40 year old sister but they do. They text me all the time and keep me up to date with their lives. It almost feels like there is no age gap when we are together.

For *years* they were seen as any other pair of skeletons found embracing - as lovers buried together. But now that they’ve both been found to be male suddenly anthropologists are working **very** hard to think of any other reason that they were buried hand-in-hand. I especially love this line:

>…nearly impossible, if we consider that in 5th century Italy laws forbade gay sex.

Riiiiiiight, ‘cause gay people stop existing once homosexuality is made illegal.🙄

Or like the grave that [reflected the ideal of Viking male warrior life](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/viking-warrior-woman-archaeology-spd) that turned out to be a woman.

Or the false idea that [men hunted while women gathered](https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/female-hunters/), which goes back to 1960, a time when strict gender rules were being pushed in order to teach women who had found capable skills and freedom during WWII that they needed to “accept their place” as homemakers.

Science isn’t supposed to be about interpreting the world through one person’s schema. It’s supposed to be about finding the truth of who we are and where we fit in the cosmos. It doesn’t matter how much we don’t want to believe the findings.

ukieki,"US has one of the absolute worst prison / criminal Justice systems &  past convict gatekeeping / condescending naval gazing culture in the world, relative to how advanced we are as a country. If you wanted people who mess up once (often times all it takes) to completely and utterly fail and come out 100x worse off after, you would do what we do in the US which I am sad to say…So this is where the other post copied from. This is how most prisoners should be treated - we have a weird culture / ignorant mindset here (in a 1st world country no less) where people not only forget that losing your freedom (and often times losing everything on the outside / having to start over afterwards while basically being put on pause) and treating prisoners like animals as is somehow isn’t punishment enough….🤦‍♂️ It’s pathetically sad that in a justice / prison system (Dept of CORRECTIONS) that was meant to correct, betterment and reform people… was turned into a Dept of punishment and branding people which fyi is the worst thing a community can do for itself.

For all those who want to argue, that’s fine but Save the straw man arguments of bringing up the extremely minute percentage of the worst of the worst, do something to help your own community first like I do as an ada in my everyday life, and maybe most importantly learn to have compassion and give people a little grace sometimes.",2022-05-08 17:29:12

My tech school was 2 of us in 1 room twice the size of this. And then when I got to my first base I had my own room and shared a bathroom with another airmen. I’m much further along in rank now obviously and I have my own house and everything. But deployments are always back to sharing rooms. We had 8 ppl in a room about the size of 3 of these prison cells. And that was pretty spacious in comparison to tents. 

So idk how it is for you guys but for the US it gets better the further along you make it. I’d imagine they didn’t really stress about the comfort of people who are only doing 1 year military service(not that there’s anything wrong with that). And I can see why.

pko1kw,">So a drug addict has a harder time to get their fix

For the record, the crackdown is NOT helping with this. We broke a record last year, 93,000 addicts died from overdoses, way more than during the pill mill days! Because everything is fentanyl now, & taking away the meds they know are real DOES NOT fix the addiction, it sends them into a withdrawal from hell where their only choices are heroin (which is now all fentanyl) or suicide.

The crackdown in 2010 & again in 2015 hurt chronic pain patients AND addicts at the same time. I'm very close to my parents & in-laws who are all chronic pain patients & watching what they go through makes me so angry, but it's not because of the addicts, it's because of bad, short-sighted public policies that end up hurting both groups. Please don't blame the addicts, we are on your side & just want us & chronic pain patients to be treated for our medical issues, with respect and empathy, like human beings!

The way pain patients are being treated is so much more than inhumane & I will fight for them tooth & nail! NOBODY should be taking their lives because the one medicine that gave them their quality of life back was taken from them. This addict is on your side & doesn't do anything to make getting your pills harder (I'm doing my own maintenance/taper because I can't afford help)! 💜 

I'm sorry, I'm very passionate about this issue & worry the people who are responsible for the crackdown want people blaming addicts, instead of demanding they fix their 20 year-long fuck-up that has killed over 1 million people.

I'd like to become an advocate for chronic pain patients & addicts; we have more in common than you'd think, we both have serious medical conditions, & both groups are treated horribly by our medical system & politicians, I think we could make some real progress if we organized together!",2021-09-09 14:41:16
pko1kw,"Yeah, this really rubs me the wrong way...

Hard to put my finger on it. 🤔



When people look at that little cute statue, they see only the pill bottles. You can't even see exactly what pills they were. 

So just, pill bottles, prescribed from a pharmacy. That's the take away. 

I feel like this kind of show is only adding to the stigma of being on medications, period. Not even just opioid medications, not just narcotics, but any medications, period. The idea of seeing a psychiatrist and being dependent on any drugs, even mood stabilizers or anti-depressants, etc. is still very stigmatized.

And yes, if you have to pick up prescriptions at Walgreen's or CVS, then you are dependent on some doctor & some pharmacy. So one can argue that you are technically weaker/more vulnerable, than any human who doesn't need to get prescribed something. 

Then there's this dude...just standing there like, he's so much stronger. He doesn't have to pick up prescription pills at the pharmacy! Come look at him!! Definitely not shameful and condescending. 

^((He kinda looks like someone who thinks I'm getting high on my Suboxone and shouldn't get to participate in NA, etc. 😆)^)",2022-02-20 04:32:37
pko1kw,"Walking along the sidewalk on Portland State University campus and saw a baggy of 30 white pills on the ground. Picked it up, knew they were 10mg Vicodin but still checked out the Pill ID to be sure, as one does, and man, I was stoked. I had been in withdrawal and broke for two days at that point. It was like life wanted me to keep using so I did. 

Or the time I left my city for another to hide out with friends and try to get clean, and decided to drink at night to hopefully help sleep(alcohol honestly makes detox worse) and dunno what had happened but I woke up to my bag of clothes on the ground had definitely been gone through as my shit was everywhere, but what do you know, I find 3 methadone laying in the bottom of my bag. And yep, I kept using at that point too. 

Really will never understand what happened there. Zero idea where they could have came from. I was always so anal about my pills, losing them just didn’t happen, I always knew my count. 🤷🏼‍♂️

Thankfully I’ve been clean 11 years now.",2021-09-09 05:57:11

I have to believe it comes from a place of hurt somehow? Not this guy obviously, but the ppl online who have so many opinions about others treatment. 

Also- omg lmao my first bout with opioids my surgeon did not warn me. it was peak covid in nyc, I was in the ER Bc of my grapefruit sized turds that were hard as a rock. decided I'd suffer after that and tossed the pills, that was more pain than anything I'd experienced 😂😂😂",2021-09-09 04:43:34

I'll give them my last pills when they're being given the run-around by their doctors, I'd rather be in withdrawal than see them in pain, it's crazy it's come to that though. If I hear one more pain patient labeled a ""drug seeker"" I swear...

Your friend's grandmother's story is horrifying. You live long enough to have grandchildren & suddenly you're treated as if you don't deserve even a bearable quality of life. I hope we can create change soon, maybe the more we talk about people like her, the more people will listen & realize this isn't the answer.

I’m so tired of being treated like a criminal.  I have debilitating pain, and even have a spinal stimulator installed that takes care of almost 80% of it on a good day.. but there are days when the breakthrough pain is so bad that I am curled up in a little ball and just want to die.  I do my best to make it through.. but many people I know who are in the same boat that I am in regards to chronic pain, whose pain was managed on a rather low dose of opiates, had their meds cut off cold turkey because of what is going on, as did I… they are currently fighting an overwhelming desire to commit suicide due to the pain and zero quality of life they are now subjected to.  I fortunately found something else that helps me cope, but the suicide rates will continue to go up as managed patients continue to be treated like this.  😞",2021-09-09 06:54:57

Methadone has an insanely long half-life which makes detox way way worse and can last up to a month or even more in extreme cases. 

I’ll take a 5-7 day Oxy or H detox any day over methadone. It’s crazy to me that that is the drug they chose to get people clean.

>What is the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) impact of installing a Solatube Daylighting System?
To answer this question, we first need to understand what wavelengths of radiation are emitted through a Solatube® Daylighting System. Solatube Daylighting Systems utilize two technologies to eliminate ultraviolet (UV) radiation and reduce heat from infrared (IR) wavelengths entering the building interior.

>The first technology is related to the domes. Solatube acrylic outer domes have special UV inhibitors designed to block 100% of UVB (280 to 315 nanometers), 100% UVC (100 to 280 nanometers) and 98.5% UVA (315 to 400 nanometers) rays.

On a related note, when I was a kid I saw *Devil Sticks* for the first time and wanted a pair because once you master it, it looks awesome, bit that's really hard to do.

So my dad being the handy one, decided to make me a set out of wooden dowells and wrapped them in black leather with purple fringe. They took him a while to make, and when he gave them to me, I played with them for like an hour until I realized it took actual skill and training to use them.

This was about 25 years ago and he still busts my balls about it 😂",2020-08-25 13:02:24
ig5h9p,"I’m sick of women only wanting to date me or fetishize me because I’m Jewish

I’m a 22 year old Jewish American man and this has actually been a problem for me since I was like 15 years old. I remember being in school and my friend found out that the popular girls had a bet to see who could ‘fuck the Jewish guyy’ because apparently Jews have huge penises 🙄. It’s hard to explain but I feel like I’m always just seen as ‘Jewish’ not like anything else and it’s just so annoying.

This kind of thing has followed me into adulthood. I can kinda suss out the ladies now that just want me cause I’m Jewish, like I was on tinder for a little bit and girls would message me straight away and start talking about Hanukkah and just general Jewish stuff it’s so annoying. Like preference is fine, if you find Jewish guys attractive there’s nothing wrong with that but please don’t think the only thing you can talk to me about is dreidels and menorahs. Oh and asking if I'm circumcised 😒

But the worst like the actual worst is when girls I think are okay and then I hook up with them and I see they’ve just fetishised me because I’m a Jewish guy. My biggest pet peeve is when a girl tries to do the Jewish tongue kissing thing that they do in France, like they just assume that’s how I want to be kissed because I’m Jewish. Does anyone want to be kissed like that? Or they just assume I’m super submissive from the first time we have sex and go FAR too rough when I haven’t even said if that’s what I’m into.

Sorry for the rant, and I know not ALL girls are like that but I’ve come across so many women that I feel like they just think Jewish are handsome little sex toys with huge cocks and it’s so fucking annoying. If you think you do this to any Jewish men, please remember we are all different and we aren’t all just the ‘fantasy’ that girls have of us. Rant over lol.",2020-08-25 08:35:43

It IS antisemitic to advocate destroying Israel, killing Israelis, killing Jews, suggesting that Israel be held to a different standard than every other nation on earth because it's a Jewish nation, claiming falsely that Israel is committing a ""genocide"" or ""ethnic cleansing"" or implemented apartheid in its society. All of these things are common on social media and at these ""anti-Israel"" rallies/protests--the antisemitism is very real and is everywhere and it's scary and disgusting.

Second, Israel is a de-facto theocracy. The rightist fascists and the religious fanatics go hand in hand and have been for decades. The fascists get their anti-democratic laws approved, the fanatics get to corece and impose their religious believes, and the people who value freedom of thought pay the price. This country has turned Judaism into an ugly totalitarian foundation, everything about religion here besmirches it, unlike the wise and thoughtful way they do it abroad (like in the US).
The fascists here have made being an Israeli shameful. We used to proud of our country, our nation, our flag and symbols. Now these symbolize the cruelty and evil of racist fascism, of appartheid and persecution. I am ashamed to be called an Israeli. I hope to somehow change that :)",2024-04-26 01:33:53

Well, never again. Never in my name. If they wish to hunt down the sick sadistic Hamas fucks who butchered crying babies, raped teenage girls and kidnapped 80+ year olds - I'm all for that. But the appartheid, the sensless mass murdering, the death of over 20 thousand civilians - I refuse to be a part of it.

I believe each of the people, Palestinian and Israeli, have a right to their own sovereign and independent state. However, your words ring true to me. Something feels right along with the inherent caution in my heart (it's hard to not feel like the perpetual victim after being introduced to the Holocaust in kindergarten with the rest of the 5 year olds in Israel).

Source:

https://askinglot.com/is-nutella-killing-the-rainforest

For the click-averse:

An important ingredient of Nutella is palm oil. This is an edible vegetable oil which is derived from the pulp of the fruit of oil palms. Yes, that's right, and estimated is that palm oil kills about an area of 300 football fields of tropical rainforest per hour.

Click to see full answer. 

Subsequently, one may also ask, are orangutans killed for Nutella?

Your Nutella Is Killing Orangutans. Your favourite Italian chocolate-hazelnut spread is suspected to be responsible for the endangerment of Borneo Orangutan monkeys.

Also Know, why is Nutella bad for monkeys? Scientests estimate in 20 years Orangutans will become extinct! Palm oil contributes to deforestation in Borneo and Sumatra, the only two places on Earth where orangutans live. Orangutans are endangered! Nutella contains Palm Oil, by eating this product we are contributuing to hurting the Orangutan species.


 
Additionally, how bad is Nutella for the environment?

Royal blasted Italian company Ferrero, producer of Nutella, for its use of palm oil – a key ingredient in Nutella – saying it leads to deforestation. This devastation leads to the release of carbon into the atmosphere, a key contributor to global warming, Royal said.

Does Nutella cause deforestation?

France's ecology minister, Ségolène Royal, has rankled the company that makes Nutella by urging the public to stop eating its chocolate hazelnut spread, saying it contributes to deforestation. “We have to replant a lot of trees because there is massive deforestation that also leads to global warming.

Let’s leave these awesome forest sages alone 🌳 go with Palm-oil Free and fucking delicious Lindt spread instead:

https://www.lindt.com.au/lindt-hazelnut-spread-200g?___store=en_au

Lindt’s statement:

Do All Lindt & Sprüngli Products Contain Palm Oil?

No - There are many Lindt and Sprüngli products that do NOT contain palm oil. We only use pure cocoa butter as vegetable fat for our chocolate mass, which we produce exclusively in-house at Lindt & Sprüngli. Other vegetable fats, such as coconut oil, palm oil or palm kernel oil are used only for the fillings of certain products.",2020-12-30 22:34:29

This is a single-celled organism in the genus Blepharisma and it is dying. I don't find them in my samples often, they usually have pinkish color and they are photophobic it means when the light levels are increased they will try to swim to the darkened areas. If they are exposed to light or starved, they will lose their pinkish color and will look like this one in the video, also strong light can even kill the colored ones. I don't know why this one died but how it dissolves to nothingness just broke my heart. Big or small, life is fragile. 😔",2021-12-07 04:22:31

And ofc our governments is giving more and more money and Housing, while half of migrants are not working, with the French system that give them money for free. Oh yeah and every single days those ""chances for France"" are throwing Mortars to cops that are not like in the US, just trying to help the poor people that were not able to leave (because all whites and jews left) and trying to stop drug traffic. They also burn cops to death, even when a woman says ""please spare me I have children"" then block them inside the car and throw rocks to that woman/mother.

Well people, that was a little glimpse of a daily life in France 👍 oh yeah a random woman has been killed by a Muslim migrant but well, pretty common here haha 😂

We used to ride in the back of my dad's truck in foldout lawn chairs all over the place. The rents would tell us to keep th pressed against the cab to ""make sure we were safe.""

10vc5jt,Australia is another major source for the CCP to do this as well. They get most of their raw iron for China steel from there. That is far from the point here and you are really just trying to pick my argument apart. I should clarify that the CCP buys property elsewhere than the USA. What would you do with all the money you made off concentration camps full of Uighur Muslims? Canada seems a highly likely target as well. Toronto and Trudeau in particular. They have similar interests and morals or rather lack of. Evidence of this can be seen in the decline of creativity in a culture. Communists love our culture but destroy with their ideology. It’s why our television sucks now too. Did you watch the Grammys? 😂 straight atheism and tons of CCP red.,2023-02-07 03:12:30

However, I also completely understand and empathize with severe alcoholism. I don't think people realize the most lethal drug to stop (yes, alcohol is consider a drug) is indeed... alcohol. More than heroin, cocaine, amphetamines... anything other drug (about tied with benzos). Severe alcoholics are a massive seizure and fatality risk when going cold turkey just for a couple days. 

It's easy to dismiss someone with severe alcoholism and go ""they made that choice"", but who knows their past history that led them to that. I don't excuse it, but I can empathize, seeing it during my clinicals and observation hours in the ER setting before becoming a DPT.",2023-02-06 20:18:38

Taking the skull (flap) out and stitching the skin back down gives generous room to swell. Glad you're progressing well in your recovery man!

1csttbc,"Unhinged mother, deceased father. I was diagnosed with autism; publicly she used the diagnosis for community sympathy, privately she told me the diagnosis didn’t exist and I was just “defiant”. Her priorities were control and “breaking” me into submission. 

I had an older sister who wasn’t abused. Sister went to college, fully funded by deceased dad’s money. Unhinged mother spent the funds left for me by deceased dad on plastic surgery, then informed me my role - forever, for the rest of my life - was to live at home and be her caretaker.

I got a full academic ride to college out of spite, and for survival. 

Unhinged mother found out, kept me locked up in a room for 3 months before college. Literal physical and emotional torture, multiple attempted murders, no access to sunlight/the outdoors/internet/tv/books/games/other people. 

Access to food/water/bathroom was regulated by unhinged mother, depending on how “defiant” (autistic lmao) I’d been. 

I stayed sane using fiber arts and creating escape plans; I’m weirdly good at knitting, crocheting, embroidering, and sewing. Also great at dissociating 🫠

I escaped to college, and after a few rough years got my feet under me. Am happy, relatively healthy considering, and live a pretty normal life now.

My Grandma knew her pretty well before this incident all fell apart and said she was also a little weird. If I remember correctly, she did try to stay in Red Bluff and live out her life normally but the community really didn’t like her all that much. To sum it up based on my own experience, when my Grandma and Great Aunt gossiped about her, they’d talk about how they felt like she was very much aware of everything that was happening and victim blamed herself out of the situation. From what I’ve heard, she believes she did nothing wrong because she confused her sins to God and her husband got the fate he deserves because he didn’t. 🙄 

To answer your question, she might have moved out to Redding or Anderson? Possibly Chico? She didn’t move far.

I suppose Tractor Supply or independently owned hardware stores, and especially commercially focused maritime suppliers might have have way better stuff in their rope selections.

I think I'm going back to the earlier plan of buying a 2019 civic hatchback ex for $22000 because that fits closer to my expected payment.",2020-09-10 20:34:41
ipz90w,"Hmmm you know what I'm not entirely sure. I'm going to do some thinking out loud (or at least in text here so bare with me). 

The amount of energy stored is equal to the area under the stress strain curve, legs assume the nylon is stretched to yield but not above (where material properties become non-linear and deformation becomes plastic (i.e. Permanent, it doesn't spring back)). 

Energy stored is equal to 0.5 x stiffness x deformation^2, meaning deformation contributes to elastic stored energy more heavily than the stiffness. 

Nylon has youngs modulus of 2.7GPa, Steel is about 200GPa from what I recall. 

Nylon yields at about 0.05 strain at 120MPa so assuming 1m length that's 0.05m deformation total energy stored = 3.4e6 J (strain value validated by 120e6/2.7e9)

Steel strain at 120MPa = 120e6/200e9 = 6e-4 

Energy stored = 36e3 J 

So, in conclusion, for the same load applied the Nylon holds more elastic potential energy and therefore is likely to ""snap"" more... probably. I still don't really know but this is the only way I can think to approach this at the moment haha. 

Probably the best thing to do really is then assume all of that is converted into kinetic energy ((1/2)(m)(v^2)) and then use density for m and calculate the velocity? Then you'd have something that KIND of represents velocity per unit volume? I'm not sure how representative that would be but would probably give a good idea of what you're looking for 😊 

Something like rubber is a bit different because of non-linear elastic properties BUT, the whole point in rubber is that it stores a LOT of energy, so I'd imagine in that case there'd be even more ""snapping""

Edit: this is vulnerable to change because it really is thinking out loud and I'm prone to reading through stuff and then deciding that's not the best way to do things haha.

Also, this assumes you're driving a car and loading the specimen to the same value in both cases and then cutting it (or it slipping off a post for example). I suppose what would be more representative would be energy at failure of the nylon/steel",2020-09-10 19:05:13

I know they aren't doing many children in most of these trials, which I understand can be so incredibly hard. I'm a mom of a 14yo son and an 11yo son, I honestly think I'd just be so resentful. We had a cancer scare with my 11yo this summer, and even just that was so hard. I can't imagine your pain. 
I wish your heart healing. Every thing you feel and go through with this is valid, even if societal stipulations says it's not. If you ever want to talk I'm here, always. 
I wish I could do more for you. ❤️ But a big piece of my heart goes out to you and I will spend some time in quiet honoring your boy tonight.",2020-12-27 00:36:09

kkrerj,"Similar process! I had to do chemo (but only a very short round) before this as well. They needed to lower my immune system not get rid of it completely.
What's the prognosis for your condition with this treatment?
If the injection is neulasta (Pegfilgrastim), or something similar (that's what they've given me after chemo treatments and it can make your bones acne pretty badly) see if they will let you take Claritin if it starts to hurt, if you can have that normally. That helped me tremendously every time! Secret chemo patient trick. 😁",2020-12-27 01:27:11

t7jp8a,"I've seen a lot of photos and videos from this war. Lots of horrible, awful, graphic, and tragic things, and I despaired and felt outraged for the people of Ukraine. 

But these are the photos that broke me. I rarely cry, but I couldn't hold it back anymore. To see that mother weeping over that tiny little bundle, his limp body wrapped in the bloodied baby blanket, his little head and hair poking out, saying goodbye to her sweet little baby--the pain and devastation on their faces, it's heartwrenching.💔  This is every mother's worse fear. The pain of losing a child is incomprehensible. A shining little light full of life and promise, snuffed out due to a madmans ego.  

That innocent baby boy was killed by Russian shells during a fucking ""ceasefire"", in a supposed ""safe passage"" zone.  What kind of MONSTERS shell literal infants as they're fleeing during a ceasefire? War is truly worse than hell. At least in hell, there are no innocents. 

Putin needs to get what's coming to him. If anyone knows of ANY possible way an American can help in any way with the war effort or humanitarian aid, please comment or DM me. I want to help but feel powerless to do anything.",2022-03-06 02:01:34

I think we were more shy to be photographed or videoed. You had no editing control, wouldn’t see it til later, and just knew there was a good chance you would “lame” or “fat” (pre body positivity) or something and then you’d be made fun of. 

Now people can take as many photos and videos as they want and edit them or delete them instantly. 

Conversely, we TALKED to each other much more easily. It was not considered rude to start a conversation w people near you even if you’re not with them. It was pretty easy to meet people. Kids these days (I have 3 teens, but people in their early 20s seem to be like this too) often seem way more reluctant to just simply talk to each other. Some will act annoyed or surprised at a basic human hello. They are afraid of being judged in that way or just assume everyone is a threat. It makes me deeply sad honestly. We are a social species … I fear depression (due to loneliness) is going to be a major epidemic in the coming decades.",2022-02-01 18:58:15

“After finally being caught on 15 April 2004, the wether was shorn by a professional in 20 minutes on 28 April. The shearing was broadcast on national television in New Zealand.[3][4] His fleece contained enough wool to make 20 large men's suits, weighing 27 kg (60 lb) – an average Merino fleece weighs around 4.5 kg (10 lb),[5] with exceptional weights up to around 15 kg (33 lb).[6]”

What you can see though, is what they move/interact with.

The waves are quite literally vibrating the camera inside their phone as they film this. You’re not seeing the waves. You’re seeing the impact the waves have on the phone camera.

tagupb,"Watching the video, I feel such a sadness.
It’s just so incredibly sad that this is happening in this day and age…. It’s 2022 how is this still happening?

What really got me was the birds singing. 
And in that moment, I imagined being in that place, imagining whether that was a beautiful last sound to hear if that thing exploded.

And how would that explosion have helped humanity? With peacekeeping? It’s obviously sent to induce fear death destruction etc.

It’s just awful. Devastating. How can humanity still be so primitive?

And to think that an entire nation of Russian people can still allow themselves to be collectively dictated to by one man through fear, by someone with such total power and absolutely no accountability. 

We have seen much bravery in the last few weeks. Every time it makes me proud of the defenders, and sad that I have to be proud of them.

I can’t begin to imagine the hardship that Ukrainian people are experiencing.

Russia: either it’s 💩tin’s war or it’s your war.

Don’t ally yourself to him.

No one wants to invade your country.

Stop enabling that smear on your country’s history to perpetrate such appalling crimes in your name and with the blood of your people.

Stand up for yourselves and be brave! Demand better from your government. We are all just asking you to stop invading another country.

It’s not like we want you to do anything weird. Just go back to russia. 

Really not a massive ask.

Stop the madness.

If this was a radioactive source it’d probably be emitting near visible or visible Cherenkov radiation. 

I’ve handled plenty of uraninite and even the hottest  samples would not be remotely close to an activity threshold high enough to produce these effects. 

We’re talking hundreds of TBq activity or even over a PBq.

The RTG orphan sources from the Lia incident which were warm to the touch and melted snow were roughly 1480TBq. That’s like 1x10^13 more than background 💀. Insta-ARS. You’d need a short lived radioisotope to do that kind of damage in such a small area, not natural uranium.",2023-02-04 12:51:04

Not only that, but he did not enter the reactor hall like the other 3 men (yes 3, Perevozchenko, the man who in the show first warns the control room of the explosion, was with the two interns irl) who all received direct exposure to the radiation at arguable its most lethal stage. Meanwhile Yuvchenko was holding the door open for their return down the hall, and received large radiation burns on his thigh from where he held the rector hall door open. See the reactor door was built specifically to hinder radiation traveling in case of emergency, so his thigh on the inside of the door received radiation similar to the three men in the exposed reactor core. He received skin grafts and was out of the hospital months later, although he didn’t ever truly recover. He required multiple treatments and skin grafts his entire life and I believe died of Leukemia in 2008. So realistically he did die, just 22 years later.

Your Inputs:

Distance from Impact: 10000.00 km ( = 6210.00 miles )

Projectile diameter: 805.00 km ( = 500.00 miles )

Projectile Density: 8000 kg/m3

Impact Velocity: 75000.00 km per second ( = 46600.00 miles per second ) (Your chosen velocity is higher than the maximum for an object orbiting the sun)

Impact Angle: 90 degrees

Target Density: 2500 kg/m3

Target Type: Sedimentary Rock

Energy:

Energy before atmospheric entry: 6.14 x 1036 Joules = 1.47 x 1021 MegaTons TNT

The average interval between impacts of this size is longer than the Earth's age. Such impacts could only occur during the accumulation of the Earth, between 4.5 and 4 billion years ago.

Major Global Changes:

The Earth is completely disrupted by the impact and its debris forms a new asteroid belt orbiting the sun between Venus and Mars.",2021-09-16 06:35:39

t57r4t,">Is CNN good enough?

Actually no it's not, because the link you provided was just an op ed by a random journalist. Hardly representative of the thoughts of any mainstream Democratic politicians. So nope.

>Biden said a lot of random shit in the SOTU... many of which were basically Trump talking points. Securing the border, defending Capitalism and white nationalism in Ukraine, etc.

Ah yes, the strawman argument. Your word salad has absolutely nothing to do with the point that you have no evidence whatsoever of any Democratic leaders or party officials proclaiming inflation is ""good"", which was your original assertion here. Please try and keep up with your own failed arguments.

>An open letter signed by health officials, published by CNN.

Which again, last I checked aren't Democratic leaders, but health officials. Not indicative of ""the left"". Next.

>Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive order

Did you even bother reading the link you provided? It literally says nothing about racism being a ""bigger health crisis than Covid"", which was your assertion. And there is nothing shocking about declaring racism a public health crisis of its own, which is all the executive order stated per your own linked article.

>That's because the Capitol was stormed before Trump's speech ended..... lmao you expect him to be getting live updates on the situation mid-speech and then pausing to tweet about it?? 

No, I expect him not to be inflaming the insurrectionists by telling them during his speech to march to the Capitol and that ""you'll never take back our country with weakness."" And then telling them to ""fight like hell"" and march to the Capitol.

*“We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,”  “So we are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue – I love Pennsylvania Avenue – and we are going to the Capitol.”*

Yeah, look at him encouraging all that peace.

>To be honest, I'm not interested in debating the precise events of Jan 6th, because that would consume too much of my life.

LOL, you're the one who brought up defending Trump and January 6, now you don't want to debate it? Classic right wing bullshit hit and run behavior.

>Eat my ass.

There's no need to interact with you further, you've proven my point about right wingers and gaslighting and with this last comment you've put the rotted cherry on top. Blocked user list updated, buh bye. 👍",2022-03-03 02:10:59

pq0s2w,"Here is my take

You can fight 5 crocodiles

You cant really even fuck with one wild 🐊 

Im not talking gatorworld tourist shit

Talking 13-15 foot FL monsters

Out in the Everglades we have both

But if you have seen enough the average size difference is crazy

Yes crocs are more aggressive but so are chihuahuas

Does not make them more dangerous

Im not even trying for the iambaddassub

But I have in my real life bitch slapped the ever living fuck out of a crocodile in Africa when I was stationed there.

That lil shit hung around after getting metered and became the camp dog",2021-09-17 23:02:13

kmzker,"Your professor was generous in his assessment.
There’s no doubt that Picasso was a masterful artistic genius, but (like many gifted folks) a big part of his style was developed through trial & error - and from sheer effort and volume. 
He wasn’t aiming for precision all of the time, and took many paths that didn’t actually pan out. Total works include:


13,500 paintings

100,000 graphic prints or engravings

34,000 illustrations

+ hundreds of ceramic pieces and sculptures


Roughly two finished pieces a day during his career. I’ll be lucky if I finish two minor tasks today...and guaranteed none will be masterful. 🙄😁

Now the viruses being able to survive after defrosting long enough to make it to a host is very unlikely but transporting pieces of the ice out of the area would increase the likelihood.",2021-03-17 05:34:29

Gar's scales are like armor so a normal hook cannot pierce their skin or get stuck in their mouth like a normal fish. Hell at first i thought i hooked a log because the damn thing was so heavy and not moving. By the time I got it to the boat my dad lifted it in but not before the thing sliced up my dads hand real bad and he was bleeding everywhere.

sz4k90,"I remember watching this as a kid and being mesmerized. Also fun fact, there are identical clocks on opposite sides of the no-man's land in each country and they differ by 30 mins. The guards are friends with each other (except during show time lol), which is not surprising in hindsight but was a shock to me as a kid.

More fun facts, we were posted right on the border on the Indian side, so sometimes PTV (Pakistan's state network) signals would reach over in our antennas. And I would sit and watch their international news segment, which at that time was freaking hilarious. I remember one day the entire international news was that a tractor broke somewhere in China 😂 But their daily soaps were 👌👌

Edit - to add some more context, the time difference is the reason Pakistan celebrates it's independence day on 14th Aug and India celebrates it on 15th Aug, even though both countries were granted independence at the exact same time - at the stroke of the midnight hour.",2022-02-23 04:00:00

People are people, trying to get by. The cars/houses/etc may look different but I’ve been made fun of by the locals while giving it back and we all end up laughing. I’ve had kids run up to me to just wave. I paid for some dudes wedding in Cambodia (it wasn’t expensive)and he started crying and I gave him a big hug.  I’ve had people go out of their way for me in practically everywhere I’ve been.  I love this planet, I just wish it wasn’t so fucked up.

sz4k90,"It's LITERALLY posturing.

I've seen everything from birds to lizards to primates do this, including most of my human friends at some point or another.

It's fascinating as a spectacle; the ultimate dance-off.  It can be obnoxious.  But for all that it does serve a purpose.  It subverts the aggressive impulse in a very real way, preventing violence (or at least putting it off).

When it's individuals who do not know each other well, this ""demonstration of physical fitness"" usually works out; one party realizes they're not going to win, their confidence breaks, and they walk away.  

Not sure that's a great exercise for Nation-States, especially nuclear armed ones.  This is for the birds.

There's a whole Lotta professions I had thought about going into as a youngster, but Drug Interdiction was definitely NOT one of them.
My county had a sheriff who trucked the drugs on the sherriffs helicopter to the giant ranch out west of town, and was so bold, they put a ""temperature gauge"" outside the police station to tell folks how""dry"" it was.
We also had cops involved in targeted assassinations of other cops who tried to turn in the drug running cops, right down to a brother who threw his own brother out of an airplane over the deals ,and his body still hasn't been found 40 years later.

Your brother obviously has balls of titanium to even begin to do that job in Miami Dade.
Because I sure as hell wouldn't, I've known too many cops,federal agents and the like who were fully vested in making sure shipments arrived on time and were distributed via cop parade as a funeral procession and had no problem eliminating other LE who caught on 😳.

oeubti,"Bullshit....both can be trained to perform the same task the same way. Mals just have more of a physical advantage. Which not every situation needs full throttle. This particular drill was just to show the physicality of the mal to try and give a false all around superiority. When realistically the mal was at significant more risk of death or injury by losing his footing, making him vulnerable with no cover. Giving his target time to prepare and counterattack. Granted this was an exercise. The gsd while physically less intimidating, kept control of his footing, used cover raising his chance of survival to keep working. Which it's safe to say both breeds are equally effective based on the skills and techniques they were TRAINED for. Then it's up to the handler as to how the skills,techniques and tactics are applied to a certain situation or scenario. So if these are police k9 hopefully they use both breeds depending on situational needs. If not alot of mals will be injured or killed because of balls to the walls kinda training. So again it's more about training than the difference in breed when it comes to ""working"" dogs. Labradors and poodles( yes poodles are actually unsung badasses) can be trained to do this exact thing. Anyway my enough reddit ramble from me✌",2021-07-06 18:08:37

Always playing the victim ..
You should all know that this is in retaliation for all the dead palestinian children and martyrs everyday . There literally hundreds by now . Israel keeps commiting war crimes and no one bats an eye . 
Israel also uses banned white phosphorus bombs . By logic the resistance cant manufacture that , you can see in other comments how their rockets are made ..
This is not a war ..this is a massacre by israel . Against the palestinian people , hundreds of unarmed people , killed everyday .
Dont believe whatever your media forces on you . Look onto other channels .. 
You should also know theyre hiding the truth from you when israel targeted all broadcasting towers in gaza .
Palestinian people dont have shelters unlike israelis . When they realise a rocket is coming they only pray its not directed at their house . 
Again this is not a (conflict) this is a goddamn massacre .. tons of war crimes commited by the settlers .

Do you also support ISIS and Al-Qaida? Or are you just a fanboy for Hamas?

There are enough thick fucks running around, taking for granted the time we live in, using their free speech to literally constrict progress and damage the very concept of free speech. You need 90% vaccination to achieve herd immunity. We're sadly at least 15% off here in England. I assume it's a higher rate in America, and plenty lower in other countries. 

Modern medicine is a marvel. This vaccine, despite not entirely eradicating the virus, is very clearly keeping a huge proportion of people away from hospitals and death. Even those hospitalised wth covid have a reduced stay time of three days. 

Considering we have only known about this virus for around 2 years, that is an impressive metric.

Edit: This voucher you get, its already your money. You have to pay extra for the container itself and you get it back when you use these recycle stations, so youre not earning money unless you search trash bins and recycle. I dont know how it works in other countries so dont hate me if this is obvious🤣",2021-04-14 22:43:38
mqfy8q,"My first job was at a [redacted]. We didn't have a machine yet so we would count and sort by hand. The worst was when people would bring them in trash bags, because the wash back would dry into a thick sticky syrup and you'd have to reach your hand in there to pull them out. Some people did it without any ppe and bare hand it, I wore dishwashing gloves (Playtex ones you buy from the grocery store, at least the store paid for it..). Some of these people stored them in a trash can until it got full and dump it in a shopping cart and bring it to you.

The worst ones you'd think they just dumped them into a hole they dug into the ground and let their dogs shit on them for a couple weeks before they dug them up and brought them in. I'm kind of joking but it was common for them to be covered in mud, slugs, and on occasion there would be literal feces. We had the right to refuse them if it it was too disgusting but the people who brought these in were asshole alcoholics who would through a fit if you refused one bottle, being a dumb 14 yo making minimum wage (and I didn't grow a spine yet) I just took them. It was easier than getting screamed at by some bum. 

One kid I worked with found used diabetic needles at the bottom of a paper bag a customer brought in. That was fun. 


For some reason, separating plastic, metal, and glass from each other wasn't enough. You had to separate Pepsi products from coke and independent bottlers, Anheuser from other beer distributors, etc. and you would be quizzed on which products belonged to whom.

Suddenly when we got the reverse-vending machines (the official name of these machines) all that sorting went out the window and plastic/cans/brown glass/clear class were good enough. I transfered to another store after we had the machines for three years and learned that we were the only store that separated brown and clear glass. I guess since the machines separated the glass, a manager thought when we dumped the smaller bins into the larger bins we had to do the same. Would have been nice to know for all the times I had a brain fart and dumped a bin into the wrong bin and had to shovel it out.

Hand-sorting was a full time job and I would spend 8 hours a day doing it. When we got the machines, I suddenly had all this extra time and I had to relearn how to look busy as a courtesy clerk lol. That didn't last long.

Can confirm people are the problem. Crack heads putting full bottles in, bottles filled with cigs or chew 🤮. 2-liter bottles with the cap screwed on tight, which the machine couldn't crush so the machine would jam. It was frustrating having to do my normal store work but getting called every five minutes to go out and unjam them or change the bins (plastic will only hold 100 bottles (and the bin would over flow around 75 so you would have to go out there just to shake it down), cans were like 650 I think but no one seemed to have a majority of cans for some reason, and glass were 200 of each color iirc). One employee who didn't have to work on them and should have retired 20 years prior told me, ""If you fix it right the first time, you wouldn't be out there so much!"" and I think that was one of the angriest moments I had in that career that wasn't caused by a customer. 

When I left that job I didn't get sick for over a year.

tl;dr people are gross and suck.",2021-04-14 06:32:39

Cant confirm whether or not they were homeless, but you guys definetly did have a handful of people begging in Stockholm, especially around centralstation and slussen, and every morning Id see people rummaging the trash for those bottles.

Still very low homelessness thougg, compared to other places Ive visited! 😊🇸🇪",2021-04-14 06:47:53

mqfy8q,"Yeah, I absolutely noticed that. None of the people begging seemed to be Swedish. 

Jag också bode i Rumänien för några månader (jag är från Portugal, men emigrerar och resa ofta), och kan säga att de romani personerna i Rumänien är absolut helt annat från de romani personerna i Sverige. I Rumänien de jobbar hård och det är omöjligt att skilja de från resten av befolkningen. Till exempel, en av mina chefer i Rumänien, och jag jobbade för en stor amerikansk företag, var Roma och super super snäll och professionell. Jag var ny i ländet, känt ingen, och hon bjudade mig för en kontor fest hos henne så att jag kunde skaffa vänner.

Så jag förstår inte varför ibland de skapa problemer utomlands, I de andra europeiska länderna.

o2zcmz,"In the last year I started getting spots, I kinda ignored it at first because it didn't seem to cause any issues and it was mostly on my body in places not visible. I'm all fucked up physically so I just figured it was something along those lines and in February I was officially diagnosed. My GP thinks it's due to having a total thyroidectomy, apparently there can be a link between thyroid issues and vitiligo, but I also have other autoimmune shit going on so 🤷🏻‍♀️

It started under my boobs, on my bootyhole (that freaked me out lmao), around my groin and under my armpits. Doc wasn't sure at first if it was a fungus that can kinda look like it, but it's definitively not. In March I started noticing spots on my fingers and on my thighs. I have really light skin so it's hard to see unless you're looking for it, but I've been trying to think of a way to.. idk if decorate is the right word but honor it? I personally think it's really cool and I'm not self-conscious about it at all but I really don't worry about that sort of thing anyway.

All of this is to say I think this is beautiful and I hope to one day have enough go do something amazing like this.

o2zcmz,"Definitely depends on the person. I got it with 5, it spread to about 60% of my body but as I got older it disappeared a little (am 19 now). Compared to all the other comments, mine does still change and it actually changes quite „rapidly“. Last year I noticed a new spot on my inner thigh, which is nearly double the size now haha

I don’t know if it’s due to psychological factors, but I had the same thought as you, when I saw the post. If it spreads it would still look quite cool, but what if it diminishes 👀 that might pose a problem",2021-06-18 23:49:22

o2zcmz,"That makes me so sad 😞 I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone IRL with vitiligo, but have seen a lot of pics of people with the condition and can promise you I have NEVER had the reaction of “ew that’s hideous”. I truly think it’s beautiful and interesting looking (not like: oh look at that interesting specimen, but like: wow look at that persons skin, they look like art!) Same with freckles, tattoos, scars.

Hopefully this comes across the way I meant it to- I have body dysmorphia and know how painful and draining it is to hate certain parts of yourself, particularly ones that are always visible. 

I am 100% confident that you are not hideous in the slightest.",2021-06-19 05:41:02

I thought you were pulling my leg. Until I googled quad pane window... 

For others like me who thought three pane (or two!) was the highest number... 

> What are Quadruple Pane Windows?

> Quadruple Pane Windows, or Quad Glazed Windows, possess four high-performance layers of glass, with three Argon-filled sealed air-spaces in between. With an added pane of glass, they are a solid upgrade over the triple-pane window system in terms of insulation, heat transfer and other aspects as well. Let’s take a look at both the upsides and downsides of quadruple pane glasses in windows.

Oh wow 

Pros of Quad Pane Glass

1. Quadruple pane windows offer better u-values than triple pane windows. To illustrate consider that quad pane windows can be better insulated than a house wall or an insulated garage door.
2. Multi-pane windows like these have effective sound deadening properties. This makes the house quieter by keeping unwanted noise out, creating the perfect distraction-less atmosphere for you to concentrate at home.
3. Prevents condensation on the windows during winter temperatures, keeping the outdoor view crystal clear.

Cons of Quad Pane Glass

1. Due to the requirement of four glass panes, they are naturally more heavy and require tougher, more durable window frames. And as expected, it is harder to install large quadruple glazed windows when required.
2. Quadruple glazing can be twice as expensive as triple glazing but is only able to provide just 20% more↗ thermal resistance.",2022-04-16 10:50:21

u4s7qr,"British insults are great too! I'm not sure how they work but if you put the word, ""absolute"" in front of any other word and say it with a British accent it will instantly transform into a power so great it could leave *anyone* with a stiff upper lip. Examples:

* Absolute handbag
* Absolute shovel
* Absolute utensil
* Absolute stocking

""You absolute stocking"" actually sounds pretty bad, right‽ 😁",2022-04-16 14:43:01

umgzhw,"I love Reddit. The comments from insightful to profane. jokes, types of hamburgers, the purpose of chairs in parking spaces, American football,  'yinz and yinzers, and not one dick or pussy joke, yet, but there was a F''k.  A was down a discussion of how aged he looks. Charles has always looked old. One of those serious, old looking types. Most of the comments do **not** appear to be from Brits,  here's my 2 ¢,  cuz Prince Charles and I are about the same age: Imagine losing your mom to the full time job of Queen of England/UK when you're 4.  Imagine being a sensitive youngster, with a distant Dad a spare the rod type, absent mother, with the general run of nannies, dressing up, schooling, regimentation, etc. and knowing that one day you must be a king. Imagine being sent off to your dad's boarding school, rustic & rough Gordonstoun, there to be made into a man, where your father had been an outstanding athlete and leader, you👌 . Imagine knowing any girl you fancy must pass a sort of trial by fire, produce an heir, and get on with it. Imagine being in the public eye, judged wanting, for Charles has always been a bit of a geek. He might well ask: what is my purpose? Now, after 60 odd yrs, his time could be near. And what does it all mean? I am sure that he is weighed down by both the opportunities and the responsibility.  Besides producing and heir, representing the Queen in various events, Charles has for decades been a fantastic environmentalist, here are a few.

I used to be an actor myself and that saddens me to know that my younger self was also objectified when working hard to be an actress all because I was young and definitely not ugly. So many of you guys can’t ever stop picturing women naked and you struggle to see them as people. A pair of tits is what she worked hard to be to you all, right guys? 🤷‍♀️I’m sure she’d love knowing that’s what yall focused on in a movie about being a strong intelligent woman trying to advance storm chasing technology.",2021-05-04 04:36:39

utq4te,"I am sorry 😞 

Sometimes I sit here and examine my life, and I wonder how it’s possible for me to be so depressed when I’ve had an extremely fortunate life with two very loving parents and no real trauma or anything. We grew up in poverty but we never had to deal with even 1/10th of what most people go through in life. Makes me feel kind of pathetic that I feel this way when I hear stories like yours.

I hope things are going better for you these days.

One thing I’d mention is that it may be beneficial to look into MDMA assisted therapy. From the studies and what I understand is that it’s the most effective treatment for anxiety / PTSD by a significant margin. I believe the statistics show that it had a 70% ish success rate compared to the next leading treatment which was therapy along with daily benzodiazepine medication (Xanax, etc) which only had a 12-15% success rate, and those medications are extremely bad for your health and very physically addictive.

I believe they do 2-3 therapy sessions within the context of several months, and that’s it. You don’t take the drug every day or anything like you would Xanax, just 2-3 times during the sessions, and that’s why it’s a promising treatment option.

The idea behind it is that a lot of people that have anxiety & PTSD cannot discuss their trauma in an open or therapeutic way with the therapist because simply discussing it can cause a lot of pain and anxiety. MDMA takes down those fears and allows individuals to discuss those events in great detail without any pain or anxiety, so therefor you get very good treatment. So it isn’t the drug itself that is responsible for the success in therapy, it’s just the result of being able to openly discuss things with the therapist that you otherwise would not have been able to do.

Anyway, I just thought I’d mention it because from my understanding it is extremely effective compared to the next leading treatment. However I’m not sure if it’s out of clinical trials yet.",2022-05-20 16:52:18

yb3auv,In college I had an anthro professor who explained why we have black squirrels in and around Palo Alto. Apparently some rich dude from back in the day had a bunch a grey squirrels from the east coast imported in for hunting and the crossbred with the native red squirrels which occasionally lead to a dominant genetic mutation that spawned a community of jet black squirrels. 🤷‍♂️,2022-10-23 05:59:28

yb3auv,Answer: get a dog. Preferably a big one. Like a German Shepard. Perks: rodents are scared shitless (literally have seen a raccoon shit themselves when they walked upon my 110lb Shepard sleeping in the yard only to notice him a mere meter away).

There's a saying in Japanese that goes like ""A distance where your soup doesn't get cold"". It means a good amount of distance to live your own life, but close enough to be near your loved ones (and enjoy the soup they made for you).

i am the squirrel, so very small,

i never knew my mom at all...

these human friends - they helped me out ^^;)

(my 'family', i have no doubt)

They're always *close*, i'm never far,

(i know exactly where they are...)

so when i leave my squirrel nest

This the place i like the best!

i come n visit Every day -

the human mom finds time to play

she lets me Climb her like a Tree!

(n Always she

is *Good* to me)

but if,   someday,  i may be gone -

i'll dance 

across 

the grassy lawn . . .

still, in her mind we'll never part -

my squirrel footprints

on her 

heart

wkq44b,"My own father and also my husband are narcissists. Of course, I chose a man who is like my father. 🤷🏻 It is actually not that difficult to live with these people, however, you must know that such a relationship must not contain any emotions. If you recognize the partner you love as a narcissist, you absolutely must break up with him or you will inevitably break down. If you manage to eliminate these emotions and detect and expose every manipulation attempt and refuse to succumb to these manipulations, you can arrive at a relationship based on a certain respect. 

When my husband tells me ""I love you!"" I know that it is only the role I play in his life that he loves and not me as a person! If another person took on that role, he would love that just as much. I could not separate when I realized this because we are extremely intertwined financially. Without being ruined, that can't be resolved for us. So it stayed that way. 

Since then, I have learned a lot about this type of personality disorder and you can come to terms with it. However, I also live my life with minimal regard for him and I really like that. However, coming to terms with this life was hard because he ran and ran up against me for 1 year with all his manipulation skills until he accepted that he wasn't going to get anywhere with it. And I before that I was already struggling with severe depression. The road really wasn't easy and I can't recommend it to anyone. If you can, RUN.",2022-08-10 17:49:15

In my head I was screaming “that’s because you are the villains”. But instead I just smiled and kept pouring $1,500 bottles of wine. I also saw them illegally pay for Manchin’s dinners. And once when only Robert and Heather were left in the room I was cleaning up and I saw him shoving her hand on his dick saying “just touch it”🤮. It made me think that even with her daddy buying her job at the expense of his constituents she still has to deal with that. 
Also one time he said “I never fuck the help” while I was serving food to one of his friends. Then turns and winks and says “well maybe I could make an exception”

If only there was a way for hospital staff to communicate with each other to get around this lack of hive mind. Like a chart or something 🤔 nah, that'd be too much to ask of them. Not like we could ask them to grow the fuck up, take responsibility for their actions, and write important things regarding the patient onto it.

Back then when you can just make a TV show about a great^? grandpa who can break the laws of time/space and spends his time having whacky fun adventures with his (kinda) grandson in their overpowered space ship. They'll have a touching dog episode, a messing with the devil episode, an inter-dimensional TV ""what if"" episode, the one where they go to a planet with only women, and one where they mess with the intergalactic police who are lame dumbasses.

No way they'd have a show like that today. 

To be fair, you have to have a near photographic memory to remember Futurama. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Bender's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - Zoidberg's personal philosophy draws heavily from Carcinos Greek literature, for instance. The fans remember this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of past jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they taught something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Futureama truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Farnsworth's existencial catchphrase ***""Good News, Everyone!""*** which itself is a cryptic reference to Dostoevsky's Russian epic Crime and Punishment I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Matt Groening's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Futurama tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",2022-10-19 05:28:28

l3fodj,"I spent months justifying the purchase of some high-end wire processing equipment for my shop because it would reduce the time it took to make certain wiring harnesses from 13 hours down to about two by cutting the cabling to length and cutting/slitting the jacketing. Tons of research, found different financing sources, determined the ROI based on our current workload.

It was going to make about 75% of the jobs we did drastically more efficient. It wasn't a huge investment at about $65K, but it would have dramatic impacts not only in our efficiency, but in getting our custom work into the R&D department for testing that much sooner. That really matters when some stuff is shipped via ocean cargo. 

Win-win-win! 

Months later, the machinery arrives. I have the least busy guy in the shop unload and unpack it.

That afternoon, we had two giant contracts cancel because of the housing bubble bursting.

The next morning, all of the Department Heads had to pick one person to lay off. We all went with ""last one hired, first one fired"" because there were no bad workers and we were all more family than a business. (PTSD from being in the entertainment industry.) 

We named the machine ""Jeremy"" in his honor. (Don't worry, he was rehired in a few months, went into R&D, and still had a job after they closed my department.)

From that point on, any time someone was being annoying, I'd ask ""Hey, can you go unbox some new equipment?"" 😊",2021-01-23 20:56:53

You still need to get the goods into a pallet, so a sweep table is still required.

In your video those plate style dividers are easier to maintain - although would require much more maintenance than the hex blocks.

Back to the op - sorting products in this style would seem to have limitations on case size, type and I imagine speed.

It would have its uses for other functions - sorting / rejection etc but then I’m not sure if it becomes more expensive than the alternative.

By Michael 👓 Pollan 
Harper's Magazine 📖, April 📅 1 ❗, 1997 💯 

>*Last ♿ season 🙌 was a strange 🤔 one 1️⃣ in my garden 🌻, notable not only for the unseasonably cool 👌🌃 and wet 💦💧 weather—the talk 💬🗣 of gardeners 🌺🌻🌸 all 😤 over 🔁 New 👌 England—but also 👨 for its climate 😤💔😑 of paranoia 👀. One 😄☝ flower 🌷 was the cause 🎗: a tall 👆, breathtaking 😍 poppy 💩, with silky 👘 scarlet 🎏 petals 🌻 and a black ⚫ heart ❤, the growing 🌱 of which, I 👁 discovered 🚬 rather 👉 too late 💤, is a felony 😲 under 😀 state 🇺🇸 and federal 🇺🇸 law ⚖📋. Actually 😳, it’s not quite ✅ as simple 😡 as that. My poppies 💩 were, or became 🚡, felonious 😳; another 🔄 gardener’s might 🔍 or might 🔍 not be. The legality 👩‍⚖️ of growing 🌱👍↕ opium poppies 💩 (whose 🌄 seeds 🌱 are sold 🌫 under ⬇ many 👬 names 📛, including 💨 the breadseed poppy 💩, Papaver paeoniflorum, and, most significantly 📝, Papaver somniferum) is a tangled 💇🏻🖇 issue ⚠, turning 🔄 on 🔛 questions ❓ of nomenclature and epistemology that it took 👫 me the better 🎰📴 part 〽 of the summer ☀ to sort 🔠 out. But 🍑 before ⬅ I 👁 try 😐 to explain 💬, let 🙆 me offer 📴 a friendly 👬 warning ‼ to any gardeners 🌻 who might 🔍 wish ⭐🌠 to continue ⏩ growing 🌱 this spectacular 🌅 annual 🎉🏞: the less ➖ you 👈 know 🤔 about it, the better 👍 off 📴 you 👉🧐 are, in legal 👩‍⚖️👩‍🏫 if not horticultural 😎 terms 📄. Because whether 🌩🌧 or not the opium poppies 💩 in your 👉😀 garden 🌻 are illicit depends 🤔 not on 🔛 what you 👈 do, or even 🌃 intend 🤔 to do, with them but 🍑 very 👌 simply 🔢 on 🔛 what you 👉 know 🤔 about them. Hence 🧐🤔 my warning ‼: if you 👈🏼 have any desire 😍 to grow 💗 opium poppies 💩, you 👉 would be wise 🙌 to stop 🛑 reading 📘 right 👌 now.*",2020-08-13 07:05:51

Maybe the millions that died fighting the nazis would prefer a non-tyrannical Russia, over yet another ""eternal flame"" (Russia built more than 30 of these), that's used to justify invading others and killing them.

Russia kept bombing Syrias cities and villages from the sky and the world refused to provide FSA with any support in fear of the anti-air might go to the terrorists.. the results? All the good guys are gone, and terrorists is what remains..

The conflict in the Ukraine is much simpler. There are just 3 factions involved: Russia, Ukraine and the Nato. It's a full scale war between established industrialized countries. 

On the contrary, everything that happens in the middle east is entangled in a big mess that has been chaotic for decades or even centuries. Civil wars get started by several players of changing alliances for decades. Every time the west got involved it seems to have increased the problems, every time the west did nothing, the suffering continued. When we send support in form of money, it often ends up being used for buying weapons for the next conflict. I'm watching now for 30 years what's happening there and I'm at a loss to decide what could be done about it without making it worse. 

The only thing I am relatively certain of is that the moment we collectively get rid of our dependence on oil, warmongering will become too expensive for the warmongers of today. That includes Putin.",2022-03-04 15:33:53

t6hl2a,This is a good answer. It forced me to look at my own response to Ukraine versus Syria and I think you’re spot on. Things have been so bad for so long in the Middle East that I’ve just sort of… given up on it getting better? The situation with Ukraine is new and with a nation that was doing well being independent and there’s a clear Bad Guy ™ being the aggressor so I think it’s a much more black and white situation. Whereas the Middle East is a lot more nuanced and it’s been going on for a very long time. Compassion fatigue is a very real thing,2022-03-04 17:20:59
t6hl2a,"IMO the only thing that can allow a country to gracefully weather things like revolution is a well educated populace. The middle east will continue to play the Good Revolution™ vs Bad Guy Dictator™ game thinking it will change things, but if it's people can't accept that change and help carry it out it will keep going back to poverty, corruption, and radicalism. It doesn't help that these countries also suffer from brain drain because their brightest tend to leave the country.",2022-03-04 19:03:16
t6hl2a,"> there’s a clear Bad Guy™ being the aggressor so I think it’s a much more black and white situation

mmmmm I think it's just that in the Middle East it's usually us in the Western world that are the Bad Guy™ from an outsider's perspective, so we twist it into a shades-of-grey situation. Or maybe more accurately, there are no truly black-and-white situations but we color them that way depending on our distance from the conflict.",2022-03-04 20:39:32

Oh, but then they found those 90,000 year old bones that proved the two species could and did interbreed.

1. I never said scientist ARE claiming to know things for certain, I only said they “can’t and shouldn’t” say they do. I say this because there are some articles I’ve read and informational television series that I’ve watched, in which they act like it would be incredibly impossible for these things to have existed back then, but yet they did...sssoo...basically I dislike the way ancient civilization’s are portrayed by scientist’s and film makers in these media outlets. I apologize, as it seems I should have taken my time and been more specific. 

2. You’re right, naïve isn’t quite the best word for my demeanor, but neither is “foolish”. I’d go more with ignorant for not phrasing my sentence in the correct manner, but that’s just me. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Still, I think it’s fairly obvious that I was trying to say we are their descendants, which you could have just asked me if that’s what I meant and you would have seemed a little cooler. 

3. Recently they’ve found that a significant portion of the “Sub-Saharan African” population that you claim are not descended from Neanderthal’s actually are...man...this is awkward...seems they hypothesize that 20,000 or so years ago some Europeans decided to migrate back to Africa carrying along with them their Neanderthal DNA. 🤷🏼‍♀️

They put concrete down and then decided to put asphalt over the concrete...idk if it works for other towns, but they recently just closed the road again to completely repave it again. 🤦🏼‍♀️ The only reason I know you shouldn’t do this is because my friends husband owns an asphalt company.🤷🏼‍♀️",2021-05-15 20:02:22

hhd2r0,"Horse shit. 

[here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) Is the WHO’s write up on when what type of mask should be used. If you  scroll down to page 7 of the downloadable PDF, you’ll see that it discusses various conditions under which the gen pop should use masks. It does not expressly state that public in loosely populated areas SHOULD wear masks, and it of course addresses the risk of increased hand to face contact by discussing hygeine and sanitation practices throughout the document, but nowhere, NOWHERE. In the entire document does it disqualify the use of masks due to increased risk of hand to face contact. See the following excerpt (p. 6, Guidance, section 2):

“Many countries have recommended the use of fabric masks/face coverings for the general public. At the present time, the widespread use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence and there are potential benefits and harms to consider (see below).

However, taking into account the available studies evaluating pre- and asymptomatic transmission, a growing compendium of observational evidence on the use of masks by the general public in several countries, individual values and preferences, as well as the difficulty of physical distancing in many contexts, WHO has updated its guidance to advise that to prevent COVID-19 transmission effectively in areas of community transmission, governments should encourage the general public to wear masks in specific situations and settings as part of a comprehensive approach to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission (Table 2)”

It states that that decision should be left up to leaders as to whether they believe their communities should wear masks and in what situations. 

It then Goes on to discuss myriad situations in which it advises that the public DO use masks, the only real outlier situations being those where social distancing is an easy alternative (See Table 2). We can ascertain from the WHO’s position that the public should use masks in multiples scenarios, that it does not disqualify them as a risk mitigator based on increased hand to face contact, as you are suggesting. 

Your informations is at best, outdated, and therefore it is worthless, or at worst, willfully misrepresented, in which case YOU are worthless.

mul3p9,"Wait really? I always thought Americans had stuff on their mantelpiece like a whale's penis bone (baculum), and the head of a bear on a sort of wooden frame and the beard's head is sticking out. Same thing with deer heads, especially ones with antlers.
  
Is this not a common thing in America then? I thought you guys all went hunting and killed deer and wild hogs for their meat and so on, and then you also keep their heads for displaying on the wall, as some kind of conversation piece for when you have a dinner party. Is that kinda thing only in texas and places with a similar culture and attitude toward guns? I know there's Texans like Stone Cold Steve Austin, and HBK Shawn Michaels. They're both from texas, and I believe they both have their own TV shows that is all about hunting, they go round being filmed while shooting at shit. I know HBK specifically is very into hunting. He kinda does it as a hobby to take up his time, so that he never falls of the wagon again and start doing drugs again. Like how Alice Cooper plays golf as a way to stay off drugs. But I dunno, it just kinda makes no sense to me, cos HBK also used jesus tk get off drugs, he's a major born again Christian now, but then he goes round shooting innocent deer? Doesn't make sense to me. But then I come from a country where the vast majority of people are atheist (69% are atheist, nice😎). So I don't really understand America's obessesion with religion and how they have celebrity preachers, seems like it's completely against what the Bible says it you have your own personal aeroplane and are a multi millionaire and you do your sermons in a literal stadium. It's bizarre 


Anyway, yeah what kind of punishment would be in store for owning a whale penis?
   
And I don't think you're correct about the law. Because if it's really true that nobody is allowed to have ANY part of a marine mammal, then explain perfume. All Perfume has whale in it. Well maybe there exists some vegan perfume. But normal perfume generally has parts of a whale in it. So you see, if it were true, then how are people allowed to own perfume? I'm genuinely asking, I'm not trolling or something, it's just you said owning ANY part of a marine mammal is illegal. And perfume has whale in it, for some reason. It's called ambergris. It comes from sperm whales mainly.",2021-04-20 12:58:07

Russian protests. Public service announcement.

Copy/paste:

I am a Russian student from Moscow. Help me spread the information about protests location and time EVERYWHERE. If we, Russians, do it on social media, we now face up to a 15.000$ fee and 3-15 years in prison if the government traces us. Independent newsletters are being trashed right now by the police, we go undercover on Signal and Telegram (Team Navalniy channel t.me/teamnavalny) and share news from there, but it is not enough to reach out to the amount of people we need. Facebook and many websites are banned. BBC is banned, but with go air on short radio waves. We need YOU ALL. Help us spread the word!

‼‼‼

19.00  WEEKDAYS

14.00 WEEKENDS

⚡The main protest is this Sunday 14.00⚡

EVERYBODY JOIN US!

🌻🌻🌻

Я русская студентка, учусь в Москве. Помогите как можно скорее ВЕЗДЕ распространить информацию о митингах: время и место старта демонстраций. Когда эта информация исходит от нас, мы находимся под ударом: штрафы до 1.500.000 рублей и тюремное заключение 3-15 лет. Независимые каналы новостных сводок прямо сейчас подвергаются обыскам, мы ушли в подполье на платформах Сигнал и Телеграм (канал Команда Навального t.me/teamnavalny), но этого не достаточно, нужен больший охват, большая аудитория. Фейсбук и многие сайты подвергнуты блокировке. BBC и новости с запада тоже ограничены. Оппозиции нужны новые силы. Кто-то, как ВВС, будет вещать на коротковолновом радио. Но нам нужны ВЫ ВСЕ. Помогите распространить информацию!

Canada has 1369 McDonald's, and 38 million people! That's 1 McDonald's per 27,757 people.

Russia, you have 144 million people and only 800 McDonald's!? That's a pathetic 1 McDonald's per 180K people.

Get your shit together, Russia. You have vast wastelands and a shitload of people. That's the two ingredients necessary for McDonald's to breed and spread fast af like Baptist rabbits.

You know what else? USA and Canada both have higher life expectancy tban Russia. So in conclusion, countries with a McDonald's to People ratio greater than 1/20,000 are are significantly healthier and less likely to invade Ukraine. Thank you for your time 🙏",2022-03-09 04:58:54

I’ve looked into that theory, and although quite entertaining, I can’t get behind it completely. 

For instance, consider this: Do you think Mowgli could have learned to talk and “evolve” if he took psychedelics at any point in his life (young or old)? Do you think he could lead another feral human to take psychedelics and collectively evolve?

Even if it were many small changes over a long period of time, then psychedelics would be embedded all over our society as it would be the most impactful thing ever to have happened. But instead psychedelics is a niche practice of enlightenment compared to all the other forms like religion, education, mentoring, parenting, etc.

kqh4ym,"It's true. Nurse here. I've done compression on many people but one frail man in particular sticks with me. An AED, between shocks, prompts you which includes ""start/resume CPR"", ""good compressions"" or ""push harder"". My maintenance of ""good"" compressions crushed his rib cage. His whole chest was no longer chest shape but at my job we legally cannot stop CPR once started unless someone (MD or medic) pronounces the death. Some time into the event I felt a ""GUSH"" and the other nurses standing around heard it. Not sure if I ruptured a fluid filled lung or busted his heart, but that was what a ""good"" compression takes. Unfortunately in the absence of the ribcage, its a brutal mess. 

Moral of the story... if you have a family member that is quite elderly and/or in poor health, make their advanced directive a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate). We DO everything to try to save them... but as a CPR, that's what it comes too.

kqh4ym,"EMT here. The other commenters got it right, basically CPR keeps blood flowing to vital organs (most importantly your brain 🧠) to keep oxygenated blood flow running and prevent organ death.

Also plz take a Class C CPR course. We can't always arrive within minutes to resuscitate someone when they go into cardiac arrest. A person's best chance to live is for bystanders to take action and perform life-saving first aid measures ASAP until first responders can take over. 

First aid is important to know incase you're ever in that position and have to save someone's life. It's always better to know first aid and never get a chance to use it than not know it and find yourself in a position where you're helpless.",2021-01-05 08:16:06

people not stopping for someone or something who clearly needs help... it makes NO sense to me. 

a few years ago I had a bad wreck at about 10 pm on Thanksgiving night. the guy that caused the wreck fled the scene, leaving me in my car that had spun out and slammed into a tree in the median. although it was night time, it was a fairly well lit area and it was VERY clear that I had just had a wreck. SEVENTEEN PEOPLE DROVE BY without stopping, and yes I counted. 

my car was smoking, facing the wrong way, partially wrapped around a tree, and 17 fucking people kept on going. many of them making eye contact with me as they passed. 

you are a true blessing for stopping for that pup.",2021-01-05 00:34:37
kqh4ym,I’m sorry you had to go through that. That’s really rough. Much love ❤️,2021-01-04 23:23:24
kqh4ym,"I am so sorry. For your loss and your experience. It's not easy to find someone unexpectedly in that state. I can't imagine what it's like with it being your mom.   I would imagine that the feeling of not attempting to save her at all would be worse and stick with you longer. You're a hero in my book for trying. 2 years and 9 mos ago My Dad took his last breath while we were face to face. He was on hospice (esophageal cancer) and it was expected but I can close my eyes and be fresh in that feeling at any given moment. My mother will be gone a year this Friday. Surgical complications (aortic aneurysm graft) and completely unexpected ... she was in ICU and I was not there when it happened. My mothers passing is more fresh and not ""supposed"" to happen but with being in the presence of my Dad when he died, regardless of his diagnoses and 5 month decline, it effects me more. 
It's not a fun club to be part of but your courage is admirable. ❤",2021-01-05 14:23:43
kqh4ym,"I'm very sorry as well , but happy to hear he lived a good life 🙂

y20nuh,"I was deployed and spent 6 months in Misawa Japan in 79 and you are right about wanting to visit. A beautiful country full of culturally wonderful people. Had to get used to covering my mouth when I spoke while eating, abd taking off my shoes before entering residences ( something I continue to do in my house. ) Most clubs had to go up pretty steep stairs to enter which made drinking too much ill advised when going down the steps. Toilet was basically a squat toilet, a tile lined hole that you squated over and had no seat to sit on... again, a good reason to drink responsible because balance was key. I believe that they have adopted European style toilets now. Hot baths which were supplied with water from volcanic activity was nice. Men were separated from women in public baths. You are nude or wear underwear and supposed to lather up and rinse before entering in a separate room before entering the hot springs, baths... Something that I was unaware of my first time. They looked at me with shock when I entered all lathered up. Good times. 😄",2022-10-12 13:48:46

When she received a letter from him one day, the censors had blacked so much that nearly nothing remained. All she could decipher was the word Enewetok. She got out her map and searched for hours. Finally found the atoll. Enewetok. In the middle of the Pacific. He was alive. ❤️",2021-01-16 05:01:23

He and his mom came up with a code beforehand, too - for example if he signed off with “Your Loving Son” it meant he was in Italy, “Missing You” meant he was in France, etc. Funnily enough most of the letters were him trying to get his mom to break up with his then-girlfriend for him.

srly4v,"My first thought was ""welcome to Germany"" 😂   
My grandparents were children during WW2 and my great grand parents wer just farmers as far as I know. But you always know someone whose grandparents were strong antisemite, a Nazi, someone who ""just helped"" the party or a soldier of the allied powers. Alone the Russian soldiers mass raped about 2 million women though at least 200.000 were raped to death and not everyone got pregnant and kept the babies. But we have about 500.000 children who were fathered by troops of the four allied powers. I've never had a history class were we discussed our families past in the WW2 and we didn't have at least one person who had one of these grandparents.",2022-02-13 21:41:10

srly4v,"Agreed.
Which is why it's so mind boggling to me when I hear my Italian-American aunts (and my mother) talk shit about black people.  They are in their 80s now. They are first generation - my maternal grandparents came from Italy.

It's like they've completely forgotten how they were viewed and treated. 🤦‍♀️",2022-02-13 20:41:47

onmxlu,"So when I was in high school junior year, we had a 3 credit course called IEE and it was basically an outdoors class mixed with English and Science. And with our last trip of the year, we rafted and had races to see which group (containing ~6 people) could flip their raft and get back in the fastest. Quiet a thrilling experience, it’s like a trust fall that you control (sort of😂)",2021-07-20 02:18:31

onmxlu,He’s probably already wet from flipping it over in the first place. What’s the point? 😂,2021-07-20 12:57:24

onmxlu,"I wasn’t prepared to flash back to the sailing camps of my youth this evening, but here we are. 

As an old(er) person with iffy knees (and judgement, if I’m honest), I kinda want a little sunfish I could easily handle and launch (and right, if capsized) on my own. I miss those little things 🥺",2021-07-19 23:57:33
onmxlu,"I kayak and canoe so I'm screwed if I flip.  Turning it over is nothing, *getting back in* is impossible.

Having said that, probably easy to clamber over the edge on something that big.  🤷

I'm perfectly dumb enough to try!  Don't judge me.",2021-07-20 01:04:35

Pro-tip: if you ever find yourself ending a comment with **in conclusion**, take a breather and go outside for some fresh air. Come back in, and then delete the dissertation you just spent an hour drafting.

fwiw I can just go ahead and finish this exchange for us. You’re going to reply, and accuse me of dodging your questions, implying that I’m not able to back up my position here. Then I’ll reply and clarify that I actually just don’t want to spend my entire Friday evening arguing semantics with some random person I never even addressed in the first place. Then you’ll either stop replying, or you’ll say that you aren’t arguing semantics, and you’ll try to explain why. But you won’t realize at that point that Im just screening your responses and not reading anything else you say to me from there out, in a desperate attempt to get you to stfu and leave me alone.

So, there we go, I just saved both of us a lot of time that we otherwise would have just wasted entirely. You’re welcome.",2023-03-03 22:06:17

om5s7h,"Humanity is special. You are just being pessimistic because it’s easy. Modern humans haven’t been around long but look at all we have accomplished, both good and bad ups and bad. We put people on the moon, planes, cars, boats. We’ve waged terrible war made weapons that turn people into dust. But we have eradicated diseases better healthcare than 50 years ago. The internet, satellite communication, world wide shipping. How much more do we have to do to be considered special. And we have endured. Black Death, war, famine, slavery, drought,floods, natural disasters. During all that people woke up and thought the world was ending and that life was over. We have legends and stories about it. But we endured, through all of that we endured as always, and through everything we’re going through right now as well. It’s hard to be optimistic but you can’t lose hope😇😇😇😇😇",2021-07-17 21:58:00

First, life with or without parole? 
A life sentence by the way, is around 15 to 25 years.


What *is* your point exactly? It took the States ten year's to jail 4 times the amount of people the Chinese government killed in a single event?


How many of those *convicted* people were shot(probably a few), bayoneted, ran over, crushed together into mush and washed down the street drain?


Dont get me wrong, the US has it's own issues, and the jail system is corrupt, but I can't think of anything the US has done to it's own citizens in the past 50 that comes anywhere near to the evil that was inflicted by the Chinese government to it's own citizens.

v18jep,"When i was 17 i got in a motorbike accident where i drove trough the crossroads with a stop sign which i ignored and i wore no helmet. I got hit by car directly from the left and i went straight trough the guys windshield with my face first (i remember seeing the guys decoration hanging from his rearview mirror for a split second) then slamming me off the car into the air while doing 980* and landing with the same face on the flor of the second ongoing traffic lane (which luckily stoped at that point) . I remember every millisecond of it . Time flew extremely slow. I stood up, looked at my hands. Legs were hurting like a bitch, my hands are going red. O shit. Why my hands red? I touch my face and everything is fucked up . Cant feel shit. My face is pouring blood. I see a guy that hit me (again, not his fault) standing , shaking and holding his mouth. I cant talk for some reason. I see a guy running like a mofo from a distance. Hes a doctor . He tells people what to do. The ambulance motorbike is alredy here (2min tops) does whatever he does . I couldnt see shit and i was swallowing blood and trying not to choke on it. Another 2 min goes by im in the ambulance. They flew in a top 3 prosthetic surgeon in the country. Dude said im fucked and they cant put me in a coma to do a surgery because im at risk of choking on my blood. They have to do it locally so the calmer i am the better the result. I was also missing skin. The surgery took almost 4 hours and after he was finished he said he did a really good job and it should be good. He had to redo my whole face . My nose was in 3 pieces, my mouth was shredded, my eyelid was hanging. Etc.. he did it perfectly. Other than some noticeable scars and ezio auditore the firenze mouth its perfect . I walked out the same day .

Granted i had to go to my doctor a couple days later cuz i was still bleeding from quite big laceration on my leg but at that point i was like whatever just a scratch. 


And it was all for free. Because we have public healthcare 😊 

So whoever that doctor was , thank you , you did a fantastic job even tho you were a dick and you had taken time to take pictures of my fucked face before and after and brag about it to the nurses, but other than that u the man , respect ✊",2022-05-30 21:51:43

v18jep,"Sigh.  I know people are trying to be nice, but saying it isn’t noticable is a very obvious lie.  Lies are a terrible way to reassure people.  It just tells them that people aren’t very trustworthy and can’t be relied on.

Especially when someone has undergone major and complex surgery with serious complications.

That being said, I’m guessing it was a major facial injury?  They don’t usually do surgery on Bell’s palsy unless it’s due to impingement etc.

So am guessing major trauma to the skull.  However, you survived with little minor issues mentally which is the major worry for head trauma.

Rather than look at it as disfigurement, look at it as a reminder than plastics was originally made for people like you.  The ones who need it due to accident/trauma.

Not to look like x y x celebrity etc or look young ‘forever’. 😄

You survived whatever it was that happened to you.  Which is amazing! Cranial nerves being affected is a very rare thing.",2022-05-30 23:49:43

v18jep,"Well, he mentioned Bell’s palsy and I can see the side it affected him.  Not the hairline thing (that isn’t noticable at all to be honest unless someone was going to crawl around his hairline to see it).

Independent of the reason for the post, he is good looking 😂.  A little too young for me I think.

Creepy I know, but I guess since it’s sorta about looks, I guess it’s ok to comment how he’s good looking he is when it’s true. 😂

Personally I think it means the OP has a great story and explanation.  And I would totally ask what happened and tell him why I asked.

Whatever it was, it was bad.  Usually they try to make it unnoticeable unless it was ‘really’ bad.",2022-05-30 23:58:21

You can say nice things without giving a disclaimer of ""it's okay for me to say nice things to you, I'm not gay!""

Just like, say the nice thing. Leave gay people out of it.

There will still be lingering disappointment/shame in myself (I mean obv I wish they weren’t there but not like I can do shit about it), so it’s not like I’d ever randomly point mine out to flex or something, but never again will I let another person bring me down or make me feel bad for having them. Besides, anyone who WOULD point out something like that in a shitty way is clearly not a good person so I’m already in a better place than them emotionally, even tho I was a junkie in the past. How the f do you like me now?! lol. I get the impression that you’re doing better now and hope that’s true, hang in there! ❤️‍🩹",2022-05-31 03:02:27

x4qnvy,"A truly remarkable individual. An adopted kid who went through an abusive childhood, Louganis survived an horrific relationship with his former manager who at one point raped him at knifepoint, infecting him with HIV. At a time when being publicly “out” was almost a death sentence for your career he became a very vocal advocate for gay rights. The vast majority of his wealth was stolen by the same manager, against whom he had to take out a no-contact court order. I’m not often impressed by celebrity lives, but Greg Louganis is a truly good man who used his fame to do good. He held a farewell party on his 33rd birthday as he expected to die young- thankfully he’s been blessed with another 30 years of life which he has used to advocate for civil rights.

Classic physique bodybuilding has a weight limit of 240lbs for people between 6'1 and 6'2 and they are usually at a lower bodyfat percentage than 8%. You are claiming to have been 40lbs less than that limit and only be maybe 2% to 3% higher body fat then competitors at mr Olympia classic physique.

1. The child has no true / realistic understanding of his attire and whatever he's been told and, the cop knows this.
2. This norm his caregivers have bestowed upon him is a large part of what's wrong in this world and the poor lad is none-the-wiser.

x76768,"Don't get me wrong hate is a natural human instinct. I think that it's the least auto-governed one though. Thought has to go into hate. You can't do it without thinking about it is my point really. And back to the original point. To dress a child up like that and teach him to hate people because of what color their skin is or what God they worship. Without being able to make up his/her mind  alone. Alot of thought went into those lessons. All n all. Racism is a special kind of hate that no one needs to think, believe or practice outside of one's own thoughts. In my experience I've met some really nice welled rounded black folk. I've also met some black folk that are complete ignorant a***oles. Also met plenty people of other races with the same qualities and differences. Believe what you want. Be what color you were given. Don't hate me for mine and I won't even have a thought about bashing yours. It's easy in the midst of it 😃",2022-09-06 11:59:39

>What about “us” is shared...? 

Things like ""housekeeping"" genes. Like the genes which help do basic processes in your cells- from adhesion molecules, lipids, actin molecules, transport molecules....stuff like that. Every living thing with DNA has some sharing of common genes like that. The stuff that's different is what makes us humans unique....like the genes necessary for making a brain with neurons. As far as I'm aware a banana doesn't have a brain 😉.

>Does that mean we share genes with like redwood trees?

Yes.....yes it does.

>Almost anything that is “alive” at some point (plants, mushrooms, any animal, etc.)?

Yes, we're going to share some basic amount of genes from anything with DNA. This could be 5% all the way up to 99% (like with chimps). 

What's really neat to me is that it's 50% with bananas and not like 10%. We share 63% of genes with fruit flies (who love bananas). It's like we all are related at some fundamental level....yet we inevitably feast on each other one way or another.",2020-10-02 04:57:34

He's also wearing a patch that says something like, ""They die, but we go to heaven."" (And to be clear, he's a commander of some sort--not a conscript, a willing volunteer)   

He's been captured and is laying in a Ukranian hospital bed. They have a video asking him if he's reconsidered his position, and he says, ""Yes, Putin's a shithead."" Like some 6th graders took him captive, lol.  

I don't think I could show mercy towards the very soldiers who are indiscriminately murdering civilians with a smile on their face. The Ukranians are better people than me. Showing mercy towards monsters, and giving them food and medical aid. That's just mind boggling to me. Slava Ukrani! 🇺🇦",2022-03-03 18:08:24

iu35z9,"Ah yeah I wondered if it was a bad pronunciation.  Wondered if he was just shouting out a random bonsai which made no sense in which case it could have been a banzai (which is like celebration cheer)  but if he is specifically talking about bonsai then it sounds like bad pronunciation.  

That said if they say karate the way Australians do....  It's wrong 😂  kara is correct but the te is more like the te of ten than tea.  (I trained karate for years and then learnt Japanese,  it still feels weird to pronounce karate correctly 😅)",2020-09-16 22:04:37

iu35z9,"I don't wanna alarm you guys; you have a plant and it looks cool and you probably like it and that's totally fine! But it's probably not a real bonsai tree. If you buy a ""bonsai"" that is just labeled bonsai without some kind of explanation of the species (or without being decently expensive) it's probably just some kind of herb that has been pruned into a bonsai-like shape! 

Again, nothing wrong with that, but real bonsais are a lot of work and take a crazy amount of time to grow, so they're usually quite pricy and hard to take care of 😅",2020-09-17 03:08:38

Michael deviates from the lip sync, tucks into guys shoulder and yells at him (prolly to “hold on, dipshit!!!).  Meanwhile instead of wrapping his arms and legs around Michael, line 99.9 percent of us would…if we were worked up enough to Mount stage, shirk a SECURITY TEAM and then climb up large moving equipment….instead he goes full Titanic  🚢 “I’m King of the world!!”

Double fail for crew.  Security wasn’t paying attention to stage and tech guys should have brought the thing down immediately, yanked him off and then sent MJ back up.  If micheal could go on with the show holding the guy ….while he kept looking down to his peeps like  “anyone seeing this?!?

Knossos is the big, highlight ruins to visit but Phaistos (the site of the famous disc) is also totally worth a visit as it hasn’t been rebuilt unlike Knossos. It’s closer to the south side of the island. To this day, they have not translated the Disc of Phaistos.

Kalitsounia are cookies native to Crete. They’re made w Myzithra - a type cheese - but also sugar and cinnamon. They are amazing but places can run out later in the afternoon; you have to get them somewhat early

I pretended like I couldn't remember it very well and acted like I only knew a couple letters, she bought it tho and they never talked to me about it again.

pqtvfc,"Primates in general. It's pretty mind-blowing when you spend some time in the ""monkey house"" at your local zoo. Went one time to practice my sketching skills and had a profound moment with a pigmy marmoset (sounds like I'm fucking with you, but I'm not). After watching me draw (probably wondering what I wear doing) for 10 minutes, he put his tiny hand on the glass. So I put my hand on the glass. He looked at my hand and then he looked me right in the eyes. It was like he realized we were related in some way. And so did I. I STILL tear up when I think about that moment. ..Then some other marmoset hopped over and fucked with him and the connection was broken. 🥲",2021-09-18 23:29:05

So if things were bigger when we were small doesn’t that mean the resolution we saw the world at was lower?",2021-08-12 14:40:56

lxkh0u,"I would imagine it’s more about slowly decreasing the pressure, as long as you don’t immediately rip it from the high pressure environment.

Not exactly the same, but people who work out on oil rigs, where they’re doing stuff a mile under water: they have contraptions that bring them back up to the rig, but it’s extremely slow moving, in order to slowly decrease the water pressure around them. A dramatic decrease of pressure over a short period of time can very literally rip a human body apart, instantaneously. 

I’m no scientist, but I’d imagine the case might be *slightly* similar in the case of this magnificent little squid.

m34nkw,"Worked in trauma/ortho OR, ED, and MICU as a nurse for about 14 years- I don’t think emotional stability is the right word (at least for me) but you learn to go numb and just see the task at hand and try not to read too much into a persons death as related to your own life. Leave the job at the door and all that. But I clearly don’t have coping skills because I burned out of hospital nursing and now do insurance workers comp case management. Also I’m a binge drinker on my days off and know there’s things in my life I need to sort out before it becomes a problem. Nursing has taught me the world can be a down right shitty and cruel place, but outstandingly beautiful at the same time. I still have some issues with a few cases of end of life morphine drips to comfort titration (aka assisted euthanasia in a state where it’s not legal) because families weren’t on the same page... 🤷‍♂️",2021-03-12 04:15:46

Get over yourself, you're not special, just a weasel who has no good reason to breed other than to satisfy his own ego. You're nada but a selfish cretin who needs to look in the mirror and slap himself repeatedly.

Because I'm child free means no one wants to fuck me? Ahahah enjoy your depressing life having to wake up at 3am every single day for the majority of your life. And remember this thread when your child is suffering, remember this thread when your child says that he/she hates you. 🤪

1. Stop making 1$ BILLS and mint 1$ COINS instead, which last 10-20 years longer.
2. Stop bothering with pennies and round up/down (like in Canada).

dnugdy,My problem is it’s seasonal. I did this a few years ago when we first moved into our house… I didn’t know this trick particularly but I went about it a similar way. But then summer time came and the door was clipping at the top so I readjusted… And sure enough when winter came it was clipping at the side again. Now 5 years later I just except it 😂 I guess I could shave a bit off the door but I am lazy,2019-10-28 04:01:47

rgis4p,"To see more of my space photography shot with backyard telescope equipment, you can always find me on Instagram [@thevastreaches](https://www.instagram.com/thevastreaches/)  
  
I was able to get the solar scope pointed at the Sun for the first time in too long!    Conditions definitely weren’t great but it sure felt good to finally soak up some photons after the hiatus.  
  
Here’s a look at the upper atmosphere of our star from yesterday, 13-DEC-2021.   The twisted mess toward the top is the developing Active Region 12907 which was just named today.  
  
This was shot through a specialized telescope and filter to reveal the structures within the chromosphere, an outer layer of the Sun which stands above the photosphere (commonly considered the opaque “surface” of the sun).   The chromosphere is comprised of tendrils of hydrogen plasma which aligns to the local magnetic field.    We can essentially see properties of the magnetic field by visualizing this hydrogen layer.   
  
Don’t ever, ever point a telescope at the Sun without knowing how to handle the energy that is collected!

No way

It's a 14' tunnel and no, it's not flat. The invert is curved, obviously, so it's not a flat walking surface. Plus there's a narrow-gauge train track down the middle for machines back-and-forth feeding the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), so there's no room to walk at all. But, we do it 🤷‍♂️

Detroit is in the news currently, actually, for the highways flooding every time it rains. 2 weeks ago, and then again tonight, I-94 flooded and cars were washed away.

So now, 2021, they're building a massive storm water tunnel under I-75 to help contain all that rain water so it doesn't flood anymore.

Yeah! I actually use Shudder a lot. I've watched some of Joe Bob's and honestly just skip through the commentary and interviews. Some of the films he shows are kind of harder to find (I also collect movies and keep an active list of movies I've watched with ratings/notes!)

After going through such an experience, nobody would have any anxiety, fear or depression, about themselves, the future or the world. It would pale in comparison.

That would end this modern western epidemic of anxiety & depression IMO.

We could have already been in agreement but it doesn't sound like you care about getting closer to the truth, sounds like you just care about winning something that only you've made into a competition.

Even your phrasing indicates that:
>Actually youre only proving my point about confirmation bias

Proving *your* point huh? Guess that means you're leading in your made up scoreboard huh?

Just face it man, you tried to lash out on someone who you thought was anti-capitalist because maybe you've been annoyed by those types but once you found out I'm not one of those types you still can't let it go because you have to take out your frustration on someone and maybe stroke your ego about how sound your logic is. 🤦‍♂️",2022-04-05 15:53:23

il6zbd,"The title is so misleading 😒

The building never had a roof. It had several floors above what is seen in the photos. However, it was against the building codes and they didn't have proper permits, so they tore down the excess floors. Water accumulated in the basement/lower floors, which then became a breeding ground for mosquitos; so they added fish to fix the issue. The building was abandoned a long time ago, and most of the water has dried out. You can find a deep puddle here and there and you'll see that there are some fish still living in those puddles. 

Also, fun fact: someone died in the mall, during the demolition of the upper floors.",2020-09-02 17:05:17

It saddens me that humanity can have such hate for people that are different from themselves and do horrendous tragic things like 9/11. Sadly the list of atrocities and hate goes on and on.

For anyone else with this ""issue"" - things you can do to leave the world a better place: 

&#x200B;

\- Reducing  meat-consumption, e.g. once a week instead of every other day

&#x200B;

\- Ideally living plant based (e.g. oat milk instead of cow milk; margarine instead of butter)

&#x200B;

\- Eating local and seasonal vegetables and fruits (e.g. apples instead of pineapples, walnuts instead of avocado)

&#x200B;

\- Minimize use of plastics (e.g. by re-using plastic bags as many times as possible; using mason jars for storage of food, herbs, spices and alike; buying from ""unpacked supermarkets""; switching to metal/wood/glass versions of one-time-use plastics like straws)",2019-04-22 15:26:54

la1i9f,You would not believe the g-force limits planes can take. It's incredible how strong they are for how light they are. And if you see the wings flexing that's essentially a sign that they're doing their job. If they didn't flex it would stress the airframe and lead to stress over time.

124sb90,Took my service dog with me when I went to the zoo. The animals loved her and she loved the animals. She behaved perfectly and did her job very well…except for one moment when she got super excited to see a wolf on the other side of the glass 1-2 feet away. (He couldn’t see her.) My SD forgot herself and begged me to play with him (as if that would have gone well 😂) for about two seconds until I reminded her of the rules and her job… and then she was good again.,2023-03-28 22:21:18

Yeah, it wasn't a service dog. Just a dog that should have been left at home or shoved into the cargo hold. But this is the world we live in now.

Also, I believe your story. 100%. You've been downvoted however because for a redditor, the idea that a dog would take a bunch of huge sloppy stinking dumps on a plane mid-flight is too much to comprehend. *Theres no way a doggo would ever do that* 🤪

b6vt5o,"> I still feel like I failed Charlie and I wish he was here with me today. I haven’t gotten a dog since cause I’m too scared to lose them right when I begin to love them. 

You did not fail Charlie, I promise. 💔

Your situation is similar to my own, Mr. Whiskers was with me for 3 years before out of nowhere he wouldn't eat. After much $$$$ spent, they still couldn't figure out what was wrong. Despite my efforts, I still lost. I still get flashbacks to the last moments keeling down to be at his level to make eye contact before he left my world. It was easy to blame myself, despite the lack of control. But it's all survivor's guilt. Anything that loved us doesn't want us to live that way. We forgive to honor their love.

Unwillingly, I had to forgive myself and accept that my kitty knew I loved him and tried to save him. I learned that the measure of our strength or worth isn't from how successful we are, but the effort we gave when it was the hardest, impossible, or a no-win.

Part of forgiving is to accept that I was not a bad person, putting that into motion was to adopt again. 2 months after he passed, I got Caesar and soon after Attila. After a couple months of being an owner again, the heartache and guilt came back for Whiskers. For moving on, it gave me this twisted feeling that I was forgetting about him. My spouse suggested that I pay tribute to him, giving him a space in the house. Digging through old computers, I searched to find any good pictures with him and frame it in a collage with tassels to honor my study buddy. For some reason that has been really helpful to not feel that intense, raw pain.

I understand your vulnerability completely. Losing something suddenly that you emotionally invested so much into too soon is soul crushing. But you are no failure, but a champ who just got knocked down by tragedy. You deserve to get back up and try again, love again (when you are ready.)

I hope my story helps you find your way. ALL the hugs. Love and be lovely. ",2019-03-29 15:13:58

uym9th,"When I first learned the idea of ""junk"" DNA in a college class about 15 years ago, I thought it was interesting that 95% of our genome was involved in ways unknown to us, not coding for proteins. I think that's when I learned about the field of epigenetics.

The idea of ""junk"" DNA became debunked as [researchers found that the entire human genome was active](https://www.icr.org/article/junk-dna-myth-continues-its-demise) in regulating gene expression and RNA. I'm not a specialist in this area, but I think it was interesting to see how a simple, tantalizing idea such as ""junk DNA"" took hold in the public, even as research rendered the original idea obsolete.

Genetics is quite complex. 🧬

9x3vcd,"What is VersiDrain® 8 Mesh
VersiDrain® 8 Mesh is a translucent dimpled plastic drainage sheet with an integrated plastic mesh. It is used as a base for plastering or shotcreting on walled underground structures, excavated rock surfaces and tunnels. The dimpled sheet also acts as a seepage layer to control dampness on basement walls.The dimples provide an air gap for reliable ventilation between the outer and inner walls.

VersiDrain® 8 Mesh creates an effective vapour barrier and the integrated plastic mesh ensures efficient bonding of the plaster or shotcrete to the dimpled sheet. Plaster boards and timber panels may be used as alternative finishes that are fastened using proprietary.

VersiDrain® fixing accessories.

VersiDrain® 8 Mesh, being translucent, allows easy alignment and location of fixing positions.

hztfbi,"Its not a stupid statement. Think pre internet. You are a farmer who's parents and grandparents were farmers and you've always lived in the same town. You see this huge glowing burning thing above your head you've never seen before and start talking about it.

 ""You dummy"" have a conversation like an adult. Everyone already thinks you UFO folks are off your rockers as it is, you aren't helping your case by jumping to middle school playground insults when you run out of real points. The US government fighter pilot video very clearly does not show any ""impossible manuevers""it's a blurry video o that is pretty much impossible to determine anything from.  I'f you have other ones feel free to link them but don't throw a fit.😂

It's VERY possible that some or even many ""UFO"" sightings were this type of event. OP didn't say ALL UFO sightings. By definition anyone who doesn't know this was a meteor say a UFO. There's no""crashing"" happening in the video either lol.",2020-07-29 16:37:47

ues8yc,"I remember mentioning a story from my clinical training on reddit a year ago about my experience with a c-section. Fun times lmao

>Im a med tech and as part of training i witness an emergency c-section. Ive also seen a live birth and i can tell you a c-section is much more terrifying. Since i was still in training the other nurses/med techs just put me in a closet with a window view that forced me to stand on my toes (Im 5’8”). I remember i showed up just as the doctor finished donning her sterile gown and went straight to cutting the patient’s abdomen with what seemed like a laser. Once she hit the muscle she used her bare hands to literally rip the muscle apart (its easier for muscles to recover from a tear then a precise incisions 🤷‍♂️) Once the doc was through she inserted this ring that opens into a tube for the baby to travel through into the abdomen. All I remember was everything looked like it was going smooth until the gap where the doctors arms were in began filling with blood instantly. Then everything started to move fast. No one really was talking me through what was going on because everyone was running around grabbing supplies but it looked like the doctor nicked a blood vessel and she was trying to stop the bleeding. Next thing I know the tube she inserted earlier flung out of the patient and towards where i was at leaving blood all over the floor and window. At that point the staff made an announcement for a code purple (if I remember its a medical emergency regarding pediatrics.) in an instant it felt like the entire hospital went to help out. This was a military hospital so seeing the commander and other high ranking officials show up behind me kinda made me anxious. I also saw a nurse have a mental breakdown and one of the officers was trying to console her. Finally the doctor got the child out but it was so purple it looked like thanos was birthed. There was no screaming, no movement. The doctor handed the child to my preceptor and another tech to resuscitate it while she worked on stopping the bleeding. The techs began the standard cpr/suctioning routine for the baby and after a few long minutes you could see slight twitching, then slow movements, and finally some screaming/crying. While this was going on the doctor used a the same laser thing to cauterize all the bleeding and then I believed she used a mixture of staples and stitches to finally close the wound. This was probably the one of the most terrifying things ive seen there and i was later told by my preceptor that this is routine for them. Since then ive had a lot a appreciation for labor and delivery staff as well as respect for the mothers that have to go through such a thing.

>TL;DR: C-sections can be terrifying and i have a lot of respect for people who perform them and families that undergo them.",2022-04-30 00:46:57

ues8yc,Remember to warm in microwave first. 😂,2022-04-30 02:09:52
ues8yc,"Depends - if your anesthesiologist assesses your airway as being difficult, they might have to do an awake intubation in which case it will be a bit uncomfortable in that you may have episodes of coughing when they put the local anesthetic in (if they use liquid or sprays) and it will feel weird having the tube put in, plus local doesn't taste nice. But when everything is numb people tolerate the process really well and can even move about with the tubes in and breath through them ok. If you have a good anesthesiologist the whole thing will be weird but not painful and not that bad. Plus you get drugs that help smooth the whole process out, make you happy and forgetful (even if awake).

If your airway is considered ok, they'll knock you out first and then do the tube so you'll never know you had it.

Shouldn't have any significant pain in your nose afterwards when you wake up.

All the best for your surgery, hope it goes well!

It was just an instant reaction of complete revulsion, I just wanted it away from me, I wasn't expecting anything like that, had never seen anything like that. Just BAM dead kid in my face.   

Anyway her phone went flying into the concrete with a loud clatter and then we were just both standing there frozen for a long awkward moment til I shouted ""don't show me that shit!"" and she said ""Okay damn!"" And then she never did it again and we never talked about it again. 🤷‍♀️

jjslsf,"The Taliban banned opium as a cash crop in 2000. The next year, Afghanistan was invaded by the US, and one of the first things US generals told local farmers was to restart poppy production (in typical american fashion they  they told the farmers they now had the Freedom™ to pursue their old livelihoods since the taliban ban had affected the local economy).

According to the U.N, poppy cultivation was down to approximately 8,000 hectares in 2001, then skyrocketed to  74,000 hectares after the American invasion. 

Today opium is grown on 328,000 hectares. Despite America spending 1.5 million everyday since 2001 on counter narcotics in afghanistan (this is on top of the $1 trillion spent on the war on terror).

The end result of the last 20 years is that america's economy has benefited from fueling the war machine in afghanistan. And the multi billion dollar global heroin trade is humming along quite smoothly thanks to  US intervention turning Afghanistan into a narco-state. For the US, it's mission accomplished.",2020-10-28 22:12:37
