lvzqh4,"> That's such a dumb question to ask. No. I didn't go to North Korea as an American. That seems like a totally safe place to visit. 🤦‍♀️

This is a fantastic demonstration of how little you apparently know about this topic. Cheers to that!

It *is* in fact a safe place to visit, even for Americans. Thousands of foreign tourists -- including Americans -- visit the country every year (pre-COVID / pre US-led travel restrictions) with no issue or problem.

In the cases where there are issues, the tourists in question knowingly did something they were not allowed to do while there.

In most cases they're simply asked to leave (this according to people I've spoken to who have worked in the country for a very long time). In some cases, they're asked to write an apology and then leave. In rare cases, there are severe penalties that are absolutely absurd -- these are the cases you're most likely to have heard about.

But in all cases, these people knowingly did something they were not supposed to do while visiting a country with a reputation for strict punishment -- smuggled Bibles, lied about their identity, entered prohibited spaces and stole something, etc.

And no -- it's not a ""all you have to do is accidentally slip up once"" situation. As a personal anecdote, I've inadvertently gone against the rules in the DPRK before, and all I got was a gentle reminder from a Korean when they noticed what I had done. I've never accidentally stolen something or tried to distribute religious materials.

Singapore also has highly restrictive rules and punishments we might consider severe for various things. And so for that reason, I don't spit gum on the sidewalk and vandalize property while I'm there.

I'm not excusing severe penalties. They're dumb. But they're also not happening in a vacuum, or to your average, respectful tourist who is there to learn more about an interesting country.

In many ways, the DPRK is one of the safest destinations I've ever been to as an American. There's very little petty crime. You don't have to watch your back. It's not super crowded. You often have a local nearby who has keeping you safe as part of their job. And in general there just aren't as many opportunities to do something that might get you into trouble as you might find elsewhere.

> There are tours of NK from all periods of time. Took me 15 seconds to find one from 2020.

The whole plane in front of me dropped, I thought “so this is how it ends.” Pilot grabbed the controls, you could feel it. He fought it this way, that way, we kept dropping. Left, right again God or whatever anyone believes in bless him. Over and over. Nobody screamed, there was no time to. Just speak within ourselves & think our goodbyes. 

But after about 3 to 5 minutes or maybe 10 that seemed like an eternity, the shaking lessened and I could tell we were climbing.

I woke up around 6am when they had breakfast before  landing in Mumbai and thought “what a crazy dream, scared me shitless.” But then I looked at the in-seat video airplane map screen and it showed our path with a red line and little half circle midway through the Bay of Bengal. Wasn’t a dream. ⭕️

But landing in Mumbai was my first trip to India so that experience was also a wake-up culturally, maybe that shock helped me not have lasting effects & overwrote the other a bit. And I had taken private pilot lessons while in the USAF, so that kinda helped understand what happened. Still here (crosses fingers).🤞

I try to make every day since as good as I can for me and those I’m able to help. And still love flying / travel!✈️",2022-12-20 00:45:07

The only time I felt sketched out was in Georgia, I don’t remember where exactly but it was a real dump and everyone just sort of stared at me and gave me dirty looks.

I took 35 days, you can do the trail MUCH faster but I took my time, there were a few detours and a few campsites that were too good to spend just one day. Along the way I linked up with buddies from the Marines in each state and went fishing wherever I saw water 😂. I gotta say Colorado was the highlight, so much wildlife, great views, great fishing, so much public land and reasonable camping rules. When I was finished I shipped the bike home and took a plane back to NY. I’ve been looking at grey buildings and endless strings of brake lights ever since...sigh.",2018-03-17 03:42:06

So now the bike is sitting with a basically brand new tkc80 rear in my garage, 100 miles from any dirt 😩.

I’m up in Westchester all the time, my gf lives up there, ANY recommendations for anything off-road in New York would be MUCH appreciated. I’m starving for dirt here!

The wildlife and scenery are incredible and it's a perfect place to visit if you enjoy walking, relaxing and eating locally sourced seafood. It's been suffering over the last few years with the sheer amount of tourism that visit, but ironically depends on them for income. Make sure you book accommodition well in advance ( the local police have been known to turn people away at Skye bridge if they haven't made plans).

The biggest bit of advice I can give any tourist is respect the locals when driving about. Visitors have been known to stop around blind corners and dump their cars causing accidents just to take photos etc. Please please please stick to the speed limit, if it's a 60mph road don't do 30mph and use passing places on the single track roads where possible.

8ml0fg,">...but if you take a deep breath...

Lolz, wanna be careful with that one. Assuming one is healthy enough to do so considering the pollution, there really is little, if anything _pleasant_ to smell.

I get the spirit of your comment, but the issues with the city are a more complicated than just perspective. There are good and bad things taking place unique to the city. A lot of the ""cool stuff"" people share/want are just average normal city life stuff. Any other city will suffice. I strive to enjoy the little things, but really, there isn't anything unique to LA accessible without decent 💸. Though all the bad is open to all, specially for the not well off.

I go in for one thing & end up with $50 worth of things & the fast food joints aren’t doing me any favors either, I obviously am not a smart woman. 😃.  I live on the outskirts of a major city.   I’d rather have everything within reach, but would probably save an enormous amount of money if I didn’t.

But the rest of Cairo, I went to the museum and basically hung out in my hotel for the rest of the time since I didn’t want to deal with the locals. Luxor and Aswan were very nice and a little bit calmer than Cairo. It’s sad, the country has a ton to offer but it got annoying to try and be ripped off every single step of the way. I remember close to my hotel in Luxor, I went to buy a bottle of water from the little store and he charged me 15 EGP. I go back the next day for another and it’s another guy working and he charged me 10 EGP. I was like…..bro, your coworker charged me 15 yesterday and he went 🤷‍♂️ 

Would I go back? Maybe to Alexandria and Sharm El Sheik but that’s it. I’m glad I crossed it off my list",2022-09-19 09:22:57

xi4qz9,"Hi! Another Egyptian here while I do agree with you those high tourist areas are the worst, I myself and a lot of my friends don’t go for that reason. There are other areas outside Cairo like Alex, siwa, dahab, hurgada, north coast, and Luxor and Aswan I would recommend for tourists. People there are super friendly and accommodating and I always I advice my friends from abroad you can visit but it would be better if you know actual locals there that can take you to all these places. Sadly that’s the best and safest way to visit since our government is a mess like I am sure it is in other countries. But I will ask you kindly to not over generalize all Egyptians being like that, i have faced some harassments even sexual harassments from other nationalities when I travel as well. The difference is I do not take it as “oh everyone from-there must be like that, and I’ll never visit again”. 
Real locals are actually very giving people that live in areas like zamalek, masr el gedida and the fifth settlements. I am very sorry you had to experience all this stuff. But Thank you for sharing your experience and speaking out 💗✨


Edit: I also forgot to add, that Egypt has a long and complicated history of being colonized by the French, Romans and British that stole a lot of the lands wealth and tortured the people. I’m saying this to give context how these things still have effecting consequences still till this day. There are more than 60% of the population that live below the poverty line and are just trying to survive so sadly they restore to these kind of hustling behaviors. That’s why sadly illegal black markets exist, which btw all of its customers are from the west. Again I am adding historical context to explain how things got to this, but everyone can do their own research before visiting places.",2022-09-19 17:08:08

She also had a group of men follow her onto a ferry and it took going into the captains room to get away from them. No one would help her.

She traveled alone all over the world with just her backpack to almost every country, and had never experienced anything like this. She said she crossed Egypt off her list for good on that trip which was 20 years ago.",2022-09-20 05:46:57

He was standing next to me and got his seat back after dropping on my destination. 

Traffic 🚦 are just decorations and pedestrian crossing graffiti painting. I nearly got run over by a car near the Egyptian Museum 🤣

But the taxi driver who drove me to my hotel from the bus station, was very kind and honest, so I hope it lasts. 

My point is, people after covid are desperate for money, the tourism industry will take a long time to recover. So, it is better to only travel in organized tours to non western, muslim countries, that and just look unfriendly and like you have no money. Those are my suggestions.",2022-09-19 09:06:04

I remember going into in in Montenegro where it was the bare essentials and when I bought beer theu simply gave me a paper receipt so I could bring the bottles back for recycling. It's completely different from my home country and that would seem highly inefficient but it's one of many memories from travel that I cherish greatly. It's the little details like this that do it for me.

I always like to learn a little bit of the language of the countries I visit and grocery store always allow.me to practice, which I love.

9m9jd8,"Culture: The National Gallery; The National Portrait Gallery; The Tate; Any of the museums - these are all free entry. 

Touristy: Tower of London; London Eye; West End musical, there's loads. Covent Garden (street entertainment, bars, cafes etc.)

Food: Le Mercury, Islington, N1 -  excellent French food, cheap - plus loads of bars in the vicinity. Good alternative to the West End for an evening out. If you book, ask for Le Mercury one (they have 2 restaurants close to each other) and if you can, get the table for two in the window upstairs. Really cosy. 

Pollen Street Social, Mayfair, W1 - Michelin starred, superb food. Highly recommended (I used to be a professional chef at The Dorchester, Park Lane, so I tend to be a bit fussy when it comes to fine dining.) 

Colbert, Sloane Square, Chelsea, SW1 - Perfect for brunch, coffee, something stronger, and you're at the top of The King's Road, and just around the corner from Harrods. 

Shopping: From Marble Arch to Tottenham Court Road: you've got Oxford Street, Regent Street, Bond Street, Selfridges, Carnaby Street  all at your disposal. 

Hope that gives you some ideas! Those are my picks for a short trip here in London 😊

6bjjox,"The difference is subtle, and the IPA uses the same symbol for both. It's more regional differences in how the sound is pronounced in Catalonia vs in other parts of Spain.
If you are a native Catalan speaker, you probably pronounce ñ when you are speaking Spanish the same way you pronounce ny when you are speaking Catalan.

You can see the difference, for example, in this [interview to Guardiola](https://youtu.be/uHRZgF5myKw). You can notice the difference in how the interviewer pronounces the ñ in Cataluña (stronger, slightly longer), and how Guardiola pronounces it (a bit softer and moving the tongue a bit forward).

I think you would notice it more if it was a Spanish native speaker learning Catalan, but I don't have a good clip of that. 🤷🏻‍♂️",2017-05-17 17:21:08

> In 1991 Kaili and Lars operated the first commercial passenger balloon in Turkey for a German tour operator.
Since then Lars and Kaili's balloon operation in Cappadocia has became the benchmark for quality tourism in Turkey and was adopted by the Turkish Tourist Board. Being the oldest established ballooning company in Turkey, Kapadokya Balloons have flown more passengers in Turkey than all the other balloon companies combined, past and present.

Lots of police officers everywhere obviously, but prefer to go in groups or locals if you're a foreigner, not alone (fights and pickpockets heh).

There are several other places in France you should go if you're more adventurous. And you're welcome on /r/france for advice on your vacation trip (places, food, safety, and most importantly drinks).

13bn3wg,"I stay at almost exclusively Airbnbs when I travel and run my own, and I've never been asked or asked my guests to do more than take out garbage and wash their own dishes. 

Well that's not true, one asked me to sort my recycling 😂",2023-05-08 17:05:13
13bn3wg,🙋🏽‍♂️🙋🏽‍♂️unless it’s fir a big group hotels have the better deals now.,2023-05-08 17:59:48
13bn3wg,"Preciously I was using AirBnb, but nowadays I use hotels.com whenever I can. Mostly because every 10 nights gets you 1 night for free. So it works great when I am booking business trips and then use free nights for personal 😉
But like most of the people here, if I am travelling with a group then prefer Airbnb so we can have a nice common area for hanging out.",2023-05-08 18:55:56
13bn3wg,"I love having a kitchen, open space, and other amenities that only exist in a residence. 💕 So I rarely opt for a hotel; I just make sure I understand the AirBnB’s policies and fees before booking.",2023-05-08 18:57:00
13bn3wg,"Absolutely 💯. After learning what they’ve done in Athens and other places, I can’t/won’t support them",2023-05-08 20:07:41
13bn3wg,"I am using Airbnb on my trip in December because it was cheaper. 

But, last year, we used VRBO for the first time.  We were so excited about our first family vacation to Florida. The place we rented had 2 full bathrooms. 1 was private in the master bedroom. And I booked this place specifically for the private bathroom because we had 4 kids. And I wanted to have some peace at shower time. 

Anyways, we get there and find out there is absolutely NO WATER PRESSURE in the second bathroom. And there was mold growing in the vent in the kids bathroom. I messaged the lady and she was like ""yeah, the water pressure is not that great in that shower. But, at least you get some water."" 🙄. I was livid. Because we went to the beach and there was no pressure to even wash the sand out of your cracks (if you know what I mean) . 

And then, the next morning rolls around, and a guy with a very loud leaf blower starts blowing leaves all around the front porch and by the master bedroom. It was like 7am. I messaged again and said, I thought this place was supposed to be quiet. She was like ""well, the property needs to be maintained. It doesn't get pretty by itself."" 🙄 And I was basically said ""I booked this place for the 2nd shower, which doesn't work and the quiet so I can sleep. It's our vacation after all."" 

I will never book VRBO again.",2023-05-08 20:16:18
13bn3wg,"Yeah about seven years ago. 

What's the incentive, aside from staying in someone else's place awkwardly, having to coordinate meeting them or cracking the davinvci code to get in, not having your space cleaned and then having nowhere to store your bags if you're either side of check in or out, all for the same price. Real enticing 👍",2023-05-08 21:36:45
13bn3wg,"Yes. My last airbnb had bedbugs. Also, it was set up like a hostel and not my actually staying with someone.  Four rooms, each with locked doors and  keys,  one shared bathroom. This was not disclosed in the listing. I thought i would be staying just with the owner, who actually never lived there. If i wanted to stay in a hostel, i wouldn't have paid so much for the stay.

Then the bedbugs. And the airbnb rep denying my claim, even with pictures of my body covered in bites. She asked to see a picture of an actual bedbug as proof of my claim. 🤦🏿‍♀️

I ended up sending emails to the CEO and the entire executive suite, letting them know the public relations shitstorm i would reign on them if they didn't compensate me for the nightmare. That got their attention. My stay was refunded plus a $400 credit. Used the credit once and I've since given up and went back to hotels.",2023-05-08 23:07:30
13bn3wg,"Rented a whole farmhouse out in the wilds of Wales in 2019 for 55 pounds a night. It was haunted as f, but a great value 😁",2023-05-09 01:19:49
13bn3wg,"As a mostly solo traveller, I’ve never used Airbnb. The convenience of hotels or actual bed and breakfasts or guesthouses is more appealing to me. The one time my cousin booked an Airbnb for a family trip, I wasn’t very impressed with the hosts or the cleaning expectations 🤷🏻‍♀️",2023-05-09 02:58:34
13bn3wg,"For us it depends on where we’re going and whom we’re with. If we’re traveling with our kids we always stay in a hotel since it’s less hassle. But for example, it’s an adult only weekend in flagstaff with your 4 best friend/their spouses to 🍄 then you air b&b/vrbo!!",2023-05-09 03:08:20
13bn3wg,"Airbnb sucks. Fees. Places managed by property mgmt companies always have issues, gardener shows up in your bnb with floor to ceiling windows at 6am on a completely different day than announced. Hotels work. ✌🏾 out airbnb",2023-05-09 16:11:39
13bn3wg,"The last Airbnb we stayed in we found bedbugs crawling on the blanket on our wedding night. The host was awful to us! He suggested we were lying (so we saved the bug) and was very upset at us for contacting support. Then he even asked for a picture of our wedding certificate insinuating that we didn’t even get married that day and it was a ploy for a free stay. I spent an hour and a half going through every crevice of our bags and belongings before we left in the middle of the night to go to a hotel room. He later told us the exterminator confirmed it was a bug, but never apologized for his behavior and how aggressive he was both verbally, and in his delusion that we were lying about everything. Hotels 💯",2023-05-09 21:09:41
13bn3wg,"Good question, I tried Airbnb and honestly I miss the 24/7 service of hotels. I'm on a vacation to relax and to be pampered, and not to have to clean up and do self-service 😜",2023-05-12 20:01:22
13bn3wg,"This👆. But also if I’m renting an AirBNB, I only rent from Superhosts to reduce the chances of getting scammed",2023-05-09 05:18:58
13bn3wg,"I have lived next door to TWO illegal AirBNBs and I’ll tell you it’s a real problem. It’s very unsettling to never know who is 30 feet from your house. Are they going to be loud? Rude? One of the houses was fined $6,000 and continued to rent because they were pulling in more per month. I’ve had to call the cops multiple times. Who plays cornhole at 3am with music blaring? Who decided to rent to a motorcycle club and all of them let their bikes run at midnight for 20+ minutes? Mind you my bedroom is less than 10 feet from their back yard (weird layout in a squeezed tourist city) 

I’ve used Airbnb but I’m pretty jaded now 🤣",2023-05-09 15:06:42
13bn3wg,"Surprised I had to scroll so far to see an answer like this. Some cities Airbnb just makes more sense, in others a hotel is the most logical option. 

I do a shit ton of scoping out areas, reviews (on both units and owners), etc before booking anything anyway, so cost effectiveness is always a factor I consider from the start. 🤷‍♀️ I've had so many lovely stays with hosts, I can't imagine ditching the platform completely.",2023-05-08 16:15:51
13bn3wg,Yeah my last one we deep cleaned after being there for 4 days with a group in the rain and they complained about dust or something in a review on us. Like Wtf we deep cleaned despite staying in a place with 8 ppl during a monsoon. 🤣,2023-05-08 19:41:03
13bn3wg,I've had a lot of bad experiences even with the super hosts 🥲,2023-05-09 14:24:21
13bn3wg,"Exactly this!

Reading through the comments, either my settings only give me total price listings or in Australia you can't charge huge cleaning fees? Idk. I've never encountered an AirBnb that asked me to clean anything. 

But 100%, if I paid a cleaning fee, I am not cleaning anything! ✋🏼",2023-05-09 00:07:36
13bn3wg,"We have a tradition with this one couple we travel with often, we order pizza from a local shop as soon as we check in and then have it for when we get back late night so we aren’t scrambling to find food or eating our road snacks late night. Basically the reason why we do Air BnB with them. 😂",2023-05-08 17:17:49
13bn3wg,"Thank you. I looked at Extended Stay America and similar reviews in the area we need to be and pretty much they all said not to stay at those properties due to safety, maintenance, cleanliness etc.

7uxxqx,"Here's something cool I learned in architecture school... 


The Hagia Sophia was built by Romans in 537 as a church and later converted to a mosque when it was taken over by the Ottomans in the 1400's.. At the time there was not really a distinct architectural style for mosques and the Hagia Sophia/Byzantine architecture was used as inspiration. Over time mosque architecture built on these designs including more domes, larger open spaces for prayer and more intricate tile work. The blue mosque is significant because it is considered the culmination of these styles and the ~perfect~ example of Ottoman mosque architecture finished in 1616. 


I love that you can go to the Hagia Sophia and see the original inspiration and Christian influences. Then you can walk 200 yards to compare how the ottoman architects interpreted and changed what they saw at the Hagia Sophia over 200 years and how similar and different the two buildings are. The blue mosque is gorgeous, but without the Hagia Sophia so many of Istanbul's buildings just wouldn't be 😀",2018-02-03 15:19:57

I even came across a group still playing music and drinking from the night before. It’s a magical place Barcelona.",2019-09-22 14:28:12
d7oh4a,I met a pickpocket working in the early morning. He took a liking to me and waved off his partner. We ended up walking and talking as we moved toward the sea on the La Rambla. Best way to encounter a pickpocket! 😀,2019-09-22 21:38:48

13hmnlx,"I live in the US and totally agree with this assessment. 

We love Europe. Things we don’t like so the hot and cold water comes out of different spouts in the sink and I am baffled about why. Kids hated them. Public transportation is amazing. Food is better. Easier to walk (also mostly cooler which makes that easier).

13hmnlx,"* Nature - natural resources have always been the big selling point. 
* People are generally approachable and friendly - I think this changes depending on which area of the country you're in, but I also don't know anything about the Dutch in comparison.  

* Free refills - just 😂  

* Traffic lights across the street - weird to me that it would be any other way.  

* The doggy bag - I wouldn't have thought this was an issue anywhere. Is the resistance to taking home food a European thing or just in the Netherlands?  

* Tipping - Hard agree. I think most of us know this system isn't helpful and should be done away with.  

* The food, especially breakfast - there's a lot of variance, but we do overuse sugar (and salt) on top of having larger than needed portions.  

* Plastic - Again, hard agree. We need to do more to reduce our overuse on plastics, although we'll probably never be rid of them.  

* Imperial measurements - doesn't bother my day to day, but it would make more sense for there to be one international standard.",2023-05-14 20:52:19
13hmnlx,I was born here and remember when I was young everyone was so terrified of the “metric system” that they literally ditched it cuz they felt we were all too dumb to teach it to. Now I know both as I am in the medical field and I can’t believe they didn’t just change it. 😂,2023-05-14 21:16:32
13hmnlx,"What I like about Europe
1. Lifestyle.  Paid time off, less work hours, more leisure time, more connections with neighbors.
2. Incredibly fresh food 
3. Creative arts are highly valued, including people who choose an artistic trade such as stone sculpturing, making pottery with traditional (or non-traditional) hand painting, fiber arts, crafting works-class violins & guitars, handmade glass, etc. 
4. Incredible mass transit in cities and across Europe
5. Metric system ❤️

What I didn’t like: 
Some of the worse service I’ve ever received in restaurants. Zero incentive to provide excellent service because there is no tipping (or the percentage is built in to the bill and equal for everyone as a waiter, regardless of crappy service or not).",2023-05-14 21:44:34

13hmnlx,"Having been all over France, Brussels, Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Dubrovnik (2) and England a number of times - and all over the US including Wisconsin a number of times I feel safe in saying that not only are the cheeses and breads/dessert superior but the eggs and produce are also fresher and more flavorful. The worst wines in Croatia and Hungary are also considerably better than anything in Sonoma or WA.  After driving in both France, Swizt and Cotswolds - the drivers in Europe are so much more civilized.  Lastly - the chocolate anywhere in the world but of course Belgium - made the “junk” we call chocolate pretty taste pathetic.  I will give a shout out to a few WI cheeses; however - the overall selection of cheese options available in Europe is mind boggling.  Also, the bacon rashers in England are like filet mignon compared to the skinny pathetic little strips we call bacon in the US.  😉",2023-05-15 00:23:55

When we were visiting Amsterdam, we were having breakfast and asked for some of our order to go (it was taking too long, and we had to make a reservation at the Anne Frank House).

13hmnlx,"Let me just say, that if you have to go to a Michelin starred restaurant to eat well, then you're living in a place with ZERO CLUE ABOUT GASTRONOMY.  People here are obsessed with sticking as much food down their gullet in as short a time as possible.  In European countries, there is more of an emphasis placed on every aspect of eating.  Portions, order of consumption, etc.  You can find that in any restaurant in France, Italy, Spain,  etc.  I judge the cuisine of a people, by the people who eat it.  Have you seen the average European, vs the average American? BBQ, soul food, and Cajun, are some of the cuisines which are at the center of the American obesity crisis.  That's gastronomy?

zi9u6x,"Alright guys, buckle up for my HELL Airbnb cabin story! Please excuse my speedy story telling and plz ask if I need to clarify anything.

I was a highly rated guest with lots of experience and great reviews from other hosts. I had been using Airbnb since I was 18 since we couldnt book hotels until 21. My friends and I would book cabins and have a chill weekend with a few beers and maybe a smoke outside (we arent huge partiers, this was always like a once a year event that never got too rowdy). We always tried our best to be respectful to hosts, their homes, and always made sure to clean before we left! Even waking people up at 5am just to do dishes and vacuum whenever we did these stays so that there was no trace of us! Most of my experiences were great with amazing hosts. Here is the story that stopped our Airbnb adventures:

We booked a cabin on a lake in the north midwest. Mind you, this cabin had NO INDOOR PLUMBING, NO RUNNING WATER, and absolutely no shower on the premises. Only a gross outhouse in the woods. The best part of this airbnb was that it was on a quiet lake with a hot tub! My friends and I had a chill weekend, played boardgames, and overall relaxed. We had one fire (no fire pit, had to build one with rocks) and the creepy Karen neighbors stared us down the whole time. The only “damage” we did while we were there was when we were playing a chill boardgame at the table, someone was merely sitting on a chair and it broke. The space we were in was small and so simply sitting down and the chair breaking forced it into the wall. I was concerned for my friends safety as they almost got their butthole impaled by this wood chair! Mind you my friend merely sat down, we were in NO WAY being rowdy and definitely not drunk. This also left a SCRATCH on the LAMINATE floor and a small hole in the wall. It wasn’t our fault, we weren’t messing around-it simply collapsed like it was a fake chair! My friend weighed probably 120lbs at the time as well.  This cabin was still new construction/being renovated, and so there wasn’t even paint it was just sheetrock. Also, the kitchen sink was simply left on the ground inside and this guy decided to rent out his construction zone. The door on this place also wouldn’t shut, as I believe it wasn’t installed properly. Furthermore, he had left tons of food in this cabin and my one friend had made a pack of walmart burgers. This is everything that went “wrong” so to speak. Before we left, we made sure to clean the house as best we could. Everything was fine or so we thought.

I get a call from the host saying we DESTROYED his entire cabin! He claimed we broke the innards of his hot tub (how? No way?) and that the floor and hole we made were going to cost big $ to repair. This isn’t true as it was laminate floor and a small hole in the wall. He already had his construction stuff there so it would have cost little to nothing to fix. Mind you, the hole and scratch wouldn’t be there w/o his junk furniture that didn’t stand with one sitting. A detail I forgot to add: this cabin was TINY! In the end, he tried charging us $1300+ dollars! 

He tried to claim:

1. The depreciation of the floor board & saying he SHOULD charge us for replacing the whole floor because you cant replace one single piece of laminate?
2. That somehow his hot tub was “totally broken inside” (It was working fine?? Not even dirty, we had used it maybe 4 times all weekend) But of course he wanted to charge US to change the water too… shouldn’t you change the water with every set of guests?? This was when covid was still rampaging certain places-hence why we went out to the woods to escape the city. 
3. That his walmart burgers were worth $70 YEAH RIGHT
4. He claimed there was spilled soda underneath the couch? Idk how this happened as we all drank outside 🤔and the place was spotless when we left. 
5. Apparently someone “poured liquid” down his NOT WORKING/NOT HOOKED UP sink and it had leaked everywhere. Again- this sink was on the floor, we would have seen this if it was the case. 
6. Tried to say we were ungodly dirty. Fella, we booked a cabin for how many days in the middle of the WOODS with no running water, how clean do you expect us to be? And yes the hot tub water was probably sweaty but HE DIDN’T HAVE A SHOWER OR ANY WATER RUNNING on the property. 
7. The man called me and stated “I thought this was a girls Kumbaya weekend” and that he wouldn’t have rented it out to just “students” . Creepy af because he was mad men were there too. He said if he knew it was a mixed group he wouldn’t have rented to us. He must not know names very well because I explicitly included ALL my guests names in the booking. Also tried to claim I had a huge party which I obv did not (…thanks Karen neighbors) But this lead me to believe that he only wants females staying in his cabin in the woods? 🤔


Over all, this guy was a failure wannabe fixer-upper that got scammed by his contractors and tried making up the money by letting people rent out his sh!tty construction project and charging people ridiculous fees that I stg he set up! You should not be allowed to charge a cleaning FEE when we cant even wash our own bodies. Im sorry thats just a trap. 

I called Airbnb and disputed this claim. Airbnb had no problem letting me off to which I was surprised… people must have called about this guy before. It took less than 5 seconds for the customer support to remove the $1300 charge This guy clearly was tired of living in a construction project (and had obv paid contractors wayyy too much money to install this laminate floor for this tiny place, he claimed it cost him tens of thousands for a space smaller than my apts bedroom, yeah right) In the end I ended up paying nothing and simply never using Airbnb again. Evil hosts are trying to rig up fee traps and make people pay for ridiculous cleaning fees if the slightest things arent *perfect*. Long story short, if youre uncomfortable with people using your space, DONT RENT OUT YOUR SPACE!!! I cannot stress this enough. 


TL;DR - Friends and I rented an airbnb w NO running water, easy to break furniture, and host tried to charge us ridiculous cleaning fees ($1300+) for a rigged house setup to make us pay fees!",2022-12-11 16:42:05

zi9u6x,"I had a long term rental as a stacked duplex in a cute historic district. When my downstairs tenants bought a home and moved after 5 years, and because my husband was retiring, I listed that apartment on Airbnb. I had some horrible guests in the beginning. I found that when I raised my nightly rate a bit that attracted a better level guest. 
I did all the laundry and cleaning myself because I KNEW it was actually very clean. I charged a $75 cleaning fee because that’s what I needed to not cop a resentment. Haha. I charged this to even friends and family because = no resentment. 
I have been a guest at a dozen Airbnbs all in the US. I have never once found one that was clean like mine. Or decorated stylish, with well thought out amenities. I feel like I thought of everything. I retained SuperHost the entire time, 6 1/2 years. I sold in July 2020 as a turnkey business to friends. 
I made 2-3x the $ as a STR vs LTR but it was 10x the work and stress. Grateful for the experience and much needed $$ but so glad it’s behind me. 
I am done w being a guest @ Airbnb as it’s just not as comfortable as a nice hotel. I ALWAYS have to buy and replace the clogged, nasty AC filter 🤢, sanitize the moldy shower, mop the floors properly…before I sleep there. Just ridiculous. 
I’ve come to hate travel because I am highly reactive to fragrance products (laundry, plug-ins, etc) Every Airbnb I’ve stayed at has some crap like Downy  fabric softener or Glade in the place. Might as well smoke cigarettes inside!
Hotels never use this stuff. 
It’s a great original business model and a way for many property owners to keep up w rising costs like insurance and taxes. But I agree that when the investor sector got involved it got impersonal and weird. Maybe the cool and awesome hosts could find a new place to list?",2022-12-11 10:19:16

lf6eaz,"Haha, great questions.  Beaches are subjective.  I tend to prefer calm, clear turquoise water and soft white sand.  Seaweed and rocks are a big no-no in my rating system.  I also enjoy a quiet beach to a crowded one with many bars and crowds, but I don’t typically factor in ease of access... in fact, remoteness is usually a plus for me. 😀

And for your dream trip... Seychelles is a great choice, you’ll love it.  Some of the finest beaches on the planet, and there’s more to do than just water activities (unlike the Maldives).  I recommend Praslin Island especially.

Bermuda has my favorite beach, and spectacular beaches in general, but it’s just as expensive.  Bermuda is also best visited in summer (May-Oct), it can be chilly in the off-season.",2021-02-08 09:45:59

I was in Aruba in 2014.  Sorry; not sure about any changes.  Aruba isn’t famous for visibility but Eagle Beach is (or was in 2014) a fantastic beach nonetheless.

Personally my recommendation would be based on what time of year you plan to go.  In the summer season, Aruba is best because of the reliably sunny and Hurricane-free weather.  In the winter, I think you’d be better off in USVI, it is a really nice place with great beaches. 😊

lf6eaz,Amazing place to propose!  Congrats and good choice 😊,2021-02-08 22:09:36
lf6eaz,"Thanks. I started an online marketing business in 2012 that has become fairly successful (partly thanks to hard work, but also partly thanks to good luck/timing).  In 2014 I started to enjoy a healthy disposable income that, combined with the flexibility of being self-employed and able to work from anywhere there’s WiFi, allowed my wife and I to spend a few months of the year traveling.  We usually (pre-COVID) tried to do 3-4 major 2 or 3 week trips per year.  

You don’t need to be rich to travel to most of these places, aside from perhaps Maldives and French Polynesia.  If you’re smart with your budget and don’t mind sacrificing fancy hotels/restaurants, you can probably visit any beach you fancy by saving for a few months.  I recommend SE Asia or Central America if you’re on a tight budget, your $$ goes much further than in luxe destinations like Seychelles or Maldives. 

If you’re going to splurge on one dream paradise destination, I recommend French Polynesia.  😅

lf6eaz,"Good question.  Of all the beaches I’ve ever been to, the warmest was probably the Persian Gulf (Abu Dhabi, UAE).  

In summer, the Sea of Cortez can also get super warm, especially in shallow bays.  90°F water temps in August and Sept are not unheard of.

Of the ones pictured in my OP, it’s probably the Maldives or Seychelles.  The Indian Ocean tends to be a bit warmer than other places at the same latitude.  I wouldn’t say there’s much noticeable difference between any of the beaches in the tropics though, just a degree or two.  Caribbean, South Pacific, Indian Ocean... all very comfortable to swim in for hours without a wetsuit.

Hawaii is a bit cooler, same with Bermuda and the Med.  The Atlantic coast of Europe (ie. Algarve) is cold as hell, and the Pacific Northwest requires a 5mm wetsuit in summer and maybe even a drysuit for longer exposure in winter.

The coldest is easily the Southern Ocean, i briefly jumped off my cruise ship in the Antarctic as icebergs floated by.  Shockingly cold to the point of being a safety hazard even with a 10-second dip; took my testicles months to re-appear after that 😂",2021-02-09 06:01:05

I don't know how it will be these dates but I'm sure there will be people there.  Is more visited than Istanbul. I would go exactly to the same hostel I went. You have the link in the previous comments. I booked te balloon trip with them on arrival. But I'm sure you can contact them to book it earlier 🙂 have fun! And post pictures after going there!

8rdph1,"Fez is green, as far as I can remember from my two visits. The green roofs from the mosque shine. I’ll double check with my mother-in-law, she’s from there originally

Edit: checked and confirmed: Fez is green. 

I’ll have to agree, Casa is worth skipping. A big industrial and harbour city. The mosque is impressive indeed, a big place build partly over the sea. It has a roof that can slide open like a stadium, escalators and a laser in the top that points to Mecca in the night. It’s open for non-muslims to visit on few hours and days.

I’ve been in Morocco a few times now (my in-laws have houses there in Berkane and  Saïdia), and there are better and nicer places to see. 

I even dare to say skip Marrakech, but for a first visit a good way to experience the country (It’s like saying you’ve been to New York or Las Vegas, so you’ve experienced America (or been in Paris so you’ve experienced France).

Meknes for example, also one of the seven kings-cities. And close to that, Volubulis, a huge Roman city ruin you can visit. Next to that, Mulay Idriss (sorry for typos). Then the trip from Marrakech to Ourzazate through the high and low Atlas mountains (see movie Babel, the bustrip). And Ourzazate itself with its filmstudios practically next to the road. From there the trip to Zagora through the valley of Dades.

Then there is the coast at Rabat, the small village on top of the coastal rock, the souk (market). Fez is great in the old medina, but advised to do with a guide.

However, I am fortunate to be able to travel there with my wife who speaks the language and knows the habits, which helps a lot in a country where locals don’t speak English a lot, a little French maybe, but mostly Arabic. Still, would recommend 😁  

TL;DR : go visit Morocco, skip Casablanca, hire a tourguide.

6jnal4,Well If you'll be on Bled make sure you check Bohinj and Bohinjsko jezero aswell. It's a few minutes drive by car. I find Bohinj far more beautiful. And if you are into hiking you have loads of hiking trips from Bohinj. Raging from an easy 1h-2h hike to a more challenging 2 day hikes one of witch is our highest mountain Triglav where you have one of the most beautiful views I've ever seen. But make sure you are prepared for that one. Enjoy your stay in Slovenia 😀,2017-06-27 07:51:03

ak0t5z,"I've been going to Zermatt every winter since I was 3 and highly recommended Chesa Valese, it's in the village but close enough to the end of the slopes that most years it snows enough to be able to ski in and ski out (with some pushing as you go along the streets, though!), it's walking distance to the quick lift up to the slopes (you can take a bus to get to the Gornergrat train), and it's small and family-tun so very friendly, cozy and not too expensive - for Zermatt standards at least 😄",2019-01-26 16:27:44

Say, would a fair, blonde male get too much attention, if so which kind? Meaning that everywhere I go, people would try to either make acquaintance, either haggle or almost go as far as  harassing etc..? 🤔 What's the mentality towards us?

uwf134,"As the title says, I was lucky enough to visit a vast majority of the National Parks in the contiguous United States over 2020-2021. And as there are 423 sites in the whole of the National Parks Service, I visited a ton of those, too! Some of the Monuments, Seashores, Lakeshores, and Historic Parks are actually among my favorite sites.

The first part of these visits was a seven month RV trip with my partner and two small children during the pre-vax election-time hellscape. We logged over 13,000 RV miles and an additional 10,000 Jeep miles. As we were being insanely careful, cautious and respectful, we stayed in our RV cocoon and gave our kids as much outdoor time as possible. No better way than seeing 29 NP’s, as well as a bunch of state parks, other NPS sites, and other nature-related activities.

The second half was a gig I got for a company that had me traveling the U.S. by van for another four months, solo. This is where I got to experience the rest of the parks I visited and logged another 15,000 miles.The only Lower 48 NP’s I wasn’t able to visit were: Lassen Volcanic, due to the fire that shut down the park; Isle Royale, due to this being a pretty difficult park to get to, and by the time I was in that area of the country, the whole place was basically shut down for the season; and, for no good reason whatsoever— Channel Islands and Pinnacles. Which is ridiculous, because I have lived in California most of my life, and not visited these very close parks.

Below are the National Parks I did visit, with \* next to my favorites. “Favorites” is so wildly subjective- nearly all of these parks are worth a visit, and a lot of my “favorites” are due to personal experience, not “which park is the most impressive”:

Acadia (Maine)

Arches  (Utah)

\*Badlands (South Dakota)

Big Bend (Texas)

Biscayne (Florida)

Black Canyon of the Gunnison (Colorado)

\*Bryce Canyon (Utah)

Canyonlands (Utah)

\*Capitol Reef (Utah)

Carlsbad Caverns (New Mexico)

Congaree (South Carolina)

\*Crater Lake (Oregon)

Cuyahoga Valley (Ohio)

\*Death Valley (California/NV)

Dry Tortugas (Florida)

Everglades (Florida)

Gateway Arch (Missouri)

\*Glacier (Montana)

Grand Canyon (Arizona)

\*Grand Teton (Wyoming)

Great Basin (Nevada)

Great Sand Dunes (Colorado)

Great Smoky Mountains (Tennessee/NC)

Guadalupe Mountains (Texas)

Hot Springs (Arkansas)

Indiana Dunes (Indiana)

Joshua Tree (California)

Kings Canyon (California)

Mammoth Cave (Kentucky)

Mesa Verde (Colorado)

\*Mount Rainier (Washington)

New River Gorge (West Virginia)

\*North Cascades (Washington)

Olympic (Washington)

Petrified Forest (Arizona)

Redwood (California)

Rocky Mountain (Colorado)

Saguaro (Arizona)

Sequoia (California)

Shenandoah (Virginia)

\*Theodore Roosevelt (North Dakota)

Voyageurs (Minnesota)

White Sands (New Mexico)

Wind Cave (South Dakota)

\*Yellowstone (Wyoming/MT/ID)

Yosemite (California)

Zion (Utah)

And here are some of the other NPS sites I highly recommend making time to visit, especially as a ‘tack-on’ to an already existing trip in the general area:

Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (Wisconsin)

Assateague Island National Seashore (Maryland)

Cape Cod National Seashore (Massachusetts)

Cape Hatteras National Seashore (North Carolina)

Devil’s Tower National Monument (Wyoming)

Gulf Islands National Seashore (Florida/Mississippi)

Harper’s Ferry National Historic Park (West Virginia)

Manzanar National Historic Site (California)

Muir Woods National Monument (California)

National Mall (Washington, D.C.)

Natural Bridges National Monument (Utah)

Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (Michigan)

Point Reyes National Seashore (California)

Finally- getting an Annual Park Pass is the best purchase I’ve ever made. My family and I went to everything listed here, plus a ton more for literally $80. If you’re in the U.S.— check out the NPS map. There is sure to be a site near you. I truly believe the Parks are “America’s Best idea” and I hope we continue to protect them for everyone. And of course, if you do go, please practice the LEAVE NO TRACE guidance and leave these amazing places better than you found them. The Visitor Centers and Park Ranges are universally excellent and can guide you to everything you can and cannot do in the parks.

The photos I selected are hopefully a good sampling of a few of the more popular parks, mixed in with some of the lesser known (and thus much less crowded!) ones. If you want to check out more photos, my IG is quizkidpictures ... I’ve posted a lot from most of these parks, as well as many other places along my travels.

I am happy to answer any questions about my experiences and travels in the comments here!

&#x200B;

*Edit: Obligatory thanks for the Gold! And Silver! And ""Wholesome"" awards, etc. Nice to see folks here have an interest in these photos and the parks! My usual posts on Instagram only get about 600 views total, and this has nearly 300k in half a day... Hmm, maybe I should be posting more on Reddit? 🤷🏻‍♂️😂 If there are other aspects of the United States you'd like to see a series of, let me know and I'll try to get that together for sharing here.

9qehln,Same thing happened the morning I left there for Florence last year. Unfortunately some people died from flooding😬. Changes the city in an instant.,2018-10-23 03:18:50
9qehln,"Yes! My school (John Cabot U) was in Trastevere so it’s where I spent the most time. 

Not sure if you have been to Italy before but basically there are two kinds of pizza. There’s sit-down restaurant pizzerias where everybody typically order’s their own pizza. The best of these restaurants in Trastevere is called Dar Poeta. 

The second kind of pizza is called pizza al taglia (cut pizza) which is the kind you pick up at a counter and take with you. There are many rectangles of pizza of various types on display and you just point to the one you want and they cut it and charge you by weight. These places also have Supli (called arancini in the rest of Italy) which is a ball of rice and red sauce with a center of fresh mozzarella, breaded and fried. Highly recommend. I found that this kind of pizza is consistently delicious no matter where you get it from but we mostly stuck to the shops in and around Piazza Trilussa. We’d take it to the piazza and sit on the steps while we ate. Great for peoplewatching!

Carbonara is the pasta specialty of Rome, and the best I had while I was there was at a restaurant called Da Carlone. They also have terrific cacio e pepe if there are any non meat-eaters in your party. 

Spend an afternoon or evening in Piazza Santa Maria. There are always a variety of street performers and they are always enthusiastic and entertaining. 

Unfortunately I can’t speak to much of the nightlife, as I was a broke American student so I mostly hung out at the cheap college bars frequented by other students in my program. There was one place I do remember called Vendita Libri, Cioccolata e Vino that serves alcoholic dessert shots in a chocolate shot glass that’s a lot of fun. We also went to Birreria Trilussa fairly often, they serve beer towers for a good price. I seem to remember going there for happy hour a lot. 

IMO, the Roman Forum is far more diverse and interesting to see than the Colosseum and deserves more of your time. When I was there, the basic ticket was a bundle for both sites since they are adjacent to each other. If you are in this area, be prepared to encounter vendors selling everything you never knew you didn’t need. This goes for Pantheon, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain,  and Piazza Navona to a lesser extent. 

Don’t take busses unless you are not worried about being late, as they are completely unreliable. The tram that runs up Viale Trastevere and across Ponte Garibaldi is a different story, and will take you right to the Wedding Cake (Vittorio Emanuele monument) which is a walk away from most of the other landmarks. 

Don’t skip Largo di Torre Argentina! It is adjacent to the former site of the Theater of Pompey, where Caesar was murdered, and is now a four-square-block sanctuary for stray cats. Many a drunk evening was spent watching the cats interact with each other and petting the occasional cat that would brave the borders. 

Fanta in Italy is not orange soda but aranciata, italian soda like san pellegrino. 
Always delicious, especially during a long day of sightseeing. Similarly, yellow fanta is limonata. 

Don’t cross Ponte Sisto later than like 10PM unless you’re looking to buy weed. It gets especially sketchy after 1AM. If you find yourself north of the river, take the tram or walk across Ponte Garibaldi. 

I will add more as I think of them ☺️

EDIT: I haven’t been but my buddy who I went with recently returned to Rome, and he and his girlfriend went to a restaurant called Trattoria ser Palaro that they absolutely adored. It’s a fixed menu so you get whatever they’re making for the full traditional multi-course Italian meal. Cooked and served by a woman known as “Nonna di Roma”, who you’d swear has always been your grandma. ",2018-10-22 21:26:48

Update: holy crap, I can’t believe the reception this is getting! Thank you all for your kind words. It is truly appreciated

We randomly crossed paths in a hostel. One of his traveling companions was from the same area as me in California and he noticed that I was wearing a baseball cap from a local team. I ended up hanging out with them the rest of the day. It wasn’t until later that night when he had to leave to catch a flight that we really clicked and sparks flew 😊 Funny enough,  I ended up seeing him again in Amsterdam so it was definitely fate! When we got back to the states, we knew we had to be together. We lived in different states so it was hard to see each other. We couldn’t stand being apart so he packed up his stuff and moved across the country to California and it has led up to this ☺️

9ln8dz,"Thank you for sharing this! I've been on the road the last year and a half, solo. It's been amazing and I'm so glad I get to do this alone but it does get lonely sometimes. I'm currently in Australia and living in a hostel for a bit. I've met some amazing people and one of them is someone who I see as my beat friend now. Her and I have had our ups and downs with meeting guys at the hostel but through it all we have our friendship.

We were chatting about how one day we will meet someone that the feelings will be mutual with. That they will want to be with us as much as we will want to be with them. We've also been discovering how important it is that we do not make our lives about finding a partner but about following OUR dreams...  love will come one day.

I'm blabbering, sorry, haha. This just really hit home right now with the fact that when you find someone and the sparks are there it will be undeniable. And until then I'm focusing my love and energy on the people who bring the most into my life, like my friends and family.

I wish you all the best in your life together!! Congratulations 💖",2018-10-05 20:15:35

uawg9j,"A couple days ago I checked out at a grocery store and there was an option to tip, so I did out of reflex 😳 tipping culture in America is definitely getting out of control and I wish it wasn’t this way.",2022-04-24 16:29:17
uawg9j,"The tipping ""culture"" here has gone mad. Seems like everywhere at the register now has an option to add a tip. I be sure to put 0 in the tip slot and where it says ""total"" on the receipt to write the flat price so they can't do something sneaky like add it in after. Which has happened to me. I'm not tipping anyone if I'm getting take out or buying goods. 

I think a lot of it is the generic PoS software a lot of businesses used now just have a tip thing built into the program/app by default for a wider array of businesses. Places I would never tip ever often have it as an option because everyone now seems to used this same iPad based PoS app. 

The only people I tip (in the US) are my servers at a restaurant, my bar tender, UBER driver and food delivery people. That is it. 

That being said, I used to work as a tow truck driver mostly doing roadside assistance. Tipping wasn't required or expected, but I provided good and fast service and holy shit people tipped me a lot. Not like I'm gonna say no. 🤷‍♂️ Biggest one I ever got was $500 cuz I managed to get this rich dude in his Bentley with a flat tire back home in time for him to grab his spare Bentley so he could make it to Miami on time for whatever the fuck he had going on lol. 

Although now I live in Japan and tipping really isn't much of a thing here. It's so nice.",2022-04-25 08:33:31
uawg9j,"it's not tipping 😂 a tip is a reward for extraordinary service, not a base pay subsidized by the customer while their boss steals their wages. 

miss me with that shit.",2022-04-25 01:26:02

uawg9j,"Yes, the UK pays folks and has health insurance. Grocery staff can sit and you bag your own groceries, but they are chill and paid a living wage with good benefits. Most people in the US are not paid a living wage, (which is wrong) So if you can afford to go out it is expected you will also plan to tip. The fucked up thing is that the wealthiest people are generally stingy af with their tips too. It’s gonna hot a breaking point soon (read: already has). 👀",2022-04-25 04:18:48

Edit: I’ve been to New York, Washington and Miami on my trip. Being a pedestrian wasn’t soo bad but we did feel kinda alone, especially in Miami. 
What surprised me also was the horrible Subway system in New York which was filthy and outdated. But I guess I’m just too spoiled with a functioning public transport system in Germany 🤣",2022-04-24 17:37:48

But does that replace the tipping or is that still in addition expected?",2022-04-24 21:21:56
uawg9j,I’m in Cabo right now and this has not been my experience.  Name the restaurant so we can avoid it 😅,2022-04-24 16:21:47
uawg9j,"I totally agree with you. Cost of living in the US is more expensive compared to most countries and if you happen to live in a big city like New York, DC, San Francisco etc., your expenses quadruple. Whenever we travel abroad, we always spend less than we budget for and I am not talking about being cheap either. I vuess we get to keep our tips😂😂.  The food, lodging, rentals, etc, everything is way cheaper and the food is of better quality too. Tipping culture is so deep rooted that eradicating it would take a few generations down the road. The sad part is if you don't tip, you are not hurting the big companies that make all the money but rather the poor chap who is putting in a hard day's work just to collect ""pennies"" on the dollar. COVID is terrible but one good thing that came out of that is people waking up and realizing they dont have to stay at their shitty serving job making $3 an hour and looking for something that pays at least the minimum wage.  Then again no one was going out to eat so that helped a bit also. I am generous at restaurants and always go over 20% if possible because my fiancee used to wait tables after college and she would vent about how shitty of a job it was and how rude, stupid, and entitled some people can be only to leave her a dollar as a tip after spending 2 hours bringing them food and drinks. Tough times. 

 Normally, (and this is just me) you tip the bellhop over the concierge because I can bet my last dollar, the bellhop makes less money compared to the receptionist.",2022-04-24 15:31:33

9tt3j8,">	Are you a local or just really knowledgeable about the area?

Yes, I’m local, I live in Naples, my fantastic english is an evidence. 

>	Was finding the choice of ports super confusing too lol. I guess I will take a smaller suitcase just for ease of movement, and probably aim for Beverello if it’s the easiest from the airport

Sadly, the metro station of the airport in Naples is still closed. 
The only two options are 1) A specific airport bus shuttle (Alibus), you can buy the ticket online for 5€ 2) Taxi, which costs about 20-25€ from airport to port.

Alibus make 3 stops one in the main train station of Naples and two in both ports, Calata di Massa and Beverello. So from the airport these two ports are easy to reach with the same bus.
When I said Beverello is better, I meant from the city center, because Beverello has also a metro station, while the metro station of Calata di Massa is 10 min away walking.

About tickets, keep in mind that if it’s one of the most crowded moments in summer (tipically week ends on June-July and all August) and you are planning to depart from Ischia in the afternoon or evening, it’s a good idea going to the port the previous day or during the morning and buying tickets in advance, above all if you’re going to use the hydrofoils (ferries are rarely full). You wouldn’t be stuck on the isle for an extra day. Locals often during week ends spend a single day in Ischia, so locals+tourists can make hard finding tickets minutes before of the departure for departures in late afternoon/evening.

I forgot to say another couple of facts that you could consider for a better choice: 1) on ferries you can stay both in the cabin or outside, enjoying the landscape, while on hydrofoils you can only stay in the cabin. 2) when the weathear is not good, hydrofoils departures are cancelled. Instead you can always enjoy a storm on the ferry! /s

>	Any food treats I should check out when I’m there, besides the excellent pizza? I’ve heard rabbit is a speciality on Ischia. Thank you once again, I really appreciate it!

In Ischia the main speciality is the rabbit “Ischitano”, which basically it’s a ragù with rabbit. You can eat both pasta with this ragù and the rabbit itself. Strongly recommended. Personally the best one I tried is [Ristorante Bracconiere](https://www.tripadvisor.it/Restaurant_Review-g580215-d1760776-Reviews-Bracconiere-Serrara_Fontana_Isola_d_Ischia_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html?m=19905), but for sure it is not the only one.

In Ischia there is also a famous bakery, [Calise](https://www.tripadvisor.it/Restaurant_Review-g580214-d3576905-Reviews-Calise-Ischia_Isola_d_Ischia_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html?m=19905). Everyone seems to be crazy for its ice creams and desserts. I think that it’s too expensive. For sure, tourists find it delicious, maybe they think it worths, but you can have the same things for half of the price everywhere in Naples and maybe also somewhere in Ischia. Anyway, the food is good.

In Ischia a lot of restaurants make good fish, especially with pasta. For example [pasta with beans and  mussels -fagioli e cozze in Italian-](https://images-3662.kxcdn.com/fidelitynews/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/05/1495783461_699936631c04f390f0e3e8a7634e9ad2e98908b4-1470811211.png?w=580), is a regional speciality. 
Also Mozzarella is a regional speciality, you can try it in restaurants as a starter or you can buy it in all grocery stores, especially the smaller ones. Anyway if you buy it in a grocery, do not confuse the [“fresh” mozzarella di bufala](http://www.bontacampane.com/69-large_default/mozzarella-di-bufala-da-100-gr.jpg), often sold as it is, they put it in a bag at the moment when you ask for it, with 
[industrial mozzarella cheese made by italian brands](https://www.dissapore.com/wp-content/uploads/photo120.jpg), which is basically a cheese, that you can buy everywhere in the world, and it has nothing to do with the real mozzarella (it’s like you say that bread+tomato sauce is a pizza 😡).
Pizza in Ischia is usually an average Italian pizza, sadly you can try the original pizza made like in Naples only in Naples lol

In Naples, the main specialities are pizza (best one: Michele pizzeria, in the old town), [Babbà and its variants with cream or chocolate or fruit](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/44/b4/ac/sfogliatelle-e-babba.jpg) (best one: Capparelli, in old tow) and 
[sfogliatella - riccia variant, on the right, or frolla variant, on the left-](https://www.napolidavivere.it/wp-content/uploads/bfi_thumb/Notte-Bianca-della-Sfogliatella-al-Museo-ferroviario-di-Pietrarsa-6in190yapknep665p2uuz1lytdj7y130bmn0gl73np0.jpg) (best one: Attanasio).


Anyway all these specialities can be found also in Ischia, maybe not as good as the original ones but anyway quite good! So give it a try, even if you do not spend any time in Naples. 

If you go to Sorrento/Amalfi/Capri too, two specialities are [delizia al limone ](https://www.hovogliadidolce.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Delizie-al-limone-costiera-Sorrentino-ricetta.jpg) and
[chocolat Caprese](http://foodloversodyssey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Torta-Caprese-Flourless-Chocolate-Cake.jpg) or 
[lemon Caprese](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7o_DwMMifuY/VQx2n-7iJGI/AAAAAAAATEw/6EXif_Mj8-k/s1600/capreseb1.jpg).


Finally, if you come in a period included from April to October, do not forget to visit Poseidon thermal baths in Ischia. It’s a very famous and beautiful place, maybe the main attraction in Ischia. There are thermal baths, but also a beach+sea, so you can try both. You can buy tickets for a single day or packages with many days or extra services like SPA on the [official site](http://www.giardiniposeidonterme.com/en).

Anyway PM me if in the future more questions will come to your mind.

PS: Last but boring tip: I’m a physician and a subscriber of the [Help a Dane campaign](https://www.helpadane.com), but this is valid for all “extremely white” people from the cold and far North: sun in Italy can be twice stronger than in Denmark or Canada and so on. So, if it’s your case, please don’t forget the sunscreen. You can’t imagine how many tourists in Italy become totally red, cooked by the sun, and I often see them in my hospital during the summer. Please stay white.",2018-11-04 13:44:54

l7llaz,Thank you! 🙏🏼,2021-01-29 08:39:17
l7llaz,"Thanks!

Yeah we rented a car in Oslo and drove to Bergen, then flew to Tromsø and rented another car there which we drove to Leknes airport in Lofoten.  Both one way rentals, so it was pricey, but I got a pair of nice new Volvo XC-60’s out of it. 😅

Driving in northern Norway in winter is maybe a bit much for an inexperienced snow driver. I am from Canada and drive snowy mountain roads regularly so I didn’t have any issues, and if you have basic winter driving skills and winter tires on a rental it’s generally no problem.  Don’t speed in Norway, cameras are everywhere.",2021-01-29 10:41:06
l7llaz,"I used to be the same way, always going to beach/tropical destinations, and they are really enjoyable for a laid back relaxing trip... but in the past few years we’ve done more active outdoor trips to Norway, Patagonia, New Zealand, etc.... and now I’m sold.

l7llaz,"I have been carrying around a nice SLR and lenses on all my travels for 6-7 years now, but finally decided to try an entire trip with just my phone camera.  

Aside from capturing very low light scenes (ie. Aurora) or shooting wildlife that requires a fast zoom lens, i find new iPhone cameras to be sufficient most of the time... I do miss RAW editing capabilities occasionally but not having to lug around heavy lenses and tripods easily makes up for that imo. 

Can’t wait until phone cameras improve even further, then they will really make SLR’s unnecessary for anyone but pro photographers.  

Just my 2 cents. 😊",2021-01-29 21:33:27
l7llaz,Thanks! Hope you make it there soon 👍🏾👍🏾,2021-01-30 04:27:56
l7llaz,"LOL. If anyone at Apple wants to send me some money, I would graciously accept. 

I only mentioned that the pics were taken on my phone because many of the photos posted in this sub are very professional shots taken with high-end gear, but the scenery in northern Norway is so stunning that even an amateur like me with a decent smartphone can capture some nice shots.

I actually suspect there are other phones that have even better cameras anyway.  I do love the newest iPhone camera a lot, but it’s not the reason I captured some nice photos... that credit goes to the scenery and landscapes of Norway 👍🏾",2021-01-30 04:37:46
l7llaz,Thanks! Me too....💗,2021-01-30 04:40:21
l7llaz,"No stand or tripod was used actually... in fact, I didn’t use any other gear or apps except the basic phone camera.

The “Live Photo” feature is really useful for capturing moving subjects (like the eagle photo in my OP) and enhancing dynamic range  in landscape photos.  I also never zoom in beyond the phone’s 2x optical zoom ability, as that really destroys details and adds noise.

Otherwise, I just open the camera app, and press the shutter button. 😀",2021-01-30 21:32:30
l7llaz,"Yes, I adore Iceland, I have been 3 times in the past 4 years haha.  This was my first trip to Norway.  

Neither will disappoint, especially if you like the outdoors/nature/scenery. 🙂",2021-01-30 09:45:33
l7llaz,"Cool, I love New Zealand, we did a similar trip in 2018.

Except for maybe the very most popular tourist like the Queenstown / Wanaka area, Norway is significantly more expensive than NZ, unfortunately.  Especially food and booze, which are probably double what they cost in NZ. 

If you can afford a month in NZ, though, I’m sure you can also afford a couple of weeks in Norway.  Especially if you don’t mind eating $8 gas station hot dogs for lunch every day 😂",2021-01-29 21:21:11
l7llaz,Indeed. Would hate to be a guide taking clueless tourists on aurora safaris and have to explain that all their expectations were completely unrealistic 😂,2021-01-30 04:46:37

I'd rather wait 2 hours in a line to have a moment alone to look at the painting than be trampled in a swarm of tourists like this.

1. We started in San Francisco.  

2. In California. You can buy tiny bikes in Colombia, too. More of a hassle crossing borders though. And they're tiny!  

3. That's a very long post of its own, [I wrote up the shipping process here.](https://advrider.com/f/threads/ride-south-⬇%EF%B8%8F%C2%96-in-colombia-san-francisco-to-patagonia-on-an-r-ninet-hp2-enduro.1108032/page-10) tldr: you need to legalize your bike in every country with a temporary vehicle import permit and at times mandatory insurance. Leave before your permit runs out, or else...

4. a year? Or more.

5. No idea yet!",2019-04-29 11:18:46

The rest are &Beyond, Sossusvlei lodge and in Botswana we will be at Sandibe Lodge, Chobe Under Canvas and Xaranna. In Victoria Falls it’s a lodge called Mpala Jena. 

Did you drive between locations in Namibia? We decided to splurge and fly because of time restraints. Pricey trip for sure but once in a lifetime. Although we aren’t going to Etosha due to time and having plenty of game drives in Bots so I’d like to come back one day for that reason.

Having been to Lanzarote, Gran Canaria (and Madeira + Porto Santo in the same region), they often transport sand from the Sahara to create manmade beaches ☺️ the islands sit in the Atlantic and the water is very deep and quite rough (nowhere near as swimmable as the Mediterranean).

It’s a 7 hour flight from Newark so not bad as it’s overnight. 

You are correct that the Canaries are not on the radar of most Americans. Source - people asking me Where the heck is that 🤣

Not so fun fact one of the worst airline collisions in aviation history took place on Tenerife between a Pan Am 747 and KLM 747 on March 27, 1977 ☹️

grh7vw,"Honestly, I loved it in South Carolina best. I don't like a lot of their positions on God, politics, guns etc, but that's something I try to avoid discussing anyway. 

Leaving aside the social conservatism, they were the sweetest, friendliest people I ever met in my life. They would do anything for you and they never needed an excuse for a get together, or party. 

My whole neighbourhood would meet up most nights, in the street, and sit together and drink a few beers, shoot the breeze, and watch all of our kids playing together in the street and in each other's gardens/houses. We were always having cookouts and buffets, and parties together. 

The entire local community was so nice, and you really became part of the wider community with ease. There was so much great stuff to do there, in terms of entertainment, restaurants, shopping, and twice a week there was a kind of street festival along main street; the were bouncy slides, street food vendors, street beer stalls, live music in the street etc. This was in Greenville, South Carolina by the way, and I lived in the burbs (Simpsonville).

The surrounding area was scenically stunning too, with tree covered mountains, lots of lakes (with the usual public beaches, barbeque area with picnic tables etc). I was often invited to the lake with my neighbours for the weekend, as one of them was frequently allowed to use a friends lake house, and my neighbour had a boat. Adults and kids alike had a great time. Lots of good memories,  and I wish that we had been able to stay there. 

I also lived in Colorado Springs, literally just below Cheyenne mountain (NORAD). I liked it there too, as the scenery was just breathtaking, but I found that the people kept to themselves, to the point that it was virtually impossible to get to know anyone. I felt isolated there. 

I lived in Burnsville, Minnesota which was about 20 minutes outside Minneapolis/St Paul. My daughter was born there, but there were similar issues there around people keeping to themselves, and me feeling isolated. I'm also terrible with the cold, and I hate snow; so no surprise that when we were offered the move to South Carolina, I jumped at it. I knew nothing about the area, at the time, other than it had a much better climate. I was fortunate, once there, to realise that Greenville was an amazing place to be. 

Anyway, I'm going to stop rambling now, so that's my story. I would only encourage you, if you have the opportunity, to visit Greenville for a long weekend or something. From June onwards, the street festivals would happen from early evening onwards, on Thursday and Friday night. I hear that Greenville is now appearing on those ""Top 10 lists"" of best places to visit, and though it's smallish, it's perfectly formed.

Peace out.🤟",2020-05-28 11:25:11

It is off season now and not many people know abou this, so you'd probably be by yourself too. 

Also, when in the Forum, try to look for a single stone block to the right on the main via, depicting (very faded) a knight with spear and shield...

q7lwtx,">Anyone who’s been to both, could you compare Marrakech (esp old town) to Egypt/Cairo/Alex?

Great question. I’d say Egypt/Cairo was worse than Marrakech. I went to Marrakech in 2017 and I really just remember only being hounded in a few stores but it was easy to walk away (as in the store merchant wouldn’t follow). The snake guys were the worst experience - I had one chase me for money in a square because I briefly panned my camera over their booth but he only got like 30 cents (USD) from me. I could be biased because I went to Cairo first so maybe I had practice being firm with vendors by that point, haha. 

Also, Marrakech was healthily crowded with tourists so I don’t think locals were desperate. I went to Cairo in 2012 during their Arab Spring but lucked out with the timing - it was right after they ousted Mubarak and before they had their first election. Nobody was traveling there and my travel partner and I basically had the historical sites to ourselves, which meant we were the only people they could hound. 

Also Cairo was way dirtier. They have a canal that runs through the city and I saw a dead, bloated Ox floating a few meters upstream from where naked children were bathing. 😓",2021-10-14 02:35:31
q7lwtx,"Reading through the comments in this thread I don’t think people are complaining about the McDonald’s… You may have been in Egypt during one of the most unique times in its long and storied history.

So please before you make false statements about Israel maybe check Israeli news in English if you don’t read Hebrew!!  And Btw Israel is a wonderful country and the majority of citizens are secular except for the ultra Religious Jewish and Arab citizens.  
Misogynistic behavior unfortunately happens in this country also, but Israel is a Middle East country with influence from neighboring countries and Jews that came from all over the world with varying cultures such as Iraq, Syria, Morocco and Yemen just to name a few.  
Now “honor killings” and the overwhelming majority of spousal murders of women happen in the Arab/Palestinian communities along with a very high rate of Arab-Israeli deadly violence in their villages.

15jmmp8,"I think that’s generally the larger perspective of the OP; McDonald’s does cater their menu in each country to the local preferences to gain favor. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. One of the best trips to McDonald’s I’ve ever encountered was in Zurich, Switzerland. And the place was absolutely packed. I ordered my standard order and it came out looking perfect like something out of an ad. Super tidy and picture perfect. Very Swiss. It also happened to be the single most expensive trip to McDonald’s I’ve ever taken. Two quarter pounder meals (or Royale Cheeseburger as they call it; shout out to my Pulp Fiction homies) with fries and drink were CHF34.00, about $38 or Ph P2128.00. Also very Swiss. That same set in the Philippines isn’t more than P600 or about $10.70 or CHF9.36. Exchange rates and worldwide supply chains are crazy. 

On the last point, don’t you know the unofficial slogan of the Philippines is, “Sorry out na po.”

Forgot to add I’m Filam, so for me, when in the Philippines where I live right now, I guess I just have a personal preference for McDo because it reminds me of home. When I’m home in the states, I miss my chickenjoy and jolly spaghetti. 🤷🏻‍♀️ idk can’t have it both ways I guess lol.

65rvmi,"I can recommend a well made movie that's gives a good sense of what this beautiful city is like.  Made in 2008, it's called ""In Bruges"" (a crime/drama but with light moments, starring Colin Farrell). We loved Bruges when we were there. The city is like being in a medieval fairytale. One piece of advice, don't try to walk downtown from the rail station with your rolling luggage.  With the cobblestone streets, you definitely look and sound like tourists trying to find your way!😜😉🇹🇩",2017-04-17 22:20:05

I'm the type of person that really likes to stay in a city for 3-4 days to really understand the culture and stuff. I don't like going to a place, take nice Instagram pictures and fuck off.

72x6zs,"Just an anecdote from June 1988, i was young, just finished high school in Croatia. Before going to university i went travelling across Yugoslavia, and spent a few days in Ljubljana also. Not being able to find a hotel room for the first night i decided to sleep in the park on a bench...with my belongings right next to me (even had a expensive looking camera). So while I enjoyed a lovely Summer night two elderly police officers (you know the type with big moustaches 😁) approached me while on patrol and tapped me on the shoulders trying not to scare me...and warned me that I should better sleep inside because (get this!) it was going to rain soon, but if I needed them for whatever reason I would find them on their post half a km away. Man, gotta love a country where the police is like that. And, yes I do love Slovenia, met my wife there as well. 😉",2017-09-28 17:58:10
72x6zs,"I feel that you're projecting your beliefs and from that stand categorizing drones as ""bad things"", you can't really enjoy a view like this standing on the shoreline can you? And in the same vein, if I can see everything on the internet and there's a million pictures already why even bother going? There's also the (thrill?) of taking cool pictures with it as well! I agree with you on not being a nuisance while you use it, but don't like how you represent drones/owners..
Or maybe i just misunderstood you, as english's not my first language. If that happened i apologize ☺️",2017-09-28 17:23:28

The mountains tower over a sea of clouds and they are covered with Japanese pine trees. 🎯  Very peaceful right?  Then your ears are shattered by the tour leaders.  Each one with a microphone and speaker.  Wacky. 🎋 Oh, and even on the pristine heights of HuangShan the Chinese spit ☔️.  I dunno.  Maybe it's a purification rite 🤐",2018-04-14 17:24:58

wo0ps1,"Ok, this is gonna annoy me now, lol! Hang on, I got a way of checking which doesn’t involve waking up my parents in Australia with a phone call from England.

Right, now, my mom got home to England around the time of the [1972 IRA bombing of the Aldershot Garrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Aldershot_bombing), which is the town my parents are from. That’s how I remembered the year. Also, in 1979 they were in Cornwall, waiting for my sister to be born. 

I’ll have to double check with them, though, maybe they got the years mixed up or something. Like I said, they’re King Charles’ age, but without the detailed daily records and servants. I’ll bring it up when I’m back at home in a few weeks (🤞).

ETA: I’m unfairly blaming my parents memories when it may very well be me remembering their story wrong. They lived it, after all, I only heard about it. Either way, it’s a story I’ll be asking them to retell when I get home.",2022-09-14 03:35:26

Sounds like a day trip from Tokyo is worth it from Hakone (have heard some great things!) - unfortunately AirBnB came up somewhat short (that’s what we’re using for Tokyo and Kyoto), and a hostel might be a tough sell as there’s a few bougie members of the group, lol 😅. ",2019-01-04 06:14:43

f0rf9a,"I love travel, but we are millennials with 9-5 (well, 7:30 to 5 😉) jobs, one of us has a pretty important job that cannot be done remotely, and we have kids and a lovely house and a large amount of land. I wouldn’t give any of that up to live in hostels or AirBnBs or a camper van and travel around for years. The reason why vacations are special is because they are rare. I’d rather go once in a while to someplace spectacular and be able to afford to do it luxe or at least comfortably than have to logistically plan housing, food, transpo for my entire family every month or whatever in a new country (and unless you’re a millionaire several times over, you’re doing it budget style).",2020-02-08 19:09:05

6ouj0h,"The ""rules"" were more like guidelines, as it turned out. We didn't want to trespass by any means, but ruffling a few feathers wasn't going to be an issue...
The support staff at Station 5 (where the bus lets off) was very helpful and friendly. Through some rough translation we figured out that it wasn't against the law to hike off-season, it was just ill-advised based on the snow conditions.

We were still a bit apprehensive until we spotted some hikers coming down from their night hike. They spoke English well, and gave us a few pointers before we set off...

Seeing the snowboarders riding down the mountain about an hour or so in was truly an amazing sight. I don't remember exactly what went through my head, but it was something along the lines of, ""Well... If they're alright, we're gonna be just fine"" 😂

I wore shorts (with long socks), a long sleeve thermal and a flannel shirt. I brought a windbreaker as well that came in handy when we stopped, but it was too warm to wear while hiking. That and a good pair of hiking boots is all you need... No ice axes or cramp-ons on our particular path, but I could see how they would come in handy if the conditions were different. If you have them and don't mind the extra weight, I'd definitely bring them.

[Pic from about halfway (2/3?) way up...](https://i.imgur.com/DEgaUKg.jpg) ",2017-07-22 23:46:56
6ouj0h,"I'm confused. Do you honestly think anyone--myself included--is going to show up to Fuji in a wind/snowstorm wearing shorts and a flannel shirt and say, ""Fuck it... I can handle this!"" 😳
Do you really think people are that stupid? Are YOU that stupid, that you'd need someone to tell you to put a jacket on when it's raining? I really don't get your point, and I feel like repeating mine again would land on deaf ears...
I've only told people when they ask, and I've been upfront with the point that it's not really the safest idea. It's totally possible, and an absolutely incredible experience for anyone who chooses to take that risk while they're there. Taking calculated risks is part of life, and a major part of enjoying travel.
It wasn't blind luck that I survived last night when I crossed a busy street; I looked both ways! Same scenario when I chose to hike Fuji on a sunny 60ish degree day in May a few years back. I was as prepared as I needed to be, and I am quite experienced with the outdoors and observing weather conditions. I don't find it necessary or helpful to add that ""If it's a fucking blizzard, don't hike it"", when I tell travel stories. You might burn your mouth on some udon if you're not careful too; there are some things that just don't need to be said.
Fuji is ugly in the summer without the snow. It's overcrowded, and generally not a great place to be for a nature lover. I'd recommend hiking it in May 1,000 more times if you'd like to continue the conversation.",2017-07-23 00:53:20
6ouj0h,"Get fucked. You aren't making a point, you're just whining like an old lady about how dangerous you think something is, and assuming that anyone (specifically, someone without $1,500 worth of climbing gear on hand) doing it must be insane, or at very least idiotically careless.

[This guy hiking Everest in his shorts should be thrown in the fucking looney bin then!](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2655008/Dutch-father-five-dubbed-Iceman-turn-thermostat-using-mind-sets-world-record-climbing-Everest-just-shorts.html) 

I flew to fucking Japan with this hike in mind; we knew pretty much everything we were getting ourselves into, and never once considered ourselves careless or stupid. Neither did the other hikers we saw at he beginning, or the truly madmen who hiked up and snowboarded down while we were on our way up. Amazingly, dodging death with every turn...

[(Here's a picture of these maniacs at the bus stop later that day; I never got a good on of them riding)](https://i.imgur.com/hJsrJv1.jpg) 

Don't assume, because you're a pussy, that a dangerous risk can't be a calculated one. If it makes you feel better about living in your little bubble to call me lucky, then go right ahead. I must be the luckiest guy in the world then, since all these stupid/dangerous/fun things I keep doing never seem to kill me 😂 Maybe, just maybe... They're CALCULATED risks. You should turn off the computer and try one sometime...

I didn't make a post about me and my trip, looking for attention and trying to look cool. I answered a few people who asked about Fuji and crowds, weather, gear needed, etc.  As anecdotal as it may have been, it was sound advice, coupled even with a mild disclaimer. You're the only one that seems to be getting butt hurt here, pining for attention with your Ricky Rescue/Safely bullshit. It must be exhausting to be so boring.

Edit/P.S. - I hiked Half Dome in a pair of Vans and a backpack full of Coors Lite (classy, I know). It doesn't take an REI membership to make the world your own. Weather be damned, if you wanna go do something, quit bitching and do it. Hike Fuji in fucking January if you really have some nuts, or do it in August like every other idiot. Just have fun.",2017-07-23 01:40:03
6ouj0h,"For lack of formatting know-how, we'll go in numbered order...

Does he have special powers that make his risks calculated, and mine not?

3. ) They were SNOWBOARDING down broken ice sheets in late spring in Fuji--the exact ice you've been fucking whining about being so dangerous this whole time--and THEY have their shit together?!
Jeezass fucking Christ, you are ridiculous. REI salesmen love idiots like you, who think a bright blue gortex marmot jacket makes you a real adventurer!

4. ) Yep 👍🏼 

5. ) I'm quite obviously very qualified, considering that I've been there and experienced the exact topic of conversation. Never once did I ever say, ""fuck it; just go climb in your tennis shoes, you'll be fine"". I don't own crampons, nor do I give a shit how to spell them. It takes a real idiot to equate spelling and knowhow in a convo like this... Digging deep are ya?

6. ) Yes, it was. Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it wasn't sound.

In what world do you live in, that telling someone, ""Hey, this is dangerous but it's a ton of fun!"" is a bad thing?! Maybe we should rid the internet of all the fun pictures of anyone doing anything dangerous...
We can sit at home and pet our cats, thinking of all the safety nets we've suffocated ourselves with in the name of being careful.

Rules on drones are quite clear in almost ALL countries around the world. If you Bring specialised gear you should look for the rules. That’s YOUR responsibility, not the country you’re visiting.

Great pictures though!",2018-04-08 06:22:17

You don’t care about the countries rules, the enviroment, it’s people and animals. You care about taking a great picture that you can share, and If your equipment gets taken you think to yourself “Ah I can buy a new one”.

I didn’t meet anyone who wasn’t fluent in English except one cashier at a grocery store. But she was very friendly and knew enough if I needed help.

I guess a lot of that can be attributed to the amount of tourists they have to deal with though.",2020-04-18 11:29:41

Didn’t have issues. One of the best trips of my life albeit it being cold in December. I’d do it again ❤️,2024-03-20 21:08:08

1bjl9ku,"I really hope OP sees this comment because I've been trying to recreate photos like these for a long time but keep failing.

It's this style that I really admire and want to learn but I have no idea where to start with. Is it the photo editing technique? The camera? The angles? Please let me know if you have any references or tips.

EDIT: To be exact it is the 3rd, 5th and 6th photos that really catch my interest. All the others are superb but it's just these 3 in particular that I'd like to start with😅",2024-03-21 13:04:03

1bjl9ku,"Haha no but these comments are making me think I should be 😂 

I couldn’t choose a favourite place because I genuinely loved them all for different reasons. Maybe I’d put Jaipur and Varanasi at the top if I had to! 

Favourite dish was chole bhature and jalebi or gulab jamun! There was one other savoury street food dish I loved, will try find out the name",2024-03-21 07:08:23

I don’t know if I could ever be bored of seeing the Taj Mahal… Ranthambore I wouldn’t go again just because I couldn’t take the disappointment if we didn’t see tigers a second time 😂 Varanasi was an incredible experience but I don’t know if I need to go more than once if that makes sense?",2024-03-21 13:23:55

Very romantic city, wether summer, winter, authumn or spring, though I think the later two are the best time to visit weather wise.

We drove from Edinburgh  to Glencoe and back in one day but if I  could do it again (and I totally will 😁 one day ) I would've like to do Edinburgh > Glencoe > isle of Skye > stay in some bnb  > Inverness /North coast> one more bnb stop> back to Edinburgh. But we still had a great time even though it was only one day in the highlands. You'll have a great time. I doubt there's anywhere you could go up there where it isn't absolutely gorgeous.

I think possibly it might be a cultural difference, whether your friend was steadfast in his own culture and/or unintentionally ignorant in the way things are over here.

The only way we Canadians might possibly not be as ""connected"" is that generally we as a nation aren't as family orientated as other countries. Smaller families, spread apart, and we teach independence at a young age. I've never been to the middle east but I have reason to think that they are similar in the way they perceive family values like in Latin/South and SE Asian countries do. My wife immigrated here and that was what she noticed the most, but her and her countrymen all agree that Canadians are very welcoming and warm. Different experiences 🤷",2022-04-28 21:02:55

you live in a literal treasure trove paradise of medieval architecture and still chose egypt. baffled i tell you, baffled.

bro i wish i lived a couple hrs of train ride away from some of the most beautiful places in Europe. you ppl are really spoilt for choice. i have to go on a plane or drive for 15 hrs to get to a place worth visiting.

maybe we have different tastes but in no way could i ever understand someone choosing a horrible place like egypt over one of the most beautiful countries in the world (UK).

if i had the privilege of being a uk citizen i would celebrate every day from the sheer happiness it would give me. it would literally be a reason to live and get out of bed.

Also, imagine contacting the US embassy because you can't figure out how to get cash because you didn't bring your bank card with you 🤣 I would love to see their response. I'm going to guess they have a few more important things to attend to.",2022-04-28 22:17:30

Everything is a choice, and choosing to travel solo safely as a young woman means giving up money, time, planning, communicating, and lots of energy - and there’s always an inherent risk. I choose to travel solo most of the time because I don’t want to waste my life waiting around for others to join me for adventures, but do not for a second think I’m not constantly on edge when alone. I’m also not surprised that’s the impression you’ve gotten of solo female travelers, because showing any form of vulnerability makes us an easy target.

I work as a filmmaker in my home country of Israel, and usually do commercial work.
After a long time of dealing with clients, scripts, shot lists and editing deadlines I decided I wanted to try something new and find a new balance for my career and personal life, which are intertwined because I’m a workaholic.
After my military service I came back to doing the same commercial work that was exciting but I still wanted something different.
This is when I decided to venture out with no plan to a country that seemed cool with not much research, and just make a film about anything.
I ended up meeting an old Buddhist monk and interviewing him as the main part of the film.
Now I’m back home, working on a balance between my art and my work, and of course working on the next film :)
The film I made in Vietnam will come out online on July 12th.

ekb1rz,"You could easily spend the whole 7 days and probably more on the South Island, I’ve done 1 x 10 day trip and 1x7 day trip and still feel like there is lots I haven’t seen. Depends how much driving you’d like to do, campervan/RV’s are a good way to go. Arguably the biggest highlights of the South Island are queenstown and probably a Milford sound cruise, we really enjoyed wanaka and hiking up roys peak, there are some hot springs in tekapo also, and there are lots of adventure activities you can do in and around queenstown. My gf made a video you might like of a trip we did there not too long ago might help you decide what you’d like to see. Have a great trip! 👌🏻[South Island Travel guide](https://youtu.be/H1-Z4rPCiFk)",2020-01-07 23:10:01

x90kc4,">I love and hate NYC at the same time. Growing up, I never thought I'd leave. Reality hit and I couldn't afford it. Moved a cpl states over where I was making the same, but could afford the rent. I always think I can enjoy my visits, but then I arrive and I'm quickly pissed off with all the traffic and drama that I am no longer accustomed to. And I don't just mean Manhattan. It's anarchy in any borough I'm going to. Basically, I can't visit NY or Jersey w/o wanting to rip heads off. I start screaming in the car, ""Can we all just space out, there's a whole world out there!!! Why do you all live here?!"" 😂  
>  
>I love having been raised there tho. I have an appreciation for diversity that I believe many places lack. Not saying we're perfect, but we def flow together cause at the end of the day, we're just New Yorkers hittin that corner Bodega.",2022-09-08 19:13:44
x90kc4,"That’s the big kicker: cost. I grew up in SF and I love city living too, but I just couldn’t justify paying way too much for a broom closet in a shitty neighborhood because it’s the cheapest place in Manhattan. There are so many other cities in the US that are just as cool or even cooler than NYC that cost way less (and have also actually figured out what to do with their trash other than just pile it up on the street). Now I live in an arguably cooler city paying less to live in one of the best neighborhoods (and a normal amount of trash 😆)",2022-09-08 16:40:34
x90kc4,I mean like not all of you....we have some room lol but don't need the whole population of NYC here 😂,2022-09-08 16:00:39
x90kc4,"Nah I’m good, but thanks. Already found another east coast city that’s way cooler and cheaper than NYC (but I’m not name dropping it… I don’t want everybody finding out how cool it is and coming here to ruin it 😆)",2022-09-08 16:38:31
x90kc4,Maybe a little too cold… and I don’t think Boston is too much cheaper than NYC 😆 not where I’m at now though,2022-09-08 17:19:50
x90kc4,"Pretty sure you’re the one who made two consecutive passive aggressive insults, and then you doubled down on direct ad-hominem about a person on Reddit you don’t know to try to defend your insults, all because you took a comment about how expensive a city is as a personal attack.

s5czcx,"Thanks for the info! Yeah, I've seen on some of the weed subs people have said not to expect the same high you get from 'normal' cannabis like buds or wax or edibles etc cause it just isn't the same. I'm very interested to try it out and see what is so different about it and experience it! As far as these subcultures go...is that something that would still be attainable for a white tourist? Not sure if locals would see a white American (also woman if that makes a difference in it too) and make them feel skeeved out or something. I know I have people tell me all the time they never suspected me of smoking weed because I'm very quiet and always get pinned as innocent or something lmao. Little do they know too that I go to raves 🤣 

Honestly I wish cannabis could be as widespread and normal as alcohol ended up being. I always dream of how nice it would be to go to almost any place in the world and instead of being able to drink beer or whatever is popular there, wine, liquors etc and being able to buy some flower or whatever is regional to there. It adds another layer of enhancement and enjoyment to things for me personally. I don't know what it is but getting high and then exploring nature or a city is the most fun. Especially when trying new foods!",2022-01-16 21:40:13

1ay65e1,"So, this has been a bittersweet thread to read! On the plus side: I’m happy to say I’ve been lucky enough to try a majority of the foods mentioned regularly (maybe not exact brands, but those items in those countries at least). On the sad side, it reminded me of loads of foods I haven’t eaten recently 🥲

I’m lucky that my partner is just as big of a traveller/foodie as I am, and supports my constant quest to track down restaurants/ingredients and keep a stocked pantry. So just the last three days alone, I’ve cooked Jamaican, Moroccan and Polish food for dinner. We pick up spices/seasonings when we travel, and then I track down other ingredients from speciality stores here in the U.K. if necessary.

But probably the cuisine that I pine over most often is Chinese, specifically Sichuan (though I enjoy other regions too). After living there a few years I got a real taste for it, but it’s taken a lot of practice to get consistent results as a home cook with a different (European) background. About once a fortnight when the cravings get too much I’ll make a whole multi-dish Chinese meal, but not more often as it’s a bit of process!

Like a lot of people here, I miss the quality/convenience of Japan, and the flavours/freshness of Vietnam. Or just street food in Asia in general, to be honest! If you know where to look, you can buy/make most things here in the U.K., but it’s a lot more effort/expense than in their country of origin.

• Lamb kebabs, Xinjiang/Western China

I also like Greece a lot, especially if you're looking for nice beaches and ancient historical sights.

Cook some bratwurst on one of their public BBQs by lake Zurich. Eat some sprüngli for dessert. Leave the city and walk one of thousands of immaculate walking trails where campfire spots are stocked with wood by the local Gov for free public use, visit a little hillside church, observe local cows mooing gracefully, snack on some Migro brand chocolate (it’s the cheap but best one).

y1h4au,Yep.  Right there with you.  I’ve been to Europe 4 times in the last 10 years. Twice to England and twice to Amsterdam and Brussels.  The atmosphere and culture are wonderful.

y1h4au,"I remember feeling super depressed for exactly this reason after my first trip to Europe at age 25. 

I think the short answer is to return as often as you can😉 that’s what motivates me, at any rate. Longer term, I would love to travel a lot when I retire - split my time 50/50 between the US and Euro once I’m done working. Real estate in certain areas can be much less expensive than the US, so that’s another option (although my perspective is skewed, as I live in a high COL city in the US).",2022-10-12 00:47:42
y1h4au,"Yeah, I feel for you. I’ve spent most of my adult life wishing I lived just about ANYWHERE in Europe. If you’re young and single, why don’t you figure out a way to move there?  If I knew of a city in the US that was similar to a European city, I would recommend it. I just don’t. I live on the West Coast, and I’ve discovered that the closest city near me that gives off a European vibe is probably Victoria, BC (in Canada). It reminds me of Scotland.  You might try some Canadian cities. Or just get a job in Europe. Or just determine that people are pretty much the same everywhere, so you have to just decide to be happy where you are. 🤷🏻‍♀️",2022-10-12 00:48:13
y1h4au,"American here that has lived in Prague for 4 years 👋
🇺🇲🛫🛬🇨🇿

I can say with full confidence that the grass is greener over here. There are pros and cons, of course, but overall I feel way more comfortable here.

- I haven't owned (or needed a car) in 4 years
- I can walk to about 20 restaurants for lunch - almost none of which are big corporate chains with preservative packed ingredients
- I feel comfortable walking around the city at night alone
- if I lose my job I don't have to scramble for health insurance
- I'm guaranteed 5 weeks vacation


I miss my family and America so much, but the fact is America hasn't been developed with THE AVERAGE PERSON in mind since probably the 1950s. Each year I become increasingly more glued to Europe and the prospects in America become less appearing (even as somebody who is from there).

America is being developed for cars, corporations, and the ultra wealthy. I don't think anyone can really deny that at this point. Europe is not perfect, but you can live a life of dignity here without participating too heavily in the rat race.",2022-10-12 08:53:40

y1h4au,"I feel the opposite way. The cultural allure of Americana is strong, and is tempting precisely because it’s different to all the old historic buildings where I live. So just remember, the grass on the other side always seems greener. Having said that, why not apply for a job in a European capital with a big company - maybe they’ll relocate you.

y1h4au,"I just come back from my first ever vacation to the states and I have to say America is different compared to Austria for sure.   

If I was rich I would enjoy living in America more than living in Austria to be honest. The US is big and diverse and you can do many execiting things.   Life in my 100.000 people Austrian hometown is really bland and boring compared to that.

But is safe compared to America.   Personal safety is much more important than bordom.

As normal citzen living in America could be hard due to safety issues but  in case I could afford living in sophiscated area that offers a higher level of security I  might chose living  in the states instead of Austria. But that's just highly theoretical.

It’s not an issue there), school shootings (they don’t have them there) and other issues. Anyway - I do feel like the mental Heath crisis has a lot to do with how we live in America. And the focus on “things” and the more more more mentality.

Wow- I really went off on a tangent. All that to say is that I do think the grass is always greener, both my parents were born in Greece and think the US is the best place on earth, but I think you have the right perspective. We have so much natural beauty here - and enjoy it. Just appreciate what we do have. And try to bring back some of the Europe’s with you. I get together for walks with friends - it’s not the same as strolling through a quaint street - but it’s something. 😊.",2022-10-12 09:57:12

After living in the US for a a while I agree on all the mass consumerism in cities (chain stores, restaurants, malls, ads everywhere). But once outside the big cities...my god what amazing and huge national parks, preserves, landmarks, etc...

I would love to take months off work and just like those early 2000 comedy movies with family in RV's, travel the US for a while 😍 take it slow...explore state by state",2022-10-12 10:01:38
y1h4au,"Wow this post hits close to my heart. I feel ya OP. 

My mom is a travel agent and my family celebrated travel since I was young so I’m grateful to say I’m well-traveled. My partner and I visited the Netherlands in May. They had studied abroad there but it was my first time exploring Holland. I had been to Europe many times before however (mom and I love Italy so we have been there the most) so I was not surprised when I slipped into rhythm of Europe lifestyle. 

What I relished was the ease of public transit and how everywhere I looked, I could see people pleased with life. The Netherlands is about 16,000 square miles IIRC. I believe the government can care for its people due to the size of the country and the population. So I looked up if there was a US state that was approximately that size.

The answer is NO THERE IS NOT. There are small states under 10,000 square miles and then the next smallest state is about 24,000 square miles. 

I live in Saint Louis and last week visited Toronto. Not only were the Canadians better drivers (we drove to Toronto), but Toronto had us feeling like we were in Chicago on one block and Amsterdam on another block. It felt like an elegant mix of North American with a strong European influence. Definitely helped that we saw plenty of French not only on signs but spoken casually. Hearing many foreign tongues in a single day is not what I experience regularly in Saint Louis. 

After visiting The Netherlands (we stayed in Den Hague but it was lovely to use trains to get anywhere we wanted with ease), my partner and I are firmly in the camp that it’s time to move away from Saint Louis (we are in the music world and the culture in Saint Louis unfortunately doesn’t support or celebrate the music history/roots in this town), to pursue growth but are trying to figure out where to move to exactly (hence the trip to Toronto). While we didn’t travel as much as OP, we are in a similar mindset that something is seriously wrong culturally (which influences design, governmental decisions, etc) with the US. Many agree and it’s too much to “fix” but simultaneously I feel guilty bc if I leave, that won’t change what’s wrong with it. It feels like giving up or abandoning the potential of a better culture for generations in the future. 

I’ve also tried to reason and find a reasonable compromise… find a US town that would be suitable for us. Saint Louis already has low cost of living so finding something similar in cost could potentially be a downgrade in other areas. 

Here’s to hoping we (and OP) can find our ideal environment for the lifestyles we want, the growth we have the potential for, the happiness we deserve, and the regular adventure we yearn for. 

PS: many in the US don’t have the opportunity or the desire to go abroad to see how backwards US culture and city design are and I find that to be a core reason why the culture is so behind the times. Maybe if more young people had that opportunity, there would be a chance for change. 🙏🏼 🗺",2022-10-12 16:59:10

y1h4au,"I live in Central Europe and was on vacation in the US just a few weeks ago. Once back, I thought: Nice people, nice landscapes, but I would never like to live there. The reasons are exactly what you wrote down. Wide but dead cities that are built for cars. Never ending parking lots with fast food restaurants and exchangeable stores, nothing in walking range as if space consumption and sustainable City planning is no topic at all. Sick 10 lane motorways going parallel to other 4 lane streets but no public transit. Lots of poverty, homeless people everywhere, many of them elderly, mentally ill or heavy drug abusers. When walking into dog shit in Downtown San Francisco or Los Angeles, you dont know if its from a dog or a poor soul. No Social Security at all. I saw a probably 90 years old Lady working as a cashier at Walmart, she was older than my grandma who is retired for 20 years. I found that harsh contrast of flying to the moon but letting people desolate on the street or as working poor frustrating given that I am visiting one of the richest countries in the World.

You’d need to find a small suburban type town where people are chill, but then you might not have “the history” and the transportation and etc. until then you have the stressed city people hustling and cursing.

Everything just makes sense. Things are logical. 

 No one stares at you. No one bothers you. It is safer than streets of London.

No pick pockets, no harassing beggars, no scam artists like in Europe. 

Air quality is amazing, scenery is breathtaking. 

No overcrowding in my 2000 sq ft house that I bought for $150,000, 6 years ago. Unlike Canada, our mortgage rates can be fixed. 😃

I get to keep most of salary with such low taxes. Making six figures Working as a technician with only 2 years of community college which is cheaper than Canada.

My well raised kids can get all sorts of grants, scholarships, work-study and subsidized loans to get a 4 year degree.  Unlike student loans in India which require a collateral and have 15 -20% interest + many fees.

Driving in the US is better than anywhere else - speed limits are enjoyable, no tickets by camera no 15kmh speed limits like Canada. 

No clusterfuck/battlefield roads like India. Cheap gas and amazing cars. Awesome portion sizes at restaurants. 

No life threatening rules against partying like UAE. 
And I can buy alcohol after 10pm unlike Canada. 

I enjoy my freedom and peace!

Around 94 longhouses (large village centers) were burnt down between when the first settlers arrived in 1850 to when the last village was burnt down in 1907.  All the Coast Salish/Duwamish who lived there were put into camps (canvas tents) along a river.  Then shortly afterwards they were pushed off that land and put on an island created by the settlers that was literally a pile of garbage including boulders that were used as ballast for ships.  Then when WW2 started the settlers even wanted that space so the Coast Salish/Duwamish were kicked off and had no land. Those who survived scattered all over Seattle & the surrounding area.

We took the bus up the mountain to walk down the stairs.

whlda8,"Thai is my husband's dream 😅. He literally just wants to start walking and see where we end up. I feel like I have so many questions lol. 

What made you want to do this?

When you get to turkey are you just turning around and walking home?

I assume you are not working ""from home"". How long 
did it take you to plan this or did you just decide one day to say screw it and start walking? Are you currently employed somewhere and have a house/apartment to go back to and on sabbatical? You don't need to answer this question as it's pretty personal but these are some of the main things holding us back. How much do you budget you need to survive each week (food, hostels, extra shoes, etc) 

How much food do you carry with you? How often do you have to go into town to get supplies? (or maybe you're walking very busy/public paths) 

Any scary stories? My biggest fear is setting up camp somewhere and running into something wild or someone who wants to kill me (I've probably watched/read too many true crime shows/books)

How are your feet holding up? Did you do any sort of long distance walk ""training"" prior to this? My husband and I are fairly active but no way am I walking this much everyday and not having sore feet.

Do you get lonely?

Beautiful photos! 😊",2022-08-06 21:32:58

Just not at JBR beach (the one in the picture), it's not a nice beach. There's construction wherever you look, it's a pain to get to JBR, the traffic is a nightmare and it's even more stressful to get out of there.

By what I've learned so far, it would probably be 1 day Astana the rest - south and then back for the plane. Maybe one way via train and then back by plane. If it was a normal year, I would have probably already purchased the tickets, but at the moment it seems like everything is too uncertain.

I've struggled (and continue to) with the ""validity"" of my depression because I have never felt those things. 

Again, not trying to attack you or call you it, I just think if *I've* felt this way before, surely there must be others who have or do as well, and maybe it will help them to read this. Everyone's depression is different. 💙",2020-05-28 16:30:31

2) How expensive are food, ho(s)tels, recreation and transport (or gas) there?

In terms of prices it's comparable to Iceland, I.e. everything is expensive (food, transport, accommodation etc.).

Not sure about your expectations since you think Iceland was overrated. Faroe Islands doesn't have the volcanoes, glaciers, geysers and more which you can find in Iceland but it's far less busy with tourists and much greener and has many more mountains and fjords. It's great for hikes and the population is super friendly.

emckuo,"(in hopes I can maybe help someone or give some ideas) 
Honestly there are many more beautiful places to explore in Croatia than what most tourist sites say, cause I feel it's mostly the same stuff and is based about Dalmacija which, yes, is the most tourist based part of our country and has a lot of attractions organized for the tourists. I guess people don't realize there is much more to see with the same amount of history and equally as beautiful but maybe cheaper and less crowded. 
My suggestion, yes, if it's your first time in Croatia definitely check out Hvar, Dubrovnik, Split, Zadar, Šibenik, Korčula, NP Krka, Plitvička jezera, and so on, cause you will love it, they are one of my favorite places and I travel to Split and Šibenik a lot. 
But if you feel more adventurous or you have already been to Croatia and would like to come back go for places you don't find that much. For example Istra is beautiful (Pula, Poreč, national park Brijuni, Hum that is said to be the smallest city in the world), Gorski kotar (national park Risnjak or Platak, but just if you just take a drive on the old rode through Gorski kotar and not the highway, it's so beautiful, and has so much preserved of the old villages and the thing is people still live there), Učka, Paklenica, Velebit, Kopački rit, so many national parks and nature parks, a lot od places and buildings under UNESCO. 
Just search a little bit harder, check out the map of Croatia find some cities you like, Google them and see what they have to offer instead of going for the obvious 😄
I'm from Rijeka and Rijeka is definitely not a tourist city, it's industrial city, but I love it here, I love the view from a lot of different places in the city, I love the history (and Rijeka is European capital of culture for 2020 and has the 3rd biggest Carnevale in the world), you have Opatija near Rijeka that is such a beautiful city that is tourist based but I hardly ever see people mention it, you have Bakar, you have Kostrena, Crikvenica, Senj, Krk, Cres, Mali Lošinj, Veliki Lošinj, Rab, Karlovac... Just take your pick, you definitely won't be disappointed 😊
Sorry about the long post, I just see a lot of people talk about visiting Croatia and it's always the same few cities so I thought it would be a good idea to maybe mention some other places to visit from the perspective of someone who lives here.

fevwcv,"Of course, I don't mind at all. This has me reliving some very enjoyable riding days. 😇

It's a balance, but you really do decide in the moment. Generally speaking, in the situation you've described, you would be polite and wait for others, taking up just enough space that it feels very much like you're putting your foot in the door — not impeding flow, but poking your head in for the right opportunity. No different in vibe from taking a left turn at a light in North America, really, except that the light never changes.

Sometimes, if traffic is slow enough, you might eventually just push your way through, and that's okay — just don't be an asshole about it, your goal is not to inconvenience others too much, and again, move in a way that you allow others to go around you. 

But what will usually happen in the kind of situation you've described — in dense traffic, particularly — is that as you're waiting to take your left, someone else will pull up alongside you, also waiting to take a left. Then another, then another, bunching up to the point where it's like a dam ready to burst and then.. it just does. Someone goes first, and the opposite crowd stops, and a path is cleared through, and suddenly you and the other twenty people who were with you flow like water through the intersection to the other side.

I hope that makes sense? 

You'll get the hang of it, I promise. It's a remarkably cool feeling, nothing can *quite* describe it, and I wish everyone had a chance to experience it. 

You said you're going in December, right? What's your itinerary? Are you hitting up other places?",2022-09-30 05:05:44

9u3r9o,"I don’t think you are doing something wrong. Light conditions are just great in the photo golden hour and nice clouds. Not too dark not too bright. Perfect conditions. You don’t need a 1000 $ camera to take such a photo.

anche3,"I totally agree with this!!

I live in Japan and have gone twice to the museum. 🤓 It has a special feature room that changes, so I always recommend that people who have already been (and loved it) return whenever they get the chance :) 

Last one I saw was a cafe filled with fake food displays of Ghibli food found in movies and it was EPIC 😭 ",2019-02-06 01:26:54
anche3,"Yeah I totally agree. I can barley get tickets for my self and my visiting friends and I live here, so it must be even more frustrating to be a visitor with a limited amount of time in Japan.

But... part of me loves how extra special it makes the actual visit feel once you get tickets. Almost akin to finally getting tickets to see a favourite band play live. 

I never expected to go again so I really tried to absorb the experience fully, and they have a no photography rule (with exception to the garden rooftop & Cafe) so the exhibits are extra exciting.

Hope you get those golden tickets one day, hope our channel helped your trip out a wee bit. 🇯🇵 ",2019-02-06 06:14:16

Whaaaaaa

Sometimes I wish I could go back and listen to things for the first time, or see an adored movie for the first time again — I envy you in that way! Haha 

definitely check them out— each album has a different vibe 

My personal recommendation is to listen to the album Currents first, or just some compiled top tracks like [this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO3n0Aus?si=pYilqncgSKKsep9UWEoDbg)

Also— if you have a moment; their live shows are INSANE. See anything from 2020 on and you’ll be blown away even if you don’t love the music, the spectacle is larger than any Vegas/broadway show imo — easy search on YT",2022-10-15 21:32:35

Or he could just go ahead and fly from Italy. Really, all his options are bad, the only question being which is the *least* bad. 🤔",2023-09-15 07:02:18

eqeu93,"For some reason the Trappist monestaries are expanding. Which is quite annoying🤔 - you get ""more"" beers from it, but it doesn't give you a ""history of brewing"".

When in first stumbled into Belgium I tried them all, and at that time it was only the Belgium plus La Trappe in Netherlands. And this was 15 or so years ago.

So historically it was a way for the monks to fund their monastary - and a good example here is Westvleteren which was awarded best beer in the world. After this demand for the beer skyrocketed and they had to impose restrictionist on how many cases each car could buy - I think it was one case pr number plate. They didn't increase production or price, but the resale price went drastically up.

Anyway - I'm rambling. There are as you said a lot of monasteries that brews beer, they are just not part of the Trappist ""movement"". I think it's just a branch of Christian monasteries and you apply to be a part of it. And bing bong you make Trappist beers? 

That's where I'm lost. It used to be that Trappist beers where ""propper Munks"" making ""propper beer"" with age old traditions. But if anyone can become one there's nothing special about it anymore. It's just a brewery (which makes good beers).",2020-01-19 09:01:20

10fxx86,Lovely pictures! I was really bummed at just how touristy Venice was in late 2019 😕 it seemed everything just just tourist trap gift shops.

One of the things I found funny was the local police with speed radars trying to catch overspeeding boats 😁

Thankfully, it was all in French, and my dad was completely oblivious the guy was talking about him. My French boyfriend, however, had a few choice words for the guy that seemed to put him in his place. Later that evening we walked by the same guy in the street being loudly yelled at by his wife because she can’t go out in public with him anymore because all he does is cause embarrassment. 😆

16ubd2t,"Yup!  I've worn a mask while flying for prob last 10 years, i live in Asia so its not so unusual but i do feel the looks when flying even before the pandemic, i also wipe down the tray tables with a wipe 🤷 I don't care if people look at me anymore, I used to get sick after every flight...no autoimmune issue as far as I know I just got bronchitis a lot & always issues after flying but zero after I started wearing masks on flights, so to enjoy my trip and get the most out of visiting friends & family & travels i will also wear a mask while traveling.  The looks I was getting at Heathrow, London wearing a mask in 2022...when my country was still almost closed to travel and required pre-departure & arrival tests was unbelievable!

16ubd2t,"A woman on my flight to AMS was berated by a psycho lady for wearing a mask. She told her she was going to get brain damage from lack of oxygen 😂 The mask wearing lady told us she had an autoimmune disease. Regardless of your health status, if you want to wear a mask you should do so unbothered by others. Doesn’t hurt anyone. Crazy lady went on to wear a scarf wrapped around her head the whole flight to “keep her ears warm.”",2023-09-28 15:45:21

16ubd2t,I wear a mask on the plane so as not to catch germs especially at the start of a vacation… and also to catch drool if I unfortunately slept. You won’t snap a picture of me in that compromising position (especially people are weird taking photos of strangers). 💅🏻,2023-09-28 18:35:21
16ubd2t,I’ve been wearing a mask on planes so that when I fall asleep with my mouth open I don’t look like an idiot 😂,2023-09-29 03:12:33
16ubd2t,"Honestly, I'm considering wearing one again on flights. My husband and I got home from our honeymoon earlier this month, and we both got sick because there were people coughing all around us. Most of the coughing people were masked, but a woman sitting right behind us wasn't. So, 8.5-9 hours of delicious germ exposure 🤮

The sickness triggered what felt like an asthma attack about 9 days after we got home. But, I just went in for pulmonary tests, and apparently, it's not asthma (that's a whole other story). But, essentially, I've felt like shit for a month, and wearing a mask could have prevented this crap. 

People will stare, but who cares. You're taking care of yourself, and that's what's important.",2023-09-29 16:37:59
16ubd2t,I wear a mask too in planes because of lowered immune system so i understand you but to be fair i just don’t have it in me to care. Before the plane takes off i’m asleep no matter how long the flight 😬,2023-09-29 22:06:38

Just don’t be creepy to me or try to pester me when I’ve expressed I’m not interested and we’re good 💕

I will say though, my experiences with me masking on a plane or crowded spaces have been positive when people have asked - when I explain why they’re actually pretty nice about it, but maybe I’ve just been exceptionally lucky 😅",2023-09-28 15:10:57
16ubd2t,"Funny story, I have a smokers cough. During and since Covid sometimes if I cough too much I will get stares. Like I’m coughing Covid all over TJMaxx or something. If I catch someone staring I always say “It’s not Covid, it’s Marlboro”. 😂  They usually laugh or blush. 

You’d have a better time getting comfortable being stared at than trying to change anyone’s mind or reaction. Who cares what they think or say. It just shows their ignorance and lack of ability to critically think so save your energy!!",2023-09-28 14:05:56

16ubd2t,"Actually, you're much more likely to get sick wearing a mask because people who do, tend to constantly touch it, transferring germs from everything they come in contact with to their face, bringing them closer to their orifices. 😉",2023-09-28 20:55:59
16ubd2t,1st time I took my mask off in the office since this shit started I got covid. I'm immunocompromised and it kicked my ass. I'm not only wearing it for flights I keep mine on until I get home. ❤️,2023-09-28 17:37:45

16ubd2t,I like wearing masks while traveling because they hide the fact I sleep with my mouth open. 🥲,2023-09-29 00:46:55
16ubd2t,Mask should be a part of the dresscode! ☺️ But on a serious note you should wear whatever you want and whatever makes you happy and comfortable. Even if you did not have an autoimmune disease. (Sorry to hear that by the way) Who are we to judge! But do people stare that much in general? Usually they are in zombie mode watching on their can’t leave my smartphone alone. Smartphones are controlling us! At least that is my experience in public transport or at airports.,2023-09-29 01:02:25

I juuuust started immunosuppresants for my autoimmune condition, and as such will be masking for a super long flight coming up in a  two weeks. Hate that I am worried that people will give me shit for it 🙄

Hong Kong is one of the best cities in the world. You can hike, go to the beach, and party downtown all in the same day. And you could probably do different locations for months at least. 

Get a octopus card at the MTR and it'll save you a bunch of hassle. Buses are easy as well and works with the octopus card! Brilliant! If you can't speak Cantonese the best thing to do in a taxi is just look up the place if you can. If not, look it up before hand. Wifi is frequent around Circle Ks and 7/11.

If you are gonna party in LKF, some fun clubs are Pulse, Fly, Levels, etc. the list is long. The best place for cheap alcohol though is 7/11. $1 USD for a beer. 👏

Best of luck. Have fun.

It’s not like we want to have to scream at them to get their attention but I agree that no one should stand for being treated that way.  You did the right thing.,2021-10-12 04:02:00
q5n9r5,"And that is why I fucking hate Texas. Lived there for a while. It was a shitpile, especially to drive. People just did what they wanted. Trash everywhere. Shooting happening all day everyday 🤷‍♂️",2021-10-12 01:34:17
q5n9r5,Hmm I’ll have to ask him what specialty seating it was he upgraded for via southwest then 🤔,2021-10-11 12:01:35
q5n9r5,">	Well 8pm rolls around and I’ve heard nothing. I tag them in a tweet bashing them, not even 20 minutes later I get a call 

This is the real pro-tip. Do not call customer service. Do not open up a card dispute. Open your Twitter and fucking 👏🏻 **DRAG** 👏🏻 **THEM** 👏🏻  names and receipts. You will 100% get reached out to within 24 hours, and they will bend over backwards to make it right. They don’t give a shit if some overworked call center drone is bumbling through a script. They absolutely care if the Twitter lynch mob starts gearing up.",2021-10-11 17:40:53
q5n9r5,👉 there's the door,2021-10-11 07:18:38
q5n9r5,Yeah they just screwed me out of an entire day in CDMX. I wish I knew this before I booked. 😱,2021-10-11 12:24:01
q5n9r5,Especially weird if you consider that this means a €5 Ryan Air comes with more legal assurance than any US airline ticket 🤔,2021-10-11 05:08:58
q5n9r5,"Oh man, that’s now how that works at all 🤦‍♂️ I’m getting real tired of this whole “natural immunity” ignorance.

You know what’s better than getting COVID to build a natural immunity? Not getting COVID.

Did you know vaccinated people who come in contact with a viral load can and probably will also build up a natural immunity in ADDITION to the vaccine immunity? All with zero or lower symptoms. It’s a win win you fucking dumb fuck. It also drastically lowers spread and chance of further more dangerous mutations.

Good luck with your potential future side effects from god knows what damage your body incurred from your COVID infection. That shit causes neural damage (most commonly seen as lose of taste and smell, yup, it got in your brain) and recent studies are suggesting increased risk of diabetes!!",2021-10-11 06:21:21
q5n9r5,"Why don’t you try to get a natural immunity to polio while you’re at it? LMFAO.

The worst part is that you *think you understand the science*. You are no where near capable of understanding it. Do you have any idea how complex the immune system is? Can you even name three immune cells (without googling?). Can you explain all of their functions? Do you even know what a “protein” is?

When you go to a dentist are you inspecting your own X-rays and telling the doctor what to do? This is why we have experts!!!! 😂🤦‍♂️😂🤦‍♂️

People like you are why we are still dealing with this shit. Thanks fuck head.",2021-10-11 06:39:49

mke9bx,"Damn!! I’m so sorry :( that really sucks.

mke9bx,"I am crying just to read you 😭💔 it’s really hard because as you say, material things are replaceable but the ones that involve our feelings are very hard to let go 😢 this happened when I was arriving back home from my first travel since C-19 so all the joy I had for an instant came into pieces with this situation. But my brother send me a little tale from Kafka that ends with “Everything you love will probably be lost, but in the end, the love will return in another way” I hope it helps you and I share it with you with all the respect and love I can 🙌🏼 so I hug you in the distance and eventually the love we had for our stuff will return in another way ❤️💫",2021-04-05 16:28:19

186e4im,"All companies are moving to this Customer Service model of never being available (“staffing issues and [insert proper business excuse like weather/increased service utilization]) and basically never conceding a customer’s valid points in order to reduce costs and force a customer to work EXTRA HARD to get a small pittance in return for their pain and efforts. 

It’s a true shame we’ve let things get to where they are now. The noose tightens around the proverbial consumers’ necks while companies like Delta get Uncle Sam to bail them out every 10-15 years. 
🤦‍♂️",2023-11-29 16:18:31
186e4im,Don’t waste your time. File a complaint with the DOJ. they are super fast in opening a case and advocating for you. Latam dicked me around on a flight I cancelled and [DOT](http://www.dot.gov/airconsumer) made them refund me PLUS extra money 🤷🏽‍♀️,2023-11-29 19:16:24

I was able to select my seat on Delta Airlines manage your reservation and it's been confirmed, got an email of confirmation with my seat selection few days later. I hope and pray I won't run into any of this mess.

We really need to do something but it would take such a large focused group that it’s damn near impossible and they know that hence they charge what they want and treat us like shit.

186e4im,This is what got me fired from AT&T after 9 years. I lost my patience with all the bullshit scripted phrases and fake tones of voice and I preferred to just fix their problems while being a pleasant human. It wasn’t good enough. I think I wanted to get fired though. 😂,2023-11-30 02:01:05

odlbk2,"I say this because **a)** Venice is not that big and **b)** because it's beautiful in a very different and unique way (hence why you should visit), but after a couple of days you get used to this and everything seems to look more of the same.

(Btw, if you go to Venice and then visit The Venetian in Vegas you'll laugh out loud at the cheesy fake monstrosity and you'll feel sorry for those that ride on the hotel's ""gondolas"". 🤦‍♂️)",2021-07-04 19:51:06

Don't be too concerned about the dog. He was only half outside the balcony half inside (added a pic on my profile to better illustrate his position).He didn't seem to be in any danger as he was constantly peeking inside the balcony probably looking at somebody that cared for him 🥰",2023-01-24 20:34:04

t5vn5p,"The city is amazing, but be wary of walking around the tenderloin, it’s not for the faint of heart, particularly at night. It’s basically what Fox News describes as the entirety of SF. Drug use, homelessness, crime, 💩 on the sidewalk, etc.  There are other rough areas but you most likely won’t be in those neighborhoods. The tenderloin is near major tourist centers though.

You can find the neighborhood on Google maps.",2022-03-04 00:53:20
t5vn5p,"When everyone from hobos to people wearing expensive suits get on the bus without paying idk it's pretty safe to say literally nobody cares. If it made a difference the drivers would say something but in my whole life living in the bay area I've never heard anything from them either 🤷. On the other hand where I live in SJ, the drivers won't let you on until you pay, way stricter here.",2022-03-03 18:49:39

t5vn5p,"Yep, it’s usually just “the City” or “SF”

I think the influx of people saying San Fran is rooted in the recent influx of people in the last 20-30 years and I think it’s gotten to the point where it’s a little more common. 

I don’t care enough to correct anyone, and I have to wonder, if enough people say it, long time local or not, is it still wrong? 🤷🏼‍♂️",2022-03-04 00:41:24

d5gnlh,"Been living here for almost two years, so a few tips

• when crossing a street, always assume there's a bike coming. Check left and right. Bike lanes are red, if you're walking on red floor, it's most likely a bike lane, so get out.

• rent a bike. Just make sure you follow the rules. Act like a car and you should be fine. Biking in Amsterdam is an experience of its own, and it's also the best way to get around the city.

• get into the small streets, that's where you'll get to feel the charm of the city. It's also a good way to avoid most of the tourists.

• look up and appreciate the architecture, it's something you don't see in America, and again, it's part of the charm of Amsterdam. 

• try the local beers. Dutch cuisine might be very poor (except for the pancakes (pannenkoeken) they're delicious), but the beers are top 👌

• bring a raincoat. Amsterdam weather is bipolar af, so chances that you get caught under the rain are very high. It's also quite windy, so umbrellas aren't always useful. 

• take a canal cruise. Might he touristy, but who cares, it's great to go through the canals on a boat.

• Amsterdam is quite safe, but the red light district attracts some shady individuals, so be careful, especially if you're drunk or high. 

• Amsterdam is very touristic, so stay alert for tourist traps. 

• I recommend at least one day to wake up at dawn so you can walk the empty streets with that morning light. It's beautiful. 

That's some tips to enjoy Amsterdam. Where to go? I'd say everywhere. It's a small city that's why with a bike it's the best way to move around, you can bike through the city in one day. Hope you enjoy it!",2019-09-17 16:32:59

9w6jwf,"Me too. Almost posted a picture the other day. Blue skies and sunny, but there were so many people bathing I couldn’t find a photo that didn’t have a face.  About two months ago. It was awesome. Had to walk for almost an hour up a switch back path, had no idea what I was going to find up there. What a pleasant surprise!

I didn’t come prepared with a bath towel and a swimsuit. Didn’t see anybody there that thought it was clothing optional.   Luckily, my boxer briefs were rayon-ish, and some sort of tropical print. I think I got away with it. Didn’t notice any strange looks, but who knows what they were thinking of me.   (so goddamn relaxing in that warm water, didn’t care too much 😎)

Oh, since I was a little embarrassed about my attire, I tried to go upstream away from the crowd. Dipped my toe in and it was near boiling.   

Figured out why this stream is so awesome. One hot stream comes in, and a separate cold stream joins it. People swim in the mix where it’s just right.     ",2018-11-11 22:56:40

I really wished we had gone to another village or two instead of the Chateau, which we visited via public transport and wouldn't recommend (unless you have a car).

vns8ny,🙋🏻‍♂️,2022-06-30 02:41:04
vns8ny,💯— I’ve found that the cheapest AirBnB with fees is often more expensive than some of the most expensive hotels. I’m back to staying at hotels when I travel as a result. And not only is a hotel cheaper but I can earn rewards from the chain and on my credit card bringing even more disparity between the options. If they don’t fix their fee structure they’ll quickly go away (exacerbating the coming housing bubble burst to boot!),2022-06-30 13:09:39
vns8ny,"Not condoning this or presenting this as a valid option for you….who knows, maybe it’ll help….but what worked the best for us was when we started staying at campgrounds and packing our favorite tent, sleeping pads, sleeping bags, cook our own food, it’s cheaper, and we sleep like babies in our own bedding and shelter which we know is clean. Plus the food thing helps with budget and you get to kinda eat your favorite options with less hassle as well as not having to worry about all the food borne illnesses we worry about when traveling. Hope this helps. 🤷🏻‍♂️",2022-06-30 04:06:41
vns8ny,Definitely agree! Sometimes the cleaning fee alone is $200 🙄,2022-06-30 13:34:19
vns8ny,"I have mixed feelings about it, but I just left an air bnb yesterday in Cancún, Mexico. My siblings and our nephew had a relaxing stay (a total of 6 of us) stayed in a super scenic area of Cancun for the cheap price of $750 for 10 days. Comparing that to last year when I went to Cancun with him and stayed at Emporio Resort for the price of $1,200 for two of us for 7 days. 🥲🫠

If it weren’t for air bnb we would’ve never been able to afford to drop $4k to house all of us in Cancun for that many days.",2022-06-30 03:23:53
vns8ny,Love using Air b&b in the UK ☺️ used it multiple times and had nothing but great experiences and great hosts,2022-06-30 01:19:30
vns8ny,I did my part recently by throwing up on an airbnb’s futon 👍,2022-06-30 01:56:10
vns8ny,Just like ANYTHING/everything else in the horrible capitalistic wasteland; It morphed into disgusting 🐎 💩,2022-06-30 03:25:48
vns8ny,yeah the fees are crazy but if you stay longer (a week or more) it usually balances out..also love the traveling with pets option on a lot of airbnb’s that hotels don’t have- that’s a mega bonus. the reviews thing doesn’t really bother me that much because it feels fair 🤷‍♀️since we both get rated..keeps everyone on their best behavior…usually,2022-06-30 11:08:23
vns8ny,"In several places recently I’ve been hearing from AirBNB owners of a massive collapse in rentals — and the main reported drive is the extreme cleaning fees. It also seems on the renter side, people had initially pivoted to just AirBnB. like every industry their will be some shakeups — and as a renter I consider AirBnBs just one more option. I’ve met some wonderful people in the AirBnB space, but as more and more of the rentals are by corporate types, or non-resident/non-local owners, I think there will be this transition. On one group I follow one person reported 9 out of 15 houses in her neighborhood are AirBnB’s now (and not a beach/resort type location). 

Just FWIW…

PS <Joke of the day seen on another group> someone was having trouble with large groups partying at two nearby AirBnBs — she changed her WiFi SSID to “FBI Surveillance” and there seem to be less issues…. 😂",2022-06-30 14:13:46
vns8ny,"They’re still good for unique locations and large groups. When you just need a couple nights in a random city you can’t beat the convenience of a hotel.

Also, children. Hotels are great for not worrying about my children destroying things. Not that my kids are that destructive but hotels seem to have this indestructible quality to them 😂.",2022-06-30 16:14:42
vns8ny,"I just had a great experience in Krakow with one, £25 a night and full little studio right in the centre! Can’t complain 😁",2022-06-30 16:16:54
vns8ny,"Stopped using it 3 years ago after booking an airbnb in new york. When we booked, ratings were great, after a few months there was a gas leak in the house, the gas was disabled and not fixed by our arrival which meant that we entered a no heating apartment in December with -15c outside. We had the power outage the first night and were told to minimise the use of the electricity 🤣 the fing host didn’t pick up any calls and we had no wifi 🤣 survived the night, called airbnb CS that offered us dumps for 2x the price as thet had no availability. After 2 hours of calling, talking, they agreed to offer a refund. Booked a nice hotel in Manhatta within an hour for the same price, as there were a ton of cancellations due to the cold weather. 

Have ventured out to airbnb since then to compare options, but it’s always ridiculously expensive and you have to deal with unprofessionalism of the hosts, weird checkin/out times etc. 

BTW booking.com offers apartments too, booked one last year in Belgium, it was great! And at least they have proper alternatives to offer if needed.",2022-07-01 09:41:24
vns8ny,"Exactly this. Last one I stayed at had a cleaning fee and a list of things to do before leaving. Take out the trash. Put towels in the washer. Wash the dishes. Strip the beds. 🙄 omg. 
I’ll go to a hotel next time.",2022-06-30 00:43:45
vns8ny,Bruh - you booked an air B and B in fucking Mexico 😂,2022-06-30 14:24:35

vns8ny,"We stayed at a place like that in Italy a couple years ago. Husband was like “nah, fam, I’m not leaving you shit” because of it not being legal for them to ask you to pay in cash. 😅",2022-06-30 20:19:17
vns8ny,Ew and that's extra gross because if all that cleaning is up to guests...you know most of them don't do it so the place was probably not cleaned before you got there 🤮,2022-06-30 13:12:16

Getting to riomaggiore was some 8 minutes. Riomaggiore to manarola just 1 minute etc. they are all connected by train tunnels.

I wished we were younger as we would love to do Gorilla trekking in Rwanda, but the hike at 8K altitude would kill us😛 Chobe is supposed to be great for elephants and glad you saw the dogs!

en58j2,"Not OP but I just hiked it a couple of weeks ago so hopefully can give some answers to your questions 🙂

We set out with the intention of doing the trek in 14 days, averaging somewhere around 16km a day with our longest day being around 27km and our shortest being 8.3km. However, we only did 143.9km of the approximately 260km, as I got mild to moderate frostbite on my toes while going over the pass on day 9, forcing us to get a jeep from Muktinath back to Pokhara on day 10, spending a night in Tatopani on the way back. This isn't typical, but we were walking through 1m thick snow on the pass at some points (and I didn't bring enough thick socks 🙄).

This is the first multi day trek that my friend and I had ever done and we found it to be generally pretty easy, with the only challenge being the altitude as you get higher up. Crossing Thorong La Pass was easily the hardest thing I've ever done, with the air being super thin, with both of us needing to stop every 5 minutes or so to catch our breath. For context we're both 21M and moderately fit. Neither of us trained at all, except for one 10km walk like a week out from leaving, just to get a feel for the weight of our packs.

If I was doing it again: more. merino. socks. I only took four pairs and as you get into higher altitude with snow (depending on when you go of course), it becomes very difficult to dry clothes and the reason I ended up with frostbite was due to the fact that I was wearing two pairs of wet socks in -30°C weather. I'd also recommend crampons for the descent down the pass, as it is quite slippery, even without snow I would imagine. 

The rest of the trek leading up to the pass was some of the most amazing scenery I've ever witnessed, with the trek at its best being a leisurely hike, and at it's worst, mildly tiring, with some steep ascents and humidity at lower altitude. Make sure you stock up on snacks before setting out each day, as even though villages are only separated by a few km, it can still take a couple of hours depending on steepness and weather conditions.

Overall the trek was easily one of the best things I've ever done and an incredible experience that I couldn't recommend enough. This is the itinerary we followed, it's super detailed and was an amazing help to us: https://stingynomads.com/annapurna-circuit-trek-itinerary/

Hopefully this has been somewhat helpful! Sorry OP if I stole your thunder, just wanted to give some insight into our slightly atypical experience! Happy trekking🙂",2020-01-11 13:54:52

en58j2,"Oh they're fine now! I mean still a little bit of numbness but compared to when I got down from the pass, way better. As soon as we arrived in Muktinath I spent about an hour brining them up to temperature with the help of the hostel staff. If we'd taken it easy I probably would have been able to finish the trek, but unfortunately we were in a bit of a rush, so I'd love to go back and do it again but at a slower pace in the future.

Hopefully I haven't scared you too much! It really comes down to me just being a massive idiot 🙃 Just make sure you take plenty of thick socks. Oh and waterproof boots probably wouldn't have hurt either 😂",2020-01-11 14:10:15

I could have spent a month just wandering around various neighborhoods in Seoul. The food is incredible, the people are kind, the street markets are ubiquitous and varied, the public transportation is painless, the shopping, the bathhouses, the experiences -- everything was great. 

Before Korea, I had only traveled internationally to European countries (I'm American). Even though I consider myself a pretty undemanding traveler, I had never been on a trip without experiencing *some* discomfort...until Korea. With the exception of the Czech Republic, it put everywhere else I've been to in Europe to shame.

123mwlk,"Kyoto Engine Ramen is very good. The broth is different from say a soy sauce based broth. It’s made of soy milk. I thought it sounded weird but omg… it works. It’s so light and just delicious. Get their spicy miso one! It’s not that spicy at all and gives a slight kick. So delicious. Try it out, especially if anyone in your party has a food allergy such as celiac (my boyfriend), vegans, vegetarian. They’re so accommodating and nice. There’s a wait though, we went right when they opened at 4:30pm. When we left there was a line. Food comes quick though and great service. They do sake tastings, my boyfriend ordered a wine cup sized glass of sake. It was great lol. We did a tasting with 2 other tables of travelers. It was a lot of fun. 

Oko- Fun Okonomiyaki Bar: it’s a TINY place in Osaka near Dotombori ran by a cute little Japanese lady. Only about 8 seats and there’s always a line. Opens at 6pm so plan to get in line at 5:30 lol. Very accommodating to food allergies as well. She’s very sweet and so cute! Also got to know other travelers here and had a great time with them. Drinks were only 180 yen each and you serve them yourself. I guess she goes by the honor system lol. I loved this place.

Sorry for any typos, it’s 6am here and I’m exhausted from walking 13 miles in Kyoto yesterday 🫢😂 hope you have a fun trip!!",2023-03-27 21:29:53
123mwlk,Right? I just wanted to share this beautiful place with others and didn’t expect so many negative comments. Oh well! I’ll just go back to looking out my window at all this beauty and these people can stay bitter 😛,2023-03-27 21:58:22
123mwlk,"Same! We were supposed to go mid March 2020 lol 😆

Im from the US as well. They don’t require masks anymore BUT 90% of people still wear them. I only wear them in crowds and when entering the trains and buildings. Sometimes I don’t wear it and no one seems to care.",2023-03-28 00:15:34

10e0wsh,It was a Vietnamese version 😉 Built for the dunes !,2023-01-17 09:15:05
10e0wsh,It was fairly deserted - maybe a 15 tourists roaming around. Also the guards caused a bit of confusion by closing one side of the entrance but not telling clearly about the other one 😅,2023-01-17 15:05:35

10e0wsh,We were on a mission 🚀 😅,2023-01-17 20:08:38
10e0wsh,Correction : trains very much pass and we witnessed it. You are not allowed to roam freely and need to be seated by a cafe owner to ensure you don’t get killed 😅 that’s about it,2023-01-17 04:06:22
10e0wsh,"We travelled almost 24 hours by flight so realistically day 1-2 was a right off of short walks to see some sights IVO District 1 and some rooftop pool time with lots of sleep. We also did a day trip to the Chu Chi Tunnels and Mekong Delta that was a fairly long day. The 5th day was a hybrid travel day back to the airport and flight to Phu Quoc.

I never even had time to visit the War remnants museum which was a tad disappointing but I've learned to drop things off the itinerary when travelling with children because nobody has fun if everyone is cranky and tired. 😅",2023-01-18 01:04:28
10e0wsh,Precisely - they basically missed telling you to enter from the opposite end of the track 🥹,2023-01-17 06:54:17
10e0wsh,Do it 😃,2023-01-17 09:16:32
10e0wsh,I wouldn’t really - maybe another trip for the Ho Chi Minh trail and the son doong caves 😃,2023-01-17 09:05:58
10e0wsh,It’s a UNESCO World Heritage sight along a historic trade route. The buildings are indeed old and rustic and not reconstructed entirely. I did not know this while being there - thanks for question 🙌🏻,2023-01-17 23:06:16
10e0wsh,Mui Ne and Hoi An 💫,2023-01-18 00:51:14
10e0wsh,I liked Bana Hills surely 👌 But didn’t stay at Da Nang.,2024-03-31 08:07:14
10e0wsh,"Okay, then yes, don't take a scooter and lean towards the organised half day / day trips. From HCM northwards you have Dalat, Hoi An, Hue and Phong Nha & Ninh Bình as some of the key location areas. I would skip Dalat and make my way to Hoi An for 1 or 2 nights and from there to Phong Nha but it really depends on what you want to get out of the trip. I can't imagine you want to go caving for the day and head down a zipline when you are pregnant 😉 Hoi An is very chilled. Ninh Bình also. Hue is a very historic city with some of the best cuisine in Vietnam. 

Wouldn't waste much more time in HCM if I were you. I actually prefer Hanoi in comparison.

Most of all, take care and go at a easy pace given your pregnancy.",2023-06-17 06:49:17
10e0wsh,"So pleased you are having a great time!! Can highly recommend a road trip.

Not sure about your dietary requirements but there is a place called Pub With Cold Beer (😅). And they cook a chicken for you there on the spot. Yes, you would choose the roaming chicken, not for everyone but a unique experience. It's a bit out the way though. 

I also think there is a little botanical garden there but it involves trekking through jungle and I don't think that's suitable for you at the moment.

Have you taken a boat yet? I guess you could organise something like that? Otherwise just use the time to chill. But if you are restless you can always move further north to somewhere like Ninh Binh. Otherwise, just relax and enjoy the slow pace of life there :) 

Where did you end up staying in Phong Nha?",2023-06-20 06:00:41
10e0wsh,"Awesome! Sounds like you had a good taste of Phong Nha. Incredible landscape, right? And fair play to you for pushing it through with the pregnancy. You're a real trooper!

Enjoy Hue, look out for their speciality dishes if you get the time. Safe travels ✌️",2023-06-20 08:06:37

12lpyuy,That is really beautiful wow I wanna go 😍,2023-04-14 22:05:56
12lpyuy,Looks scary! I don’t know if they are aggressive but I do know I wouldn’t want to be that close to something that big. 😳😰,2023-04-14 19:35:14
12lpyuy,"Bali is overwhelmingly beautiful but it was heartbreaking to see half naked influencers climbing on top of temples to take an insta shot. I’ve been travelling since my youth and I do it for memories and mainly because world amazes me. I cannot imagine traveling for a social status  and I like Reddit for that particular reason - I am anonymous here. ☺️

However, if there was an ‘off season’ of the actual off season, I’d happily travel around Bali.",2023-04-14 20:22:56

pcm4fj,"To be honest most of London is a dump other than central, theres a general culture of arrogance and i find people to be alot more suspicious of you than anywhere else ive been in the country. Not to mention places like Bethnal Green where if you're white, people tend to treat you like a bit of an outsider (i was lost there once, people literally refused to talk to me). My experiences up North are completly different, people are nearly always willing to give you a hand or have a bit of a chinwag and theres generally good banter, aside from the usual chip on shoulder type remarks (southern fairies! 🤣) i never had any problems. I live in Kent 30 miles from Central London, but id rather take the 5 hour bus to Blackpool. Not to hate on the capital too much but i just find it ridiculous how overrated it is as a city especially if you're not well off and want to go for a simple night out, the skyline is beautiful tho, and the history is awesome.",2021-08-27 18:18:42

my6vg5,"Sure!

We landed at Jaen arriving from Lima. We took a bus to Pedro Ruiz (bumpy ride 😀) and then a taxi to Cocachimba where our hotel was located.

We used Cocachimba as a base for visiting the region, usually on a private car with driver: Chachapoyas town, Kuelap...

You can also fly directly to the small Chachapoyas airport on a small-ish plane, but is more expensive and is usually sorrounded by clouds.

We did not visit Ecuador, though.",2021-04-25 15:25:27

my6vg5,"Not really, it was an incredibly boring week because there was really nothing for us to do 😅 we spent an entire month in northern Peru much like that after crossing at La Balsa. We kept trying to see places (like Gocta and Kuelap) we'd heard about but finding that there was no way for us to get there and a general confusion from whoever we asked around why we'd want to or what exactly we were doing there in the first place (I'm sure my not-that-amazing Spanish didn't help either, though). We went from bad guesthouse to bad guesthouse on long windy bus rides, meeting very few other travelers and not really having anything to do for the whole month, one of the low points of my year of travels tbh. There's definitely such a thing as going too far off the beaten path while travelling, and personally I had a much better time in places where there was a bit more tourist infrastructure. I'm glad to hear that your experience was much better!",2021-04-26 03:04:20
my6vg5,"You’re welcome, here’s some more 😂:

You will be walking for hours and hours at high altitude so if you want to enjoy it and not struggle hour by hour I would suggest you get in decent shape. It’s not impossible but it’s much more enjoyable when you aren’t focused on any lack of fitness you may have. Also proper shoes and hiking socks are a must, Darn Tough socks or something similar.

In my experience there are more solo females traveling than solo males and I haven’t heard any negative stories other than theft due to someone not paying attention to their belongings. I meet lots of travelers because I also travel and have had an Airbnb here for 3 years prior to Covid and have hosted lots of solo females.

In Cusco where you would be starting any trek to MP it’s advisable to skip rainy season, which is December to March. 

For me longer trips are better, you could see Lima and eat some of the world’s best food while visiting Huaca Pucllana, Museo Larco, the colonial downtown that has convents, churches etc. Alternately you could go to Arequipa which is probably the most beautiful city here. Homes and buildings made from hand-cut volcanic ash stone called sillar. Really beautiful and there are volcanoes you can say hike or take cooking classes or play with alpacas.

I live in Ancash where all the tallest mountains are, the Cordillera Blanca section of the Andes. Lots to see there as well and we have treks like Santa Cruz or the Huayhuash, which is even more beautiful than you can imagine.

Peru has it all honestly, costa, Sierra, selva and desert. Beaches, mountains, jungles and deserts, all 4 climatic zones. You can dune buggy outside Lima or go to an oasis or surf.

I’ve never used tour companies because I live here (4 years) and speak Spanish so haven’t needed any. I could find a few for you I’m sure.

It depends on what you’re going to do but if you pay for your tour ahead of time that will cut down on cash needs. Outside of restaurants in Cusco/Lima/Arequipa it’s a cash heavy society so depending on how long your staying a safe budget is like $50/day or less if you’ve paid for rooms and tours in advance. You can spend a lot more but that’s a decent base. You can eat lunch here with a full meal for $3-5, called menu.

I’ve been to Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina, & Chile. Also lots of Central America, Europe, parts of Asia but Peru is my favorite so far in South America. I’ve been living here since 2017.",2021-04-26 03:33:43

It's ok to do ""touristy things"" because guess what, you ARE a tourist no matter what.

Tourism is a double-edged sword. Does a lot of good, but also a lot of bad. You can control the former, not necessarily the latter.

Don't constantly complain about hassling and haggling. It's ok to not enjoy it. But accept that this, too, is part of that ""other culture"" you claim you wanted to explore. Learn how to deal with it.",2023-11-27 15:00:26

Maybe this has to do with perceived class/colorism (I'm a mestizo Latino), but I never get pegged for a tourist when I'm in Latin America or Southeast Asia. They only realize that I'm a tourist once I start speaking heavily accented Spanish or Thai. 

Thailand was really interesting because some things I read online/in tourist guides ended up not applying to me (I'm guessing because of my skin tone). For example, I wasn't approached by scammers or bar girls/sex workers, nor did I pay tourist prices (unless they asked for Thai ID. It was a welcome surprise. I actually asked a few Thai people why this was, and some of them said,

""You look Thai. I thought you were Thai. Most people probably think you're Thai, so they won't try to upcharge you like they do the foreigners."" 

The dynamic I experience in Asia is really interesting because they don't have a ton of Latino tourists. Heck, people in Vietnam and Thailand seem to forget that Latinos exist. It also made me realize how representation in media I'd actually important. Latinos make up about 20% of the US population, and nearly 1/3 of my generation, yet people in Asia are still surprised when I tell them I'm American.

i totally agree with you that as long as it’s fine with my spouse i don’t care at all. i’ve gone on trips with mixed male/female groups and with a female buddy and he has no problem, and if i wanted to go with a male buddy he has said before it’s fine. just hasn’t happened yet lol. i wouldn’t care the other way around either with him traveling with various groups and me staying at home, except i’d be jealous i’m not traveling 😅 the only time he’s been wary is with solo travel due to safety, but with good communication we’re good.

A 11\~13 hour flight to Japan from Europe can have an impact of 500kg (because of newer planes I guess 🤷)... and for most that would be a once a lifetime thing, not every year trip.

Also, to put it into perspective, the impact of such trip (there and back) would be same as eating 170g of beef every day for a year.

So not owning a car, not having children, using AC/heating sparingly, eating mostly vegetarian, recycling, etc. over the year **can** IMHO compensate for such a trip with spare.",2023-11-27 17:52:48

yf3tw4,"After going in the fall, I really don’t know if I could go during any other season. The colors were UNREAL. We made the stave churches a priority because anything could happen to them. There are only 28 left of the original 2000! And we were the only ones there, for all of them. It’s kind of crazy how forgotten some thing can become. Though, these are well off the beaten path. However, if you go during the summer, you can actually go inside the churches. Norway does shut a lot of stuff down on the off-season. 

So I would say late spring/early fall are the best times to go! Less people, betting pricing, beautiful colors. 

Other must-sees, the fjords. Typical response maybe but I felt like I was in another world. The fjords are what I hope my heaven look like. 🏔️🏔️🏔️",2022-10-28 03:03:20

5jnxpz,"Bruh, you need to calm down.  It was just meant to be tongue in cheek as if the movie really happened.  :/

I actually watched it tonight, and that's why I brought it up.  But, on top of being a dick, you're also not entirely technically correct, and, even worse, you could have easily googled the quotes before comment.

* >Radio newscaster: In Bodega Bay early this morning, a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill. One little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but the majority of children reached safety. We understand there was another attack on the town. But this information is rather sketchy. So far, no word has come through to show if there have been further attacks.

* While talking at the cafe:

 >Deke: I didn't know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.

* I can't seem to find the one where Melanie is talking to her father on the phone and asks Deke for the name, but regardless both Deke and the Newscaster state the school is in Bodega Bay.

Alternatively, you're right that the real life location, Potter Schoolhouse, is in Bodega, however the street where the children are running away from the crows was partially filmed in Bodega Bay.  On top of the that, a definite large portion of the movie was filmed at the Universal Studio's back lot, so I don't see how any of this matters.

Lastly, I incorrectly stated that the movie debuted in 1960 (Confusion with Psycho.) instead of 1963.  Why didn't you add that mistake?  At least then you would've been a correct dick instead of just a dick.

64xfj7,"Thank you so much for your in depth reply! Really appreciate it. 
I will break it down a bit for you! 

---

Just to give you a bit more insight, might help you understand a bit more who I am! :) 
 
I am a 26 year old guy from the Netherlands who currently lives in Belgium.
I am single for.. over 5 years now! I haven't been open for a relation.. long story!   
I work as a HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) mechanic for the company of my father. I don't earn a fortune, but enough to come around. 
I do hope to work in a PC store in a few years, but that's for later.  

I used to play video games a lot, this is where I met the two lovely girls that I'll meet in Zagreb. But right now, I don't make much time for it. 
I am very much still a PC nerd and love PC hardware. I help people over on /r/buildapcforme a lot. Sadly, because of being very busy, I don't have as much time. I still put out a few suggestions every week though! :)  
I also love going on walks with my dogs in the ""small"" park that I live nearby. 

I've recently gain a lot of interest for photography. I plan to buy a ""good"" all round camera to take with me on my trip. 

I actually plan to make a YouTube video of my holiday. Because I will travel alone, I have all the time to make a lot of pictures. I also will try to record small parts with my action camera. I hope to get a very nice video together with short clips and a handful of still pictures. I have a cheap one that I bought for Malta. Which was my holiday in 2016!  

^(The only reason why I want to make this is to reap all the karma in /r/Croatia & /r/travel.)

I love metal, classical & any music with instruments. I also listen to chillstep & trance every now and then, but often not very long. Currently listening to [Sorrows Passing - Sad Orchestral Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXov3vClscc&feature=push-u&attr_tag=ERX85eIJ2xE1f8mW-6) from Peter Gundry.  
I would actually love to find some local music anywhere and record it to include in my holiday video! :) 

---

>  Also you should visit Opera club in Zagreb if youre into that kind of stuff  (Im there right now, perfect for people in their 20ies)

Not much my cup of tea! But thanks for the suggestion. I don't plan to go clubbing at all, won't have time for that! Also, I hardly ever do that here at home.. I don't have any friends! xD   
So going solo into a club, yeah.. won't happen easily!   

> what I do know is that there are some really good wineries in Vrbnik (a very cute town) which is on the island of Krk. Since Mali Lošinj is a top destination on Kvarner (northern part of our coastline just beneath Istra) and I highly recommend that you visit it, you should check out Vrbnik since it is on the way to Lošinj.

That's a little bit of the route that I currently have in my head. But I'll check it out.   
I'll be in Zadar so I can probably grab a ferry to Mali Lošinj? 

> Many people come to Croatia to eat fancy food at expensive restaurants, however I think that the cheaper food tastes even better and especially the one of Bosnian or Turkish origin.

Well, I can't afford expensive restaurants anyway, so that's good!  
I'll take my two friends from Zagreb out for dinner though, so hopefully I can find a good restaurant with not too expensive prices.  

I am very much aware of the local food being amazing, so I certainly want to give it a try. I'll probably go out to a restaurant ~7/9 times or so during my 18 (20 if I include the plane days;p) day trip. So about half of the evenings.  

I don't plan to actually go too often to restaurants. I'll buy my own food in supermarkets and try to make simple dishes in my hostels whenever possible.  

> In Zagreb you should visit Marenda (traditional Dalmatian food) or Magazinska Klet (barbecue) or, my favourite, Sofra (Bosnian cusine).

Absolutely perfect, thank you so much! I'll have to make a decision.. ♥ I love BBQ food, but I might have to consider Sofra. Argh, I'll ask my friends as well. 

>  As for eating in Dalmatia, do not listen to TripAdvisor since many people write fake reviews and also do not eat in old towns since those restaurants usually do not serve fresh food.

Copy! I generally don't listen to reviews too much, I mostly look at the menus and a few pictures if possible. My brother and sister both studied to become chefs, they've given me tips for how to know if a restaurant is good. ""small menu, with simple food = very good!"" 
 
Of course, I have to find a reference somewhere. I am sure that most local, not very popular restaurants will serve me well.  

I'll avoid old town restaurants, thank you! :) 

> Now, I'm pretty sure that you are planning to rent a car and then head from Zagreb along the coastline down to Dubrovnik which is really smart, just make sure that you have a good GPS device since many people get lost in the Plitvice lakes area.

I actually do not. I don't have a driver's license yet! :(  
It's also much cheaper to travel by bus. As said above, I don't have a huge budget..  

I know that having a car is absolutely awesome so that you can just go to wherever you want. I will just have to do with public travel. 

> The best thing you can do in Croatia is rent a boat and a person who knows the area really well who will take you to many beaches on our islands where you will be able to have absolute privacy and maximum comfort in the middle of nowhere. RENTING A SMALL BOAT IS A MUST.

This was the plan, at least for one day. I will see where I can find a place and people that want to join me on a day of ""relaxing"". I will hopefully meet some people in the hostels that I am staying.  

I'll have a look for sure, any islands you recommend? I currently have Vis, Mljet, Hvar & Long Island / Kornati on the planning. 

> Our country is very small. but it provides many fun activities. I think that 18 days is totally enough for you to get to Dubrovnik or Mostar or wherever you're headed to; just make sure you don't waste your time in hotels.

Hah! It's not thaaat small. I really wish I could visit Pula and the amphitheater. That is something I've never seen in my life.  
But I like to not ""rush"" myself from place to place. 

I won't stay much in my hostels! But obviously will try to socialise a little bit. I am going to be on my own, so.. 

I am absolutely going to the parks. Plitvice and Krka are in the planning. Will probably visit a couple more if possible! 

> The way to get around the crowd on Plitvice is to rent a small boat which is perfect for going under the waterfalls and overall having a little bit of privacy which is not that common over there lol.

Hah, I had no idea you could do that. I will actually have at least 2 days for Plitvice planned. One day with my friend from Zagreb and the next day for on my own. I am very much aware that it's going to be crowded. I just have to deal with it and make the best from it.  

I had no idea that you could rent a boat. I'll have a look at this, thanks! 

> Makarska is not very special and it's mostly for people who only come exclusively to Makarska and don't go anywhere else. If I were you, I would definitely skip it.

Thanks! I might skip it then. I'll be in Split for at least 4/5 days. So I could perhaps stay a bit longer than move from Split right to Mostar. 

> You should also visit Trogir which is near Split, just due north. And there you should rent a boat and go to nearby islands like Brač, Šolta and Drvenik (this is the best way to experience my country).

Absolutely! I am certainly going to visit islands near Split. I'll again have to look at it :) 

> Perhaps you also spot some dolphins.

NO WAY!! If I would spot dolphins, I would go crazy.. That would be soo amazing.  
Do you know any location where they are often seen? I certainly would spend a whole day to try and spot some dolphins. 

> The other places you've mentioned here are all worth a visit. If you don't have any experience around horses then horseback riding will be quite boring and going kayaking and zip lining will be much more fun, however you should know that every tourist does that kind of activities and, because of that, the prices are high.

I have 7 years of horse back riding experience under my belt. I am trying to find a place where we can go to a bit more challenging parkour. I love riding on a horse, especially in the nature. It's just extremely relaxing for me. 

I am very much aware of the high prices for kayaking and zip lines. I was actually surprised a lot. I didn't expect the prices to be this high, but well.. it is what it is and I just have to eat a bit more noodles for a couple of weeks so I can afford it all. 

> I've tried explaining this the best I could fitting your character as you seem to be a much more chill-drink-eat people then the adventurous, get off the beaten track type.

Hah, well I indeed am a fairly chill person, I think? I do however like to be a bit adventurous during my holidays. Thus why I am planning to go kayaking, ziplining, horseback riding, etc.   
I also enjoy some local food and beverages. But it's not extremely important, just nice to experience compared to my boring food that I eat at home! 

I will spend the next few weeks to try and plan everything as best as possible. 

#Thank you so much, I will certainly use all this information as best as possible.

15tbma8,"New Orleans. First thing that happened was getting followed by 4 different pushy men, while I was trying to find my hotel, that would not leave me alone (it took me 3 hours to find my hotel because there were 6 of the same hotel within like 2 miles 😂) while I was on my hotel trek, there were 3, unattended to, sewers backing up into the road. They were spitting sewage out of the hole straight to the road. It was so nasty. The river stunk so badly and it was a nasty brown. 

When I finally made it to my room, I shook it off, took a shower and was still determined to have a good time. When I got to the parking lot, controlled by a 3rd party not the hotel, there was a boot on my car. I had paid for parking.. this wasn’t right. Checked my bank account and yep $20 to the parking company. Went into their app (the only way to pay) and there was no phone number or contact information of any kind no way to get the boot off, except pay $200 to the app and it would unlock automatically. No chance of getting someone to come, just fucked. So I had no choice but to pay the $200. I parked 3 blocks away at a parking lot with an attendant after that. I went to Bourbon street. Everyone was drunk and disrespectful. I was groped, followed and hollered at constantly. I just wanted to stroll down the street and get some food. 
Every single trash can was overflowing. People were spilling drinks on each other and just throwing their trash on the ground. An insane amount of disgusting over-the-top crossed-the-line PDA. 
None of the restaurants looked good enough so I just left, super disheartened. I just turned into a residential area. I decided to go on a walk in a normal local neighborhood. 
I immediately noticed how dilapidated the houses were. Not far from one of the busiest tourist spots in the city. I noticed a lot of the houses were leaning as well. Sinking into the ground sideways? It still was the first place with a decent energy. It was very pretty even if it was completely falling apart. 
I turned down a totally empty street, except for a guy out on the sidewalk in front of his house (it was 11 pm at this point) behind a table, with an apron on and a giant metal pot on the table, it had one of those red and white checkered tablecloths. Anyway he waved at me and yelled “want some shrimp?” And I was like hell yeah and ran over there because I just wanted some good seafood and I was starving. I bought a bowl of shrimp for $10 and I asked him about the houses leaning. He said that the ground was swampy so the houses were sinking, than he shared that everyone had an awful mold problem too. We chatted for a while then I took the shrimp back to my car. It was the most delicious thing ever. The next day I went to that nasty smelly river and decided NOT to wait 6 hours for beignets. It all sucked, and pissed me off that the town doesn’t seem to be taking great care of their residents and make them put up with nasty tourists not giving a shit about the place and treating it like a trash can. Fuck New Orleans. Don’t recommend unless you can find shrimp guy with a big pot of his grandmas recipe.",2023-08-18 04:50:00

15tbma8,"> there should be another condition called “reverse Paris Syndrome” because everyone i’ve heard that expected Paris to be bad were pleasantly surprise to find out it’s actually a great city.

I’ve experienced both conditions with Paris. 😄 My first visit around 2000, I did not understand the appeal Paris. Architecturally stunning, but the food was meh, and the biggest detractor for me was how unpleasant the people were. 

Fast forward 15 years, my partner and I were planning an extended trip to Europe and he wanted to include Paris. The second time around was a 180 of my first experience, and probably had to do with stepping outside the obvious tourist traps. We found amazing food and weirdly, people were more pleasant the second time around. 

From there on I just temper my expectations for every new city I visit.",2023-08-17 16:55:59
15tbma8,"I see what you mean, though when I mentioned I was going there so many people said they'd loved it and how wonderful it was. When I started to research it, I read such great things about to too (guess I shouldn't believe what I read 😅).
I wish I'd spent more time in Naples, there was so much to do and see - not sure my waistline could have taken much more though!",2023-08-17 11:46:30

15tbma8,"Exactly! Omg I could have years and is still not get bored of beautiful London. And thing is, I will have a few years, moving there soon 😎.

I adore London. It's a fun city. Historical, full of vibes.",2023-08-17 13:36:33
15tbma8,"I wrote a whole thing why I didn’t fall in love with it, and deleted it.

I think it boiled down to how unfriendly the people are. And that was everywhere - tourist spots, local spots, dive bars, watering holes, on the train, on the  ski lifts, in the store, and in the restaurant.

Nobody interacted with each other. Nobody mingled. No bartender engaged in conversation with you. The waiter didn’t give a shit how the food was. The locals weren’t throwing you suggestions on must visit spots. You didn’t have the group next to you passing a shot your way just because. We had spots we couldn’t get into because we were American. We had spots we got into, but the Asian tourists behind us were bounced for being too brown. 

I’ve met Bulgarians at a shit Philly dive bar on a Monday, and called out sick the next day just to drive them down the shore. They were going to AC, and I couldn’t allow that for first impression 😂",2023-08-17 19:58:36
