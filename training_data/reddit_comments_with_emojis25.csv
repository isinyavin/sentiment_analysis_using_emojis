She even grasped the babies (flipper?) in her mouth to show her overwhelming l💓ve and excitement.

11x7y71,"Do animals have feelings?

I agree that they do.

I truly believe 💯 % that animals have feelings.

Anyone who has a pet or has __been around animals know this to be true.__

I think the idea that animals don't / can't feel (either psychologically or physically) was a myth started by people trying to justify animals being given / taken for clothing, food, labor, trade, or the slaughter house, etc.

The thought process was:

Animals can't feel or understand pain or love, so, therefore, whatever we decide to do them is OK.

Not to be sarcastic to someone who might be offended?

All you have to do is go to [Google](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=do+animals+have+feelings) and you will note documents, films, pictures and stories of animals that are actually experiencing feelings all over the place. 

It's out there, and all just waiting for the world to see.

uo3fa4,"What do you do if you see a cougar versus a bear? 

I spend a lot of time researching this stuff because I am a mountain biker, snowboarder, trail runner, and also a park ranger in the PNW.

And I have lived in the most rural parts of Oregon for my entire life where we have a thriving cougar population. That is because we have hardly any wolves, so the cougar get all the deer. 

These days I spend a majority of my time in major urban natural areas where we also have cougar encounters. Ecologists have told me that the urban environment in Portland has more biodiversity than Mt. Hood. Powell Butte (native oak Savannah ecosystem) is a common place, as well as Forest Park (the biggest park in America) when they are hunting the migrating elk coming in from the coast. 

Do not think you’re safe just because you’re in a more urban environment. 

First thing to do if it is a cougar (same with bear) is you are to try to get as big as possible. Make sure to scream and yell, but the biggest difference when dealing with a cougar is whatever you DO NOT crouch down, or turn your back to it. 

Sign to the big kitty to pounce. 

Next.. Try to find a stick for a weapon to defend yourself, or better yet grab your bear spray. If you have to spray a line of defense in front of you. If you spray too close to any eyeballs it can cause permeant blindness, but that is the only way it would permanently damage the animal. It is a better option than a gun for that reason. 

Practice using the stuff before you have an actual encounter. I am pretty sure you can buy canisters just full of water that allow you to get used to it. We had some fake pepper spray in our Park Ranger Academy to practice with. 

Did you ever wonder why us park rangers like to walk with big sticks? It is not only to help us walk. 

Finally.. While trying to do this you should also be walking backwards slowly. 

Biggest piece of advice I can give to avoid one of these encounters:

Biologists I follow say to NEVER EVER be quiet while adventuring in the forest. What you do NOT want to do is scare a cat, so they say to softly hum music to yourself or talk if with people. If I am by myself with my dogs I play music on my speaker somewhat softly, and make sure their collars are always jingling. Just turn it down when you are around people so you do not ruin their experience. 

The one biologist I follow is a woman who does solo trips in the forest monitoring bear for months at a time. She is my inspiration, and she absolutely insists on bear spray. 

I come across people ALL THE TIME running solo in the wee hours only miles away from where we had a woman get killed by one recently out in Mt. Hood early in the morning. They’ll often say to me “Sorry I did not see or hear you there… I was listening to headphones and meditating while running.” 🤦‍♀️ 

Sometimes I wonder if people have a death wish.

What to do if it is a bear? 

Biggest difference is to NEVER look at it in its eyes it is a sign to them you are a threat. This goes for dogs as well. Unsure of a dog’s behavior? Do not look at it in its eyes.

I have a mountain right behind my backyard at my childhood home, and I have heard one scream before in the middle of the night. It sounds like a baby being murdered. I will never forget that sound. 

We stayed up all night listening to it on the porch. The next day we found a bloody deer head on our chicken coop, and the rest of the body across the street. 

They can come real close. 

We knew it was a cougar because of the screaming dying baby sound, and the paw tracks we found had no claw marks. That is because kitty’s have retractable claws. 

We have only had one cougar attack that I know of in this state during my life-time. 

BUT… with climate change making it harder for these guys I worry that more attacks will be on the rise as they get more desperate for food and water.

Also we have never seen this level of use in the PNW forests before because there are a lot of new people (with zero experience) coming into these areas trying to find solitude. 

Remember you are entering their home. 

Educate yourself before you go out into these remote areas. One cougar’s territory is 100 miles. They live solitary lives when they are not mating or parenting, so every cougar each has a 100 mile range that they protect, and they are very territorial… 

For instance we teenagers once unknowingly camped way to close to one. 

When we were all partying in the tent at night I heard a cougar come charging and grunting near our tent to retrieve a kill it had stored near our camp. It thought we were gunna take it, and it was pissed. The most terrifying thing ever! I thought we were done for, and no one else heard it because they were partying. I think it was a cougar because of the grunts I heard, but I will never really know. 

There are an estimated 5,000 cougars living in Oregon. 

We often see them way before they see us, and they are always watching us. This video is a perfect example of that.",2022-05-12 18:56:07

I’ve never seen a big cat but I have encountered both sharks and crocs while surfing. I’ve also encountered a grizzly while hiking. What I learned is that your instinct/training takes over in these situations. When I was 20 yards down the trail from a big ole bear, it was too late to think about how we should respond in this situation. Even though my partner and I had discussed exactly what we’d do if we met a grizzly (literally 15 min before we met one!) it was still a shocking moment where I had a hard time falling back on what I had read and practiced.

Yes, cats kill *a lot* of birds. But the species of birds they kill are, on average, a fuck of a lot smaller than owls. 

Owls will kill cats given the chance, but the certainly don't need to dive bomb a cat to rip out their jugular. 

Let's just *say* the cat gets the pounce on the owl.

The cat is on the owls back trying to get through their much, *much* denser plumage. 

The owl will just turn their head around, bite the neck, and rip. 

Cat doesn't stand a chance. Like I said, the cat might kill the owl b/c of a few broken bones, but the owl will shred the cat every single time.",2020-07-22 14:38:19
alrxdy,You & your hawk are awesome. 💵 ,2019-01-31 20:27:30
alrxdy,"Alright, OP - I have a story to share about hummingbirds. I fully admit, however, that  they're nowhere near as awesome as the fine specimen of a bird that you helped.  
  
Here's the hummingbird story...  
  
My apartment has a deck that looks out over a park by a river (2nd story) and hummingbirds have been coming to my feeder for several years. They're very territorial so it can get a little heated when multiple females show up for food. One female in particular - which I swear is the same one that's migrated back here for the past 3-4 years - showed up for a meal last Spring and 2 other females literally ganged up on her.  
  
*Side note:* She has a unique beak b/c it's broken a little shorter than normal and there's a chip in the beak that helps to identify her. This is the reason I believe it's the same bird the last several years. Truthfully, I have no idea but I've taken pics w/ my Canon DSLR and it sure seems like the same bird.  
  
Anyway, I felt terrible for her because the other 2 hummingbirds were constantly dive-bombing her every single time she showed up to eat. Sometimes they'd even do it when I was sitting out there just a few feet away. I tried to stay out of it (let nature do its thing) but it was becoming increasingly difficult because there were times when they'd come close to hitting *me* too. And then it happened -- one of them hit her so hard that she fell onto my lap as I sat in a chair *(a folding chair used for camping - the feeder was hanging 3-4 feet above me and about a foot outside the deck fencing).*  
  
We were both stunned! I didn't move and just sat there so she could shake off the hit to a defenseless feeder (a football reference for those who know) and then take off for her nest. Almost 5 minutes later (seemed like forever) - and as the fucking asshole humming-bullies continued to circle the area, she decided to jump up off my leg and hover in front of me for a few seconds while looking at me and then she flew like she'd never flown before ... she was flying to freedom! Of course, she was chased.  
  
At that point - **I ... was ... pissed!** 😤😡😆 The other 2 humming-bastards had never even eaten out of my feeder. They must have had a nest nearby and were trying to protect the area around it. I'm not sure. The thing is - they were flying in from a tree about 30 yards away ... seems like plenty of space for those ruthless, gutless, yellow-bellied, scaredy birds! I couldn't just sit on my ass and watch those assholes gang up on that poor, sweet, hungry mother-to-be for the entire Spring and Summer.  
  
So - I put on my red jogging shorts, a red shirt, and a red hat (hummingbirds love the color red) and hung out for a while one Saturday afternoon and evening. She kept coming back - kept getting chased away - but I could tell she was getting used to me because she'd fly inside the fenced deck area near my sliding doors to use me as protection. Most birds don't come that far into the deck area.  
  
At that moment, I'd become The Hummingbird Bodyguard. And I wasn't going to let her down! *Queue Whitney Houston...*  
  
The next afternoon, I sat down on one side of my deck so the side wall of the building would hide me as much as possible. Remember - this is a small deck outside of my apartment. When the nice female showed up to eat, she flew around first - searching to see if she was followed - and, after a minute of searching, she decided to give it a try.  
  
Sure enough, I could see the other coward humming-turds in the tree getting ready to fly like bullets toward her from behind. That's when I initiated **Operation: Bring the Pane!** I'd removed an old pane of glass from a panoramic picture frame, cleaned it like I had OCD, and then held on to one side of it as I slowly moved it into place between a sweetheart of a hummingbird eating at the feeder and those asshole humming-b!tches.  
  
The glass isn't thick and isn't very heavy but it was almost to the point where I couldn't hold it anymore. Then - the attack came. And *then* - 2 b!tch humming-bullies flew full speed into the glass hitting it so hard that they damn near fell 10 feet down to the ground! They recovered, though, and flew away. Funny thing was, after standing out there a couple more times the next few days, I didn't see those bullies anymore and she was *finally* able to eat on a regular basis without fearing for her life.  
  
Every once in a while, she'd hover around me about a foot away (I like to think she was saying ""Hi"") before heading back to her nest. The last day she was here before migrating south for the winter, she landed on my sliding screen door with her tiny feet gripping onto the screen as she started ""chirping"" at me (or whatever it is that they do). I was sitting on my couch in my apartment playing Xbox with my son at the time. She flew off about 10 seconds later and that was that.  
  
We're hoping she comes back again this May.  
  
**TL/DR:** I just might be a hummingbird whisperer. lol

**OP -** I believe the bird recognizes a friend and genuine human being. I don't know that I'd go as far as trying to touch it ... that beak would tear you up! Plus - it's a wild animal and it's better off if it stays wild.  
  
Good for you for being a caring person! I hope it stays around as your friend for a long time. We can all use some good karma!",2019-02-01 04:10:45

My family has had a beautiful hawk living in the pine trees outback for years. Yesterday my mom texted me that she investigated something in the yard that she thought was a stray cat. Unfortunately she discovered the hawk frozen to the ground. We all have such heavy hearts over it. Such a beautiful bird fell victim to the elements. RIP.

And then they would, according to the information, just start all over again and once they were gone they would, in the future, continue to return  to their old place. My balcony.

ep434t,"> we may not be “fish” in the colloquial sense, but we are sarcopterygiid (lobe finned) osteichthyes (bony fish) in the cladistic  sense.

You’re right, sorry. I should have made that clearer. 

It’s not incorrect to say that birds are dinosaurs. Like I said in another comment, I just think it’s a misnomer to do so colloquially even if it’s cladistically correct, because it doesn’t pay respect to the different morphology they possess and niche they inhabit, the fact that they’re arguably pretty significantly derived. Also, low-key, you’re really helping me with revision here, so thank you 😂.",2020-01-15 22:28:39

It was bad enough having to cancel a fully paid non refundable wedding and the additional bonus embarrassment of informing the 150 guests we had already invited but.... all that aside, it was an especially long, painful, and lonely road to get where I am today because she refused to allow me any amount of closure about the whole thing, she decided she was no longer required to engage in any form of conversation with me since our relationship was over and since she had decided to immediately jump into a serious relationship with a new guy, because she (self admittedly) is incapable of being alone with her own thoughts for longer than 5 seconds. This was after I had just gotten done supporting her emotionally, loving her unconditionally, and letting her live in my house for the last 6 years silly me. 10/19/19 was the planned date for the wedding and she  already moved in to the new guys house by the second week of November... I wish I was making this all up cause it sounds almost too insane to be true 🙃 the worst part was the whole six years I 110% fully believed beyond the shadow of a doubt that she was a person I could trust to never do what she did to me, but she totally was.

cta97x,"I am sorry to proof you that you are wrong. There is no scientific study that proof that volcanic emissions produce more than humans. Specifically Moerner and Etiope (2002) and Kerrick (2001) published a scientific overview of minimum and maximum CO2 Emission per year. And it shows that the CO2 Emission From fossile fuel ist about 100 Times and more bigger than the Maximum CO2 emission of the Vulcans. 

The “fact” that Vulcans CO2 Emission ist bigger than anything else is false.

esh3rn,"Each paintball park is different. I’ve worked at one for 7 years and we are known to be one of the better ones in California simply based on how nice the employees are (although it has started to dip slightly if I’m being honest). Most paintball parks cater to the amateur player and there will always be a “walk-on” group for people who show up by themselves or with a small group of friends. People think it hurts, and I’ll be the first one to tell you I’m the wrong person to ask because I get paid to take shots and not complain about it, but it honestly doesn’t hurt that bad. You very rarely, if ever, get shot in the nuts. You can wear gloves too, it’s perfectly reasonable to wear them, padded gloves get annoying after while (to me they do) so I bought some gorilla grip gloves from Home Depot (lightweight and gives you a thin layer over your hands). You’ll get shot and the one thing people do is anticipate the first hit and think how bad it will hurt, your adrenaline will be pumping and you won’t even notice the first time you get hit. I promise 😁. Go forth and prosper!!!",2020-01-23 06:20:44

How my horse reacts to a large puppy vs a small adult dog is very different (similar to the wildebeest- playful hopping rather than a more dominant or flight stance). But same true of many other species.

Wouldn't trust my sheep or goats with other babies (own species or same!) though. But that's because they are just arseholes that view every other 4-legged creature as a rival for food. 🤣",2023-04-26 07:08:25

Plus you are right by one of the largest volcanoes in the world. Between wildlife and magma chambers, yeah, seems odd to want to live there, but the heart wants what the heart wants. Quite a few millionaires and up live around there, some all year. I had much rather live with all of that than live in SC where I live now.

y4cw70,"People don’t understand how dangerous moose actually are. They are huge and I mean HUGE. We’re talking up to 1,600lbs standing at an average height of 6’ at the shoulder. While moose dont particularly target humans, they are not afraid of humans like deer. If provoked and/or the moose thinks you’re a danger to her calves they will ctrl + alt + del you faster than you’d know what to do with yourself. 
 
Also don’t plan on running away from them… they can run up to 35mph on land, and don’t try getting away in water either… Moose are excellent swimmers with a swimming top speed of up to 13mph or they can swim for over 2 hours at a speed of 6mph. Not to mention, they can dive up to 20 feet deep all while being able to remain submerged in water for up to 50 seconds. I would recommend avoiding moose 💀",2022-10-16 07:59:42

y4cw70,"I might be about to blow your mind. 🙃

Moose don't live in Arizona. What we have are elk, which look similar, but are about 4'9"" at the shoulder. Moose, on the other hand, can be up to 6'9"" at the shoulder.

A really huge bull elk can have a 4 foot tall rack, so a bull elk could conceivably be just about as tall as a moose... but only if you measure from the tips of the antlers to the ground. 

Moose are also much beefier than elk. They can weigh 1400 pounds while elk get up to 730 pounds.

We had one bull moose wander down from Utah or Colorado last year, so it's not like a moose being in AZ is an impossibility, but it was a loner. If we had a population in the Grand Canyon it would've made huge headlines. 

Soooooo yeah, while the animals you saw were huge (and also dangerous), moose are even freaking bigger!",2022-10-15 10:41:43

I was thinking that if I were to get a big enough lenses to shoot this the aperture would have to be closed enough to allow both objects to be in focus (at least enough) and to lower the brightness of the suns reflection off the surface of the moon so we could see past it. But since I have no idea about telescopes I’m not sure anymore. I could however pull this off in Final Cut Pro by putting a mask around the shot of the moon on a shot of Saturn and just create a little move. So initially when looking at this I had my suspicions. But looking at some of the comments there seems to be some folks that can explain it. 🤷‍♂️",2020-11-14 08:03:56

jed2vd,"Lol the worst thing you could do to someone who speaks English as a second language is provide them with misinformation. Or inaccurate corrections. I’ve dated many foreigners and whenever they asked a question about English to me, I’d *always* fact check it before even thinking about offering an answer. Because misteaching simple concepts and words can make it more confusing for them when they find out what they once knew as “right” is now “wrong”. Specially to someone who speaks a non-Latin based language. 

I knew for a fact that he was right, and the other commenters were feeding him misinformation-  I don’t know why.

Alls they had to do was google spine chilling.

So technically the OP who used spine chilling knows more about English as a second language than the ppl that speak English as a primary language 😭 💀",2020-10-20 16:54:42

Potato in a jacket,
Toys in the attic,

My brain is scrambled,
Rap like an animal but I'm a mammal

Vivosectified and fed pesticides,
My face is all cut up
My radar's all shut up
Nurse I need a check-up from the neck up,
I'm Batty!

They used and abused me,
Battered and bruised me,
Red wires green wires stuck em' right through me,
So hear my Batty word,
And exercise a little prudence,

So fun fact, two of the main reasons we can’t stay in the womb for extra time to “cook” longer are 1) the vernix layer (a cheesy-like protective substance on babies skin in the womb) will start to deteriorate and the babies skin would start to deteriorate as a result and 2) the nutrient supply from the umbilical cord wouldn’t be enough to maintain growth, because as the baby gets bigger it needs more and more.

I respect parents because they do something that I know i just don’t have the patience for. I know I’d be shit at it. I don’t have patience for my parrot sometimes, far less an actual child. I like my sleep 😂

You are endangering this baby's life by touching it...and as a wildlife photographer, you should know better. I wonder how far have you walked actually? The baby is getting separated from its mother? Please let us know if the baby got reunited back with its mother or now lost in tbe jungle as you walk back to your residence...very concerned and feel bad for the baby tapir. 😔😒😠",2020-05-13 05:17:14

Further, the screen shows only the clip with a square edge, surely the recovered ""cat vision"" should be the whole environment inc. the screen and anything in the foreground and background. 

The device they have strapped to the cats head looks like a [fNIRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_near-infrared_spectroscopy) device and I have never come across any suggestions that those devices can allow brain data to be recorded and parsed. In fact, fNIRS is too low res to show you cell activity and instead can only show regional changes in blood oxidation.

gqjbgz,"Unfortunately I have to drive a Van as I’m a Gas Engineer, although I only drive when absolutely necessary and Van share where possible.

I stay away from Palm Oil and many other food products.

The definition of Veganism “Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.”

I know where you’re going with this, I hear this argument constantly you all really need new material. By a farmers account (no actual scientific evidence mind you) around 3Billion animals and insects are killed each year with crop deaths. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that’s true, 85% of farmland in the world is used for animal agriculture, humans use a mere 15%. So we can agree that 85% of 3 Billion is around 2.55billion.

So going by that, people who consume plants (including meat eaters) are responsible, are directly responsible for around 450,000,000 deaths a year. I around 3% of the population of the world is Vegan (people who eat only plants) that means Vegans are responsible for around 13.5million deaths.

From that we can assume

Vegans = 13.5million deaths

Non Vegans = 2,986,500,000 deaths 

Add that to the estimated 72 Billion land animals killed and 1.5trillion fished killed purely for food. 

I’d say Veganism pales in comparison wouldn’t you?

Wake the fuck up man, your defending an industry that’s destroying our planet.

My point is, it’s almost impossible to get rid of the things you said in today’s society, one of the easiest and most effective things you can do in regards to animal welfare, the planet and human welfare is to go Vegan 🌱✌️🙏",2020-05-27 08:42:17

o2dyj5,Just caught my first ever firefly last night 💡 💜 😊,2021-06-18 04:14:25
o2dyj5,"Amazing! I saw fireflies in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, in the 70’s. It was just like a spiritual moment as John Denver was on my transistor radio singing Rocky Mountain High. I haven’t seen one since but what a great moment that was. Thanks for sharing 😊",2021-06-18 04:16:04
o2dyj5,"The light is coming from a protein named firefly luciferase, or 'luciferase'. (Lucifer means light bringer). It is an immensely important tool in molecular biology because we can transform cells with its mRNA, add a substrate, and watch the cells light up. It's a good way to assess how efficient a transformation method is...how well does one's tool help DNA or RNA get into cells so it can be expressed? I think this was partly used in the development of a lipid used in our new mRNA vaccines. We can also do other trippy things like fuse its coding sequence (an mRNA) to that of a fluorescent protein's - so then, this light producing thing excites its other half causing a specific color light to be emitted from (there are FPs for many colors...red, green, yellow, cyan, etc. 

It's crazy to imagine what amazingly helpful tools can come about from analyzing sequences and biochemistry from nature. Sorry I'm high right now so just wanted to tell a science story 🤷",2021-06-18 05:07:28

Right now it's probably out there inventing a rudimentary sling weapon and nobody will stop it because they'd get stuck arguing over whether the crow is learning about centrifugal or centripetal force.

>	It’s likely that Tahlequah will once again lose her calf, given the history. She lost another calf before the baby she gave birth to two years ago, which survived only one half-hour. She carried the more than 300-pound, 6-foot-long calf day after day, refusing to let it go.

Edit: People are mentioning fish farms which is valid. But tell me, are the fish sold at supermarkets from fish farms? Are the fish at markets in towns/villages from a fish farm? Most of them will be from commercial fishing. If your argument is that fish farming exists and is a better alternative, then buy your fish from a fish farm.

wjysko,"*them damn city slickers an their appalling views on what I do on my Fun Happy Farm™️ down home. You ain’t even never tugged on a cows udders, how you gonna say those things about whut we do?*

In 5th grade where I grew up in Georgia I remember the local dairy farm brought a sort of fun exhibit for kids at the school to interact with farm animals and drink milk. When they brought us out, they had 5 cows out lined up. Two were hooked up to milking machines and they were demonstrating the process. The other three had holes in their sides. Holes big enough I could stick my head through. They had the kids line up one by one and stick their hand in and mix around the shit in the cow’s stomach. I looked these creatures in the eyes and saw an entire species that has been forcibly enslaved, bred, and slaughtered for thousands and thousands of generations. Perhaps at one point out of necessity. But now? Tradition, and they taste good. Sorry to bum you out with my “inane vegan bullshit” but it’s not right, and I can’t live with myself if I don’t speak up.",2022-08-09 12:49:44

pbklg5,"yes, exactly. Arthropods all have jointed 'legs' (limbs), that's where the name comes from. They have an exoskeleton and segmented bodies. They start with 6 legs (Hexapoda) aka insects, 8 legs (Arachnids 'spiderlike') aka spiders, scorpions, harvestermen, mites etc. Then come the myrapods ('many legs') like -you guessed it- centipedes and millipedes; finally there are crustaceans ('crablikes') with crabs, lobster, shrimp and pillbugs.

There are some odd fellows in this such a the horseshoe crab or the barnacles but in the majority it just comes down to the number of legs 😀",2021-08-26 06:50:52

ht2k4f,Plato would have reconsidered if Australia were known to him. 🦘,2020-07-17 23:10:51
ht2k4f,"They require large amounts of ants every day. So they're very difficult to keep in captivity and breed. There is a conservation center in southeast Asia, however, which found an incredibly ingenious means to feed them. Apparently, frozen ant larva are quite a popular snack in that part of the world, and it makes for an extremely easily obtainable and cheap food source for the asain pangolins kept in the sanctuary where they're rehabbed after being confiscated from poachers or found injured by things like snare traps (which destroy their poor little hind legs 😢). 

Unfortunately, this food source isn't really available to conservationists in Africa trying to save the pangolins native to the continent, so rescues/sanctuaries that raise/rescue/rehab pangolins trafficked by poachers which were injured or became malnourished from not being able to forage have to literally follow the pangolins around and act as a sort of guard and then take them back to the compound after they've eaten, which makes saving these poor animals very resources intensive and difficult.

If we could just effectively counterfeit millions of pangolin scales, we might be able to reduce the black market price for pangolin scales to the point where poaching them becomes ceases to be worth it. These counterfeit scales could even be distributed to some of these impoverished poachers, so that they can still get some sort of income while hoodwinking those Chinese dicks who continue to promote the trade of these endangered animals (I'm not saying all Chinese are evil endangered species profiteers, cause plenty are activists trying to save the pangolin).",2020-07-18 03:16:37

udohac,"I was hiking the Wonderland Trail around Mt. Rainier several years ago and my hiking partner and I started hearing these chuffing sounds from somewhere near us and so we started singing and making a bunch of racket on the assumption it was a bear..... turns out it was just the third member of our group who had fallen behind and was making a loud huffing chuffing noise as he walked just to keep himself amused. I'm sure the two of us singing and clapping and making all sorts of racket to deter ""the bear""  were also quite amusing. 🤦",2022-04-28 14:54:49

udohac,"Actually here in Alaska,it's backwards than in the lower 48. The black bears are  VERY aggressive. The wildlife troopers even tell us not to bother with bear spray and go right for a firearm with black bears as they've killed people over the last few years. In the lower 48, they're like large dogs... not here. Their resources are becoming too limited. The brown bears (grizzlies) while being much bigger seem to give humans a much wider berth and avoid us by our scent, our sounds, and bear spray still works. They still basically think we're not worth the trouble. It's gotten to be that state biologists are concerned that black bears up here have been impacted by a neurological problem that inhibits their fear of us... it's wild. (No pun intended). But all Alaskans are still way more afraid of Moose. They're the really scary OGs 😉",2022-04-29 05:31:16
udohac,"Well you’ll die too bc it’s a brown bear not a chihuahua. There plenty of videos of tiny black bears getting hit full speed by cars and they walk it off like it was nothing. That’s just black bears, much smaller than a brown bear. You think you’re stronger than a moving car 🤣? Brown bears have 5 inch claws. You’re fighting an animal that has built in knives for nails, teeth that can easily break any bone in your body, over 1000 lbs of muscle, can measure up to 9ft tall standing, can move up to 35mph and you think you and your buddies can take it down 🤣. I think you read too many stories and overestimate how strong humans are compared to a brown bear. I can find stories of ppl surviving plane crashes, doesn’t mean that most people will survive a plane crash if they had to go thru one just bc there are stories of survivors",2022-04-29 19:00:23

And the lobbies of the weapon producers and the like have amassed so much power that they basically control the country now.

nqjbjn,"How much can you really do to a gorilla? Also, if you’re gonna venture out on a boat to a place where you’re bound to see gorillas, you should know better. I want to think those are good people and he just acted our of fear. Because you honestly have to be a complete idiot to taunt a gorilla who is just minding his own business. I mean, the mofo looks intimidating even in emojis 🦍 

I think a really strong person; be it a guy from one of those “strongest men in the world” competitions—- or just a ripped dude who can bench and dead lift crazy weights—- can at least try to out strength a gorilla by subduing his arms but I don’t think that can happen. A gorilla has immense power and strength. Even in the hypothetical scenario that a man could do this, gorilla will still rip your face off with his mouth. A human simply can’t win a battle.

They take it back and leave it in the closest spot to where it was found (the law dudes). I guess it happens quite frequently so you can never say it enough, apparently.
On a different note, we live in a small, semi-woodsy housing area. We had a deer literally leave her young uns sitting under a neighbor's tree on their front lawn basically unshielded from anything. Pretty bold! But I was thankful I'd heard about leaving them be. Cos I would be one of those ""kind hearted animal lovers."" 🤦🏻‍♀️",2020-07-07 15:02:38

kinda the same thing but not. the dawn wall is a part of this the southeast face of El Capitan and is apparently the hardest to climb. 

i think the main difference is that in the dawn wall they climb it over a few days, whereas in free solo Alex climbs the whole thing in one go.",2020-07-30 14:55:19

vf5bmu,"This seems to be filtered strangely because when you shine a light on the gators at night, their eyes glow RED. Like cats, an alligator has a tapetum lucidum at the back of each eye – a structure that reflects light back into the photoreceptor cells to make the most of low light. I believe cat eyes can reflect as yellow, orange, green, blue, red, or even multicolored.

I promise you that hundreds of red eyes is far spookier than this photo appears! 🤣 Especially when you hear all the swamp sounds around you.

Cold fried chicken, tater salad  (mustard tater salad is the best), sandwiches and more. Then, you pigged out on watermelon and spit seeds at each other. Big melons, too. Not the little basketball sized ones. Had to be careful the ""Bear"" didn't get you, though. Good memories.😊

No predators in that case, but a concern still as these seals had no fear of humans and also extra curious of dogs which can turn fatal very easily.... locals said they are very friendly due to stupid people feeding them and now they have become dependent on it ☹️[here is a little guy following my board anyways ](https://photos.app.goo.gl/hxFZk2SxMbSS86Lr8)",2021-05-15 11:42:55

hptm3x,"I will never forget the first time I saw fireflies it was so magical and I hope you indulge me and let me tell you the story.  I am from the UK,  we don't have fireflies.

Any opportunity I get I try to visit New York and from there travel across country to see my best friend and her family in Toledo Ohio.

My first time in another part of the country and we went for ice cream at about 10pm, it was still light but starting to get dark. I saw a flash of green like a mini camera flash going off and said what's that.  My friends were shocked I'd never seen one before. 

We went back to my friends' family's place and got some jars to see if we could catch one so I could see up close and it was really sweet.  Went back inside to play video games and when we were leaving to head back to my friends we walked out to see a beautiful deer eating from the fruit tree in their front yard, whilst fireflies danced around it.  It was straight out of a Disney movie and that's when I knew nature is the most wonderful part of life.  

🔥 Nature is TRULY lit 🔥",2020-07-12 16:05:51

z04x03,"If you’re staying at a hotel like The Westin, St.Regis or The Ritz Carlton for example, you should be good! (Hadn’t a single encounter with a scary creature in the hotel, though I did encounter some odd looking beings when I was out and about) however we had a lapse of judgment while booking hotel rooms and we were genuinely taken aback by the hotel we first arrived at (Rebak Island Resort & Marina) it was simply a nightmare! While the region itself was just as beautiful as you’d expect it to be, there were bats flying in and out of our rooms every time we opened our doors, insects *everywhere* (I was shocked by the diversity too, like wow I only see moths and cockroaches in my country), lizards, but there were also pretty butterflies, birds and snails too. 

Unfortunately because you don’t really have to pay much to stay there, the rooms weren’t maintained properly- there were jumping bugs in the toilet, the bedsheets were stained red and brown and there was hair stuck to the pillowcase, there was some sort of green mould all over the walls (you could smell the mould in the air, I couldn’t sleep at night because of how tight my chest was 😬) We asked for the bedsheets to be replaced and the room service staff placed the ‘new’ bedsheets on a brown, muddy baby crib that had tiny insects crawling all over before fixing them on the mattress 💀. 

We acknowledged that we were simply expecting too great quality and sophistication from a place that’s virtually cut off from the rest of the island. We ended up booking rooms in The Westin for the rest of the stay, and it was an absolute delight! The views there are simply unrivalled.",2022-11-20 18:25:41

unjh0q,"Turtles, like snakes, lizards, etc are cold-blooded. So they sit out in the sun to get warm. They cannot generate their own heat. We lucky warm-blooded humans are around 98.6 degrees F whether it’s 110 degrees out or 50. 

So the turtle would be more cold if it fell in the water. But I wouldn’t worry, they fall in all the time anyway 😆 (source: have watched many turtles on slippery logs trying to move around) 

I’m not a turtle though so I can’t speak to how cold it feels to fall in or anything, or how long it takes to get warm again. I don’t know the temp of the water (possibly relatively warm, since the water is still, and it’s near enough to the shore to have a giant log and be filmed by a person —> implies the water is shallow), what the temp of the air is, how much wind there is (looks like none based on the lack of ripples), etc. I’m also not a turtle expert and idk what temperature for what amount of time would cause a turtle to actually die. 

Tl;dr turtles need sun to stay warm, but falling in wouldn’t kill it at all",2022-05-12 06:08:51

jf4572,"It really is. I’ve been twice with my brother. Did a road trip in the south and a road trip through the Lofoten islands in the north. Absolutely unfucking believable. 

Pre Covid days you could hop on a cheap flight, rent a car and just go exploring. Maybe in a year or two you’ll be able to do it again. 

Oh and they speak the most amazing English - better than me! And it’s California English, probably due to tv shows and movies. It’s actually slightly frustrating because you will not learn one Norwegian word. Well, maybe one, “Tak” for “thanks”. At least I think it’s tak. Everyone is super friendly but not nosey - the perfect combination. 

In the north you’ll see the Northern Light. O. M. G. It’s not like what you see in pictures. It’s better believe it or not. The light “dances”. It’s alive. Most bizarre thing I’ve ever seen. If I lived back in olden times I would think they were spirits. 

As for the cost of food. It’s only expensive if you eat out. Stay at a place that has a kitchen and cook your own food. Food is not expensive at the grocery store. And they have a candy similar to Swedish fish but it’s monkeys instead - delicious. 

I just can’t say enough good things about Norway. Just absolutely stunning. 

As for moving there. I have no clue. But once we get through Covid I highly recommend visiting. You will not regret it. And even if you don’t move there, at least on your deathbed you will be able to say, “At least I visited Norway.”  🇳🇴",2020-10-21 05:40:16

jf4572,"It really 💯 is. I’ve been twice 💥😵 with my brother 👬. Did a road 🛣 trip ✈ in the south 👇🆘 and a road 🛣🚗🚘 trip 🏖🏕🏜 through the Lofoten islands 🏝 in the north ⬆😜📍. Absolutely 🙀 unfucking ❌😤 believable 🙏🙌.   
  
Pre ◀ Covid 👑 days 📆 you 👈 could hop 🐇 on 🔛 a cheap 💸 flight ✈, rent 💵🎶 a car 🚗 and just go 🏃 exploring 🚁🛩. Maybe 🤔 in a year 📅 or two ✌✔ you’ll be able 💪 to do it again ❌😬.   
  
Oh 🙀 and they speak 🗣 the most amazing ❤🧡💛 English 🤐 - better 👍 than me! And it’s California 👙🇩🇪 English 🇬🇧, probably 😻😱 due 🙏 to tv 📺 shows 📺 and movies 🎥. It’s actually 😳 slightly ▪😰 frustrating 😤 because you 👈 will not learn 👨‍🏫 one 1️⃣ Norwegian 🇳🇴 word 📓. Well 😦, maybe 🤷‍♀️ one 1️⃣, “Tak” for “thanks”. At least 💯 I 👁 think 🤔 it’s tak 💰. Everyone 👥 is super 😺 friendly 👫 but 🍑 not nosey 👃 - the perfect 💯 combination 🔗.   
  
In the north 👆 you’ll see 👀👉 the Northern 🎅 Light 💡. O. M. G 🅾🇳. It’s not like 👍🏻 what you 👉 see 👀 in pictures 📸. It’s better 👍 believe 🙏 it or not. The light 💡 “dances”. It’s alive 😇. Most bizarre 🧽 thing 📴 I’ve ever 😠 seen 👀. If I 👁 lived 🏠 back 🔙 in olden 👴 times ⏰ I 👁 would think 🤔 they were spirits 👻.   
  
As for the cost 💰💸 of food 🐟. It’s only expensive 💸 if you 👉🚫 eat 👄👅 out. Stay 💒 at a place 🏆 that has a kitchen 🐶 and cook 🍳 your 👉 own food 🐟🍜. Food 😩 is not expensive 💵 at the grocery 🍅🍏🍐 store 🏪. And they have a candy 🍭 similar 👱 to Swedish 🇨🇭 fish 🐟 but 🍑 it’s monkeys 🐒🙊 instead 🚔 - delicious 😋.   
  
I 🕵👁 just can’t say 💬 enough 💦👷 good 👌 things 📴 about 🤔💭 Norway 🇳🇴. Just absolutely 🙀 stunning 😫✨.   
  
As for moving 📦 there. I 👁😫 have no 🚫👎 clue 🗝. But 🍑 once we get 🉐 through Covid 😷😻 I 👁 highly 🕛 recommend 💡 visiting 🚗➡. You 👉 will not regret 😔 it. And even 🌃 if you 👈 don’t move 📦 there, at least ❗ on 🔛 your 👉 deathbed you 👉 will be able 👉 to say 💬, “At least 💯 I 👁 visited 🔛↙ Norway.” 🇳🇴",2020-10-21 06:13:36
jf4572,"As a Dane 🐶🐎👣 who recently 🕛 moved 📦 to Norway 🗡🛡👨🏼 - it’s almost 💦 certainly 😎 the most well-functioning society 👥 in the world 🌎 too. Norway 🇳🇴💃🏼 is a wonderland ☺😍😉 and life 👤 on 🔛 easy 👅 mode 🚨 and the only reason 🌱🌈🌟 Norwegians wouldn’t believe 🌈 so, is if they haven’t tried 👀 anything 😯 else 😩.   
  
The amazing ❤🧡💛 English 🇬🇧 is probably 😻 more due 🙈 to a great 😁👍 educational 👨‍🎓⁉🆗 system ☄ than tv 📺 shows 🎫📺 and movies 🎬 though 🤔.",2020-10-21 06:37:18
jf4572,"Also, you guys have bus drivers with next level skills. Drove to Troll’s Pass and then down the other side... these bus drivers were navigating corners and roads with amazingly tight margins. I was driving a bmw 3-series thinking it was tight then I see there’s a huge bus in front of me thinking how tf did he drive that thing up here?! If there was bus driver olympics (which I would watch btw) you guys would win hands down 😎",2020-10-21 12:50:27

fhm1c4,"My mom and aunt both had skunks when they were in their 20’s. Sister skunks actually, ZhaZha & Zhee Zhee. Their scent glands get removed when younger so they don’t spray. And they can use a litter box like cats. My mom’s was super feisty and my aunt’s was just cuddly, fat and lazy. They both lived about 10 yrs. But they’re illegal as pets here in Chicago or anywhere in Illinois for that matter. Which sucks because I would’ve loved to have one. My dad had one too when he was in high school. And no, I have no idea why they all had them considering my entire family grew up on the south side of Chicago. 🤷🏻‍♀️ just a bunch of animal lovers I guess!
*i can find a photo if anyone requests[my dad Joe & his pet skunk ‘66](https://imgur.com/gallery/SrUWYdt)


EDIT: *** And no- I would not do that to one just so I could have it as a pet. I’m a huge animal lover and advocate for adoption always. We have 4 pets of our own, all rescues. Times were different then, I know they probably thought they were just giving them homes. They didn’t buy them from a pet shop, it was a family friend who had the sister skunks out in Indiana. My mom & aunt thought they were “rescuing” theirs. As for my dad’s skunk, I’m not sure where she came from. My dad just passed away a few months ago and I never got to ask. I just found the picture when going through some of his things. This post popped up, It made me smile, and just wanted to share.",2020-03-12 23:18:38

fhm1c4,"There's so many issues that on their own seem simple & wouldn't be much of a concern, but put them all together and it becomes problematic because one issue ties into another. 

Also, it's been 10 years since we've seen a real hourly raise despite what the media claims. We lose that fight every negotiation 🤷‍♂️",2020-03-12 23:46:08

Of course it's fucking alive, we just don't give a shit about it until it's born. Unless we do give a shit about it. That's what decides the value of an unborn baby, if the mother and father want it or not. Oh that upsets you? Good. I'm also heavily in favor of third trimester abortion. Gets me hard knowing that all those lives aren't going to be ruined. And that some random pro-birthers that don't give a shit about anything except the baby being born are going to cry about it.

Most of you also hate government assistance. 🙄",2021-10-21 21:14:23

 Anti abortionists should be vegan if they wanna be morally consistent at all.

My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭

In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as ""R/Wooooosh"" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile.

g63ilz,"The MegaTurt rose from the waves of the atlantic, blocking the light and all hope of survival with it. 

""Aye lads! Stick to your stations!"" Captain yelled, men scurried around in a dance of chaos and fear. Some were seen diving to the water, knowing that we were done for.

""CANONS!"" The captain bellowed. ""ON MY COMAND!""

The MegaTurt rose ever higher, its leather like scales almost large as the ship, and itsfierce beak like mouth was heard snapping in the air. Almost as if the sound would be enough to threaten our sea-hardy captain.

""FIRE!"" His voice vibrated amungst the ship as a wave of canon balls threw themselves towards the beast, tipping our ship to the side. 

The captain gave the monster no rest.
""FIRE!"" Another of his screams ran across under deck, as more weapons were cast into the sea. 

Themonster slowly retreated, small circles if lead embedded into its mighty armor. Down into the water it swam, never to be seen by this wooden boat of men again.🏴‍☠️",2020-04-23 01:57:33

That reminds me if a time where I saw a tourist family from Japan. Their daughter thought it would be a good idea to play Hopscotch on the sea turtles trying to sleep on the beach. The parents didnt do anything and were petting other turtles. There was even a sign in Japanese that said you couldnt touch them, or you'll be given a huge fine.

Police saw it and took the dad away because he wouldnt listen.",2020-04-22 21:15:38

s4yiki,"Mute swans(Cygnus olor) is usually more used to people and seek them out as they often has been fed by humans before and has a history of being kept as ""pets"" unlike other species that has been hunted for generations :) I'm not so familiar with the Trumpeter swan(C buccinator), but most other swan species is more sceptical towards us. Not always, but often:) Thanks a lot for the award good sir 🥳",2022-01-16 23:33:48

Nope, nope, and nope.

Had a friend who worked deep freeze oil. Long story short. **Rule #1: Polar bear area. Don’t go outside alone. Period.** Guy goes out to pee or whatever, and doesn’t come back. Few days later they find him. Well, not him, frozen blood mostly a pale pink, all around. Already mostly covered by snow and blown wind wiping away the area. Don’t mess around in the polar bear area.

pkkc4c,"Someday when we invent time travel, we need some kind of reality tv where we ""invite"" (rather kidnap) someone from the past (i dunno like duplicate them at that point in the past and ship the variant to the future) and they get paired with a random person who will be their ""guide"" to the modern world. The format will be like any reality tv and we get those interviews in between of the historical ""guest"". It's probably really cruel to rip the duplicate/variant from their time period but it's the only way to not deal with inconsistencies in the timeline. Part of the episode will just show them going around doing mundane things like going to the grocery store, visiting time square etc, swiping on tinder on their smartphones, etc. 

And the season finale will be all of the ""guests"" present in the studio where the host will ask them juicy questions about their life. For example we will have the version of the tv show where in one season we can have war-crazed historical figures like Genghis Khan, maybe Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, and in the end they'll trash talk each other and somebody gets pissed off and they all get into a fight but it will only look ridiculous because we wont give them access to weapons and there'll be bouncers/security who are ready to tase them should they try anything stupid. There will be some comback season where they are sent to some rehab facility and they get sent to do mundane jobs as part of the rehab. Im going on and on but I've had this idea for a while! 🤣

You just don’t get it. It’s just another rich guy swindling the public (for upvotes instead of for money.) paragliding is a “people with money” hobby. You don’t see broke people paragliding with pet vultures, do you? He thinks he’s clever, posting with a misleading title because nowhere in the title or comments does he specify it is *not* wild, therefore posting with intent to trick the untrained eye into believing it’s real.

11icmcd,"Sorry I didn't mean to be condescending. It's more a personal annoyance with ""the system"" than what you said. 

It's always best to call whoever the right local authorities are, but they're notorious for telling people they are essentially crazy and or didn't see what they know they saw. Mountain Lions being the most common culprit. 

I've studied them in the Houston area with multiple accounts from qualified outdoorsman who have seen them all over the Houston area... the most notable account being a cat walking down the middle of NASA Road 1 and some of the reports of a Chocolate colored cat in the Sugar Land area of Fort Bend County during the early 90s when the area was being developed. They're everywhere I've looked basically, but somebody calls to report a mountain lion hanging out on their pool furniture at night they get told ""they're seeing things"" even when there's clearly foreign animal hair 😑 

It doesn't take long before you realize that the standard issue answer from local officials in Texas is ""you saw nothing"" which I can only explain as a weird ass backwards preservation attempt due to the fact that the cats are harmless and nearly impossible to track down in real time. 

To say I'm jaded at this point is an understatement 😆

I've even taken pictures of a fresh 5.5in mountain lion footprint after a storm directly in front of the A&M small animal hospital on campus... and even the vet I was there to see gave me the weirdest look. The entirety of knowledge of our native cats is piss poor at best, and the more you look into it the more apparent it becomes.",2023-03-05 03:02:39

8dw7he,"If you want to learn more about poaching and places where poaching is almost condonable (but not quite), read a book called 🔥 “**[The Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129551459) **.” 🔥 It’s about the far far north east of Russia, where everyone is destitute and the only way to make money is by poaching.

Horrible, right?  I agree.  But the book is worth a read.

Picture a poacher who hunts down an Amur (Siberian) Tiger, out of desperation.  He wounds the Tiger, but makes the mistake of taking the Tiger’s kill.  

The Tiger does not let that go.  She turns and hunts him.  Bits are found everywhere.  People congregate in Maltov’s (he poacher) cabin, but the Tiger circles it, occasionally nodding off, but behaving like a *person* and crouching, all 500lbs or so and 8-9 feet of fatty Tiger.  It leaps 12 feet. The Tiger, like a human, wants *revenge*.

*Inspector Tiger* is a group that protects tigers, but also protects people.  And this Tiger is behaving like a person, so what do they do?  

It’s a great read, I tell you.  You learn a lot about morals and poaching on the poorest parts of Russia.  And why Russia is so poor in that area.",2018-04-21 16:25:03

But at the same time we like to get obese and get pills and health care to survive and treatments and let our ill babies make it - even though the unborn future generations will have the downsides of it. They would wish we would have a hard selection process and they can harvest the benefits of it for free.

ujagak,"Fireflies on summer nights were the soft neon magic of my childhood. I grew up in a concrete city far from nature, but on summers I still had fireflies and ladybugs and dandelion puffs and silvery slug trails... I’m heartbroken they’ve disappeared now 😔",2022-05-06 02:11:23
ujagak,"I’m 55 almost 56. 

I grew up predominantly in upstate ny.   We had tons of fire flies. 

I mean everywhere.    We’d catch them and put them in mason jars, to watch them light up for a couple minutes, then let them free 

What a great memory 

Thanks 😊",2022-05-06 02:23:35
ujagak,Every year I try to catch (and release) the first lightning bug I see. This year my dog beat me to it and ate the poor firefly. 😬,2022-05-06 02:24:02
ujagak,In the 90's southern Louisiana fireflies used to be in abundance... Now its a rarity. Can't say the same about those pesky mosquitoes and love bugs. I've probably got 3 dozen or so on my front bumper now lol🤨,2022-05-06 03:43:31

ujagak,"Fun fact: I was a dumb kid and loved whatever few cents I could scrounge up for a limber/limbel. Neighborhood kid dared me to eat a lightning bug for a quarter. 

I was convinced the little light in his butt could be poisonous to me somehow. I had a dilemma to face. A delicious frozen snack or possibly dying/going to the hospital… 

I got a cherry limber 😇

Side note: I was legit like 11-12. Would never intentionally hurt or kill a lightning bug nowadays. I love them!",2022-05-06 04:43:02

ujagak,And I swear their populations are decreasing in my town. The only thing I have ever loved about Summer was watching the fireflies. I always thot they were fairies when I was little. I haven’t seen any in the past 4years & it makes me sad. I wanted to be able to tell my granddaughters about the fairies & let them see. WTH?! Frikkin global warming & whatnot! 🥺😭😭,2022-05-06 20:31:28

ujagak,"It works a lot like a glow stick. When you crack a glow stick you’re combining the two chemicals and creating the glow. Luciferin and luciferase (lucifer was the light bringer… etymology is fun) bind together with an oxygen molecule. This process is the same regardless of whether the bioluminescent organism is land dwelling, or sea dwelling! I do bioluminescent kayak tours, phytoplankton and jellies in the water in Florida and it’s cool seeing that and fireflies at the same time in the same place 🥲",2022-05-06 04:30:42

e7b94j,"As an artist, I searched the internet thinking some other artist had probably created an illustration of this, but I couldn’t find it. I see it SO clearly in my head — but I’m unmotivated. 😆 

The scene starts with a shot of the back of the room, but you can’t see the ground. It’s like a cozy winter evening, bear is in his nice riveted leather chair (only shown from the back), sitting in front of the fireplace. The room is lit with a yellow orange glow flickering off the decor, shadows creating a nice depth to the scene. To the right of the chair is a wall of pictures and paintings in ornate frames atop a forest green floral wallpaper. There’s a little antique smoking table to the left, you see bear tap out his pipe and as he’s reloading it, the camera pans around the left and now you see the fireplace on the left, bear in that 2/3 space with the wall behind him (with the fire glow flickering on the frames on the wall) next to the smirking table and 3/3 is a blur of old dark cherry furniture (desk, bookshelf, the works). Bear is looking through the bottom of his glasses, refilling the pipe, open book upside down on his crossed legs, he’s in his silk robe, he takes a puff and then picks up his book to start reading again. The camera zooms out more along the fireplace wall and there it is... the human skin rug. As the narrator says: Only the finest rug for the finest gentleman. At that point, you see bear looking over his book directly into the camera. Then, the big bold ornate words come up on the screen: Humana Rugs. Screen goes dark.",2019-12-07 15:22:08

dwij08,"Ok, I've had a decent amount of family members die.

When they are at the funeral parlor all that junk (insides) has been removed and they are filled and coated with taxidermy stuff, right? 

Are they stuffed with cotton balls or fiberglass insulation? Are they dipped or painted or coated with formaldehyde? Why does all dead people at funerals look like they were drenched in easy breezy beautiful COVERGIRL®.

But seriously, my mom died she wasnt found for a while, her open casket funeral everyone (female family members) was upset because she didnt look like herself it looks like the funeral director was dealing with silly putty/stretch armstrong syndrome (medical term i made up) cause she was so decomposed PLUS he didnt know what she looked like cause no one gave him a picture, he was just winging it I suppose. Thats a huge handicap now that I think of it, like ""I want my portrait painted but you cant see what I look like!"", heres a bag of decomposing goo you figure it out!

Also I'm curious after all this, how long cant a body last after it was properly fumigated? by a funeral home and buried in a casket...we went with ashes for my mom but my dad and his entire family is all buried in one plot along with the dog (illegal, I know) but one of my uncles snuck into the cemetary after his dad (my granpda died) and buried grandpas dog years later after it died with his father. If I were to dig them up right now how much were be left of them and is it feasibly to get them refurbished by a ""professional"" taxidermist.

Also, if a ""pro"" is reading this, how much for 1 dog, 4 adult men, 2 women and also can I get a rain check for future relatives?

TL;DR, go ashes people, so much more convenient and cheaper in the long run, most cemetarys has yearly fees and upkeep, cost ect. Save yourself the hassle and just burn everything that dies.",2019-11-15 12:07:47

d4e2hd,"Only a decade off, I was close eh? ;)    
But oh dude yeah, all jokes aside that is absolutely the  truth. I was just teasing you haha sorry if I came off as rude or anything. But yeah really though, a good majority the physical realities of the whole experience are definitely far from beautiful for many if not most people lol, myself included. My own experience with the one pregnancy involved I've had so far was riddled with insomnia at least three times worse than mine is normally, severe back stress, and NIGHTMARISHLY painful kidney stones, among other things. But wait, there's more! My labor/birth went like this: I was induced a week early because I was in near constant pain due to an unrelated issue and I needed to be operated on urgently, which they couldn't safely do until my son was out. Queue 36 or so hours of contractions with very little progress dilation wise. Then, out of nowhere, as if this whole experience was being scripted by some sadistic soap opera director, my son's heart rate started repeatedly plummeting down to *borderline* deadly numbers, which was my own personal worst nightmare. As soon as the first drop my bed was surrounded by a group of nurses and techs. Flashing lights going off over the birthing suite door. Absolute chaos and terror. I remember the reality taking a moment to sink in as they all rushed in, like oh my god, this is really bad isn't it. This is really fucking bad. Bless the hearts of the nurses who were talking to me softly between shouting orders between eachother and explaining every little thing that was happening as it happened. There was even one nurse whose position was literally just sitting kneeling by my head and holding my hand and reminding to keep breathing the oxygen. They were trying to reposition me in different ways hoping to fix the position he was in/pressure he was under but it wasn't that simple unfortunately. Emergency C-section swiftly followed the fourth heartrate drop. Four times in like 20 minutes. They were all so steady and stone faced up until this one moment that will never stop hearing in my mind, when the main doctor who'd been overseeing my labor from the start dropped what she was doing and shouted ""That's enough, he's coming out! I'm NOT watching this baby's heart rate drop again, get her prepped for surgery IMMEDIATELY!"" Like, the heartrate drops were enough to terrify me in a way that I wouldn't wish on anyone, but seeing the grim look on the doctor's face as she made the call for emergency surgery was a entirely new level of horror for me. It turns out the cord was wrapped around his chest so securely that it was keeping him from moving down my birth canal and it became so tight that everytime I had a contraction, the pressure would pull it tight enough so that his blood flow was being cut off on a life threatening level, hence the heartrate plummeting up and down with each one. Honestly one of my worst fears now is feeling again the kind of utter doom and terror I felt during that. Far from magical lmao. HE was magical of course, and as soon as he was safely out and with us it was the most magical moment of my life, but the physical experience pretty much the entire way from conception to C-section was far more miserable than magical in my case. So yeah, my whole sentiment here is that I completely get it. A lot of the experience is extremely jarring and exhausting, and more often than not fucking terrifying at at least one point or another. There's nothing remotely wrong with coming to the conclusion that you just personally do not want to experience it one way or another. Especially considering the fact that you can never know exactly how it could all go. Adoption is a truly beautiful and precious option to consider, I definitely hope you do go for it when and if the stars align for it :) there are so many little ones of all ages waiting for people like you. But oof anyways I didn't at all expect to go on for so long sorry. I'll have mercy on us all and stop rambling now lmao. ^Thanks ^for ^coming ^to ^my ^Ted ^Talk 😂    

Edit: sorry for... talking about my experiences and relating? I guess?",2019-09-15 11:51:26

eos9lf,"Teddy Roosevelt was involved in the transplation of 4 herds of bison.  Three herds went to Alaska and another went into Canada near Watson Lake.  All are thriving, so they can live in the northern environments.

Correction:   [http://www.explorenorth.com/library/yafeatures/bl-bison.htm](http://www.explorenorth.com/library/yafeatures/bl-bison.htm) 

In 1928, a group of Fairbanks citizens, headed by Game Warden Frank Dufresne, were successful in obtaining 23 Plains Bison from the National Bison Range at Moiese, Montana to start a breeding herd in Alaska. Intended as a hunting resource for the Fairbanks group, it was originally planned to release the bison near Healy, but at the last minute it was decided that the McCarty (now Big Delta) district was more suitable. An abundance of wild grasses and pea vines, with only a couple of dozen scattered trappers' cabins, appeared to make conditions ideal for the transplant.

      Modern bison, standing up to 6 feet at the shoulders and weighing up to 2,600 pounds, are extremely hardy animals, able to stand long periods of poor grazing. Wolves are their main predator. They usually travel in small family groups, a bull and a few cows (which also have horns) and their calves. Following a 9-month gestation, the cinnamon-colored calves, weighing 25-40 pounds (11-18 kilos), are dropped in May or June, just in time for the new grasses which are sprouting.

📷      The Delta herd thrived, increasing to about 500 animals by the late 1940s. As the bison population was growing, however, so was the human population; the opening of Fort Greely eventually brought several thousand people to the area that the bison found so appealing. The number of bison dropped for a few years, at least partially as a result of the ever-decreasing grazing left after the construction of runways, highways and homes. Conflicts were becoming severe by the 1950s - one farmer had a 60-acre field of alfalfa destroyed by grazing bison in one night! At Fort Greely, ""the military spent upwards of half a million dollars to landscape the grounds on the fort. No sooner had the grass put in an appearance than so did the bison. Every blade of grass was eaten (Harmon). By 1960, bison were starving, rooting at the garbage dumps and dying from eating plastic, and cuts from glass and metal.

      Although they are generally peaceful animals, for several years in the 1950s, a particularly obnoxious bull named ""Old Joe"" by Delta Junction area residents, gained quite a reputation for attacking vehicles, crumpling fenders and doors and just generally being a nuisance (Harmon). In the depth of winter, bison would often lean against trailers and cabins to get some of the building's warmth - the resulting ""earthquake"" in the night could apparently be quite unnerving.

      Through this period, the bison were still protected - the Fish and Game Department generally didn't feel that the herd was strong enough to stand any hunting. The exception occurred in 1950 through 1952, at a time when the herd's population was already dropping rapidly, when 25 hunting permits were issued each year. In 1950, 17 animals were also moved to a new range near Slana, on the Glenn Highway. By the late 1950s and '60s, requests for funding to feed the starving bison were being received and turned down, but the 90,000- acre [Delta Junction Bison Range](http://www.wc.adfg.state.ak.us/index.cfm?adfg=refuge.delta_bison) was created in 1979 in response to the problem. The project has been very successful, with the enhancement of grazing areas away from farmers' fields being the primary aim.

      In February 1945, the Yukon Fish and Game Association was formed, and they immediately started lobbying the government to improve hunting. In a very short time this group, composed largely of people new to the Yukon, would become the Territory's most powerful political lobby group, and among their objectives were the importation of bison, elk and mule deer to areas which would allow easy road access to them. In 1951, [5 bison and 19 elk were released](http://www.explorenorth.com/library/history/elk-yukon-1951.html) 50 miles west of Whitehorse; with the assistance of a strong wolf poisoning program in the area, the elk survived, but the bison appear to have all died by 1973. An interesting note to this experiment is that Renewable Resources staff today never admit that it occurred.

      Another bison introduction was attempted in Alaska in 1955, when 5 animals were released on Popoff Island, just east of the tip of the Alaska Peninsula. The last report I've found on this herd is from 1961, when there were still 5 bison there (the same number, but with 2 new calves to replace deaths).

📷      In 1980, the Yukon government started studying re-introduction of bison to the territory, and in 1986, the first shipment of 34 Wood Bison arrived from Alberta's Elk Island herd, which had originated in [Wood Buffalo National Park](http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/nt/woodbuffalo/index_e.asp). This is one of the few pure Wood Bison herds in the world, as most have been allowed to interbreed with Plains Bison. Over the next 4 years, another 136 bison were released, and the herd has now grown to about 1,200 (2014 estimate).",2020-01-14 22:59:24

7jrczm,"Our friends had a Golden who just loved fishing. When we went to their cabin, he would spend like 100% of his time fishing. Except he never ever caught a fish. He would stand stock still in the water until the panfish gathered around his legs, then *SPLASH* plunge his head under to try and catch one. Not once was there any reward other than a snoot full of water, but he'd just be out there. Sunrise to sunset. His passion for fishing was oddly inspirational.

At least when we went fishing, he'd come out on the boat and get to experience success second hand. Turns out his only end game was that he enjoyed licking fish 😂. What a personality that dog had. Dearly missed.",2017-12-14 17:58:26

TIL, As other Redditors has mentioned, they seem to only happen to pandas in captivity. My bad, never knew about this part myself. Well, true. I'd be too busy to have urges dreaming of bamboo forests if I were in captivity.

Also, the other dude: Not even kidding, saw a zoo showing them panda porn once, and that other Wikipedia page. Again it's in a zoo so it proves the clarification right. 🤷🏻‍♂️",2019-07-07 01:05:32

6v4h4k,"☀️Poem Alert🌘

Through today's eclipse, God brought a pretty amazing thought to my mind...

The sun is always there. Always. Day in and day out without fail. It's so bright and powerful we can't really see eye to eye with it. In fact, to attempt to see it with the naked eye would be blinding. So, more often than not, we don't think about its presence. It's just there.

Cue the moon. The moon is relatively smaller than our sun. It doesn't shine unless the sun's light reflects off of its surface. It's not living and active like the sun. Yet, although smaller, less powerful, and without its own source of light, at the right distance, given its size, the moon can block all light from the sun if it comes between us. 

It's not until the moon moves back out of the way that we can relish in the heat and beauty of our bright star. If it were to remain in its place between us, the moon would deprive the earth of its greatest and most important source of energy for life. We would grow cold. We would freeze. We would die. 

Thankfully, the moon continued to move along today and our marriage with the sun, as displayed by the biggest and most beautiful of rings, was restored.

Too often I find myself focusing on the moon. Keeping it at a close distance. Forgetting that it is lifeless. Failing to remember that's it's nothing compared to our sun. 

Too often I fail to soak in the sun's rays. To feel its heat. To understand and acknowledge its presence. 

I allow the little things to get between me and the bigger picture. I focus on what's right in front of me. I forgot what and Who is behind it all. 

If this thought was all that today's magnificent display left me with, I'd be content! Because I know that, in Him, there's so much more. Much more splendor. Much more greatness. 

So look towards the Son. Remember the feeling. Feel the warmth of His embrace. And stay in awe!

PS.: I do not recommend looking at the sun, son.",2017-08-22 03:39:42

1243ggv,"But wouldn’t early castration also affect their muscle growth and joints? I know it does in other species. This is not so much an issue when raising cattle for meat, but becomes one in the long term if you’re trying to train them for work.

It sounds like it’s a trade-off between physical health/longevity and temperament?

Someone else also told me that early castration leads to them kinda having a “dumb baby” mindset for the rest of their lives, which makes training more difficult. (Because dumb babies have shorter attention spans 😅) Though I’ve only heard that one time, from a person speaking on anecdotal evidence, so I’m not sure how true it is. Could be that the ox in question was just naturally a dummy either way.",2023-03-28 17:04:04

I actually encountered one of these guys while I was dolphin hunting off the coast of Panama. We pulled him on board to get him untangled from our net, and let me tell you, this guy was huge.

Many times, if not almost all the times we attempted this, we'd get ""stuck"" and would need a worker to come and help us skate to safety on the outskirts again 😂 Sad thing is, as a almost 30 year old now, I guarantee that I'd get stuck if I tried this again even now 💀",2022-09-15 22:23:16

xevxz6,"Well thats the question.

For ants, they usually die of exhaustion. It happens when they loose the pheromone trail back to the nest, so they switch to following each other.

For sheep, humans usually intervene.

For reindeer, I don't know. If they are doing it on purpose, presumably they chose to start and can therefore choose to stop once the danger has passed. If its accidental...

Basically like with humans stopping sheep, something needs to interrupt the loop so some of the reindeer don't have any other reindeer in front to keep following. A predator causing chaos or the loop drifting into an area with obstacles like trees maybe?

Here's an example of why humans tend to end up stopping sheep tornadoes though. They interfere with out lives 🤣.

Edit, forgot the link: https://youtu.be/9Hq4uNFL0qQ

Edit 2: I love when I get downvotes for stuff like this. When its for a strong opinion about ATLA or something I get it, I insulted your fave character. But with this I'm reading back it trying to guess what might have annoyed people. Was it my video, did they not like the sheep? Are they big ant fans that hate when ants die?",2022-09-15 14:06:53

pyjyb0,Cuckoos parasitise passerines (song birds) and most of those produce fecal sacs as fledglings in the nest so it’s unlikely that a cuckoo would be in a nest with a bird whose chicks don’t produce fecal sacs. There’s a nice article by the Audubon society on fecal sacs and why they’re useful … some adult birds eat it 🤢: https://www.audubon.org/news/what-are-fecal-sacs-bird-diapers-basically,2021-09-30 15:29:06

My *point* is there is no such thing as a non-corrupt superpower, and they will always fester on this planet like an infected wound. 🤷🏽‍♂️ 

(On another note: America’s judicial system and the state of its foreign affairs are not the first things I would think of when I think of the atrocities happening, but different strokes for different folks I suppose.)",2020-01-17 22:59:50
epu0y7,"Agreed! I just think that there are many people who discount all of it specifically for the reason that it's old and must therefore have been replaced with what's true. I also account heavily for the influence that one's beliefs have on the effectiveness of treatment, whatever method is being pursued. Our bodies are complex, but they're also easily tricked. Whether a treatment works because it's scientifically proven to or because the person believed it would doesn't matter much to me... I'm a fan of doing what works for you and letting others do what works for them.

But i also have the unfavorable opinion that some illnesses are meant to be healed and some are meant to be learned from...that's a whole different wormhole though 😂",2020-01-17 15:43:30

I read a little about it. 

They use webs and cotton and grasses etc. to sew up the leaves. They’re tropical and live around Asia. 

I read a couple observations and it said adults only spend a little while in the nest. Like only a few moments or even seconds so maybe that’s why you never see them? They also apparently don’t like being recorded. 

Also you’re right about the cats. The eggs get picked off by predators and the mortality rate is quite high. They lay three on average and it takes around 14 days for the birds to fledge.

“Long ago as far as the eye can see, the world was corrupt but the fisherman underestimated the apes.

And this is the meme that will open up the movie that documents this crazy bullshit saga  I think (and of course Morgan has to do the dialogue) 😂 it’s perfect.

Spayed is correct, though neutered is correct as well. People generally say neutered when referring to testes but it’s encompasses all reproductive organs. The testes specific word is castrated but it isn’t often used because people hear it and are less likely to get their male dogs and cats fixed. Neutered is used instead so people don’t feel as bad.",2021-11-08 21:26:38

I was on my way to the airport one day with my dad (I was ~13 years old) and, as we were taking the back roads, we spied a cow in a field (behind a fence but nearer to the road) who had just given birth; the calf was steaming and everything! It was nuts. We pulled over and watched for about 5 minutes as it came-to and took its first wobbly steps, and were super amazed by it... until the cow turned its head around at us and we realized it was chewing the placenta (like cows chew, in that roundabout movement + dead-stare way) and the sac/fluids were hanging down like 2 feet from her mouth 🤢 I was like ""okaaay, enough nature, gotta catch my flight!"" 😂",2021-05-28 15:14:25

pnhldq,"There was a case where a man was drowned by a swan and his go pro or video equipment of some sort had recorded the whole thing. 
He was in his kayak or canoe when it attacked him, making him fall into the water and every time he came up for air it would attack his head and push him down until he depleted enough oxygen that he could no longer fight back or swim far enough away to stay alive.
That story gave me a whole new appreciation for how strong swans are. I felt like I could for sure either grab it and hurt it or swim under water until I reached a point far enough away that I could get a good breath when I came back up, before diving down again. Apparently this swan was just relentless though and for all I know it attacked under water like a diving duck or some crap. But if it can kill a grown man, it can probably kill lil ole me. 👀

Tldr: swan kills human on home turf.",2021-09-13 21:14:10
pnhldq,"I moved from Scotland to the US 13 yrs ago. After a year or so my parents came to visit (supposedly to see me, but more so to see the US).

i3yezt,Spoonman fun fact it is pretty much known that ball size is directly related to the amount of sexual competition a species encounters.   Chimpanzees have large balls compared to many other primates and multiple chimps compete to impregnate female chimps who are in estrus.  Same is true for house cats 🐈 where multiple male kitties may be seen in a single litter for example.  Same seems true for this dude and his huge balls.    Also your user name is a soundgarden reference yes.,2020-08-05 14:53:06
i3yezt,"There are but not around here, unfortunately. I live in a poorer part of Colorado that doesn't have a lot of extra programs like that. Twice a year they do a voucher program but you got to bring the cats in yourself and they need to have a rabbies shots. Many times they won't except ferals, which is frustrating. I live in a rural town that is transitioning into a regular city. There used to be very little homes where I live just fields. Now there are a bunch of homes being built. Because of this, tons of animals are being displaced. Two of the colonies that have been going for at least ten years are completely gone. I've seen none of those cats. I've seen only a few cats from the colony up the street. The colony I look out for is doing ok and many of these cars I got fixed. Even this colony has lost members. There are about 5 that I haven't seen in about a year. Plus, we have a ton of raccoons and foxes that we didn't have before and they compete for food and shelter, including the food I leave for the cats, so that is a new challenge. Feral cats lead a hard life and  don't live that long, usually without ever knowing kindness. But you're right. One cat can have multiple litters a year. It all adds up. We just gotta do our part and keep getting them spayed/neutered. Showing them a bit of love as we go ☺️",2020-08-10 05:31:31
i3yezt,"Oh, cool! If you got questions I might got a answer for you 😺",2020-08-10 05:45:46
i3yezt,"I agree with the above poster. For about a month I left the food and water out until they understood this was a relatively safe space. Then for the next four months I would feed them ( always at the same time so I knew they would be there) and just sit ( sitting on the ground is important) and look through Reddit or whatever. The youngest kitties started to come to me, after about twoish months. Then one day one just came and sat next to me. They say if you point a finger towards them ( while sitting on the floor) this is kinda like the kitty equivalent of nose to nose sniffing cats do to say hi. The cat will snuff your finger if they are chill with you. Don't try to pet yet, just let them snuff you and get to know you. After awhile, you will be able to tell when they are getting comfortable. They might play around you, walk around you and sit a few feet away from you, or even walk towards you to say hello with the finger nose snuff and then walk away disinterested ( which is a good sign ). After this starts happening, again while sitting on the floor, if a cat starts to sit next to you and chill give it the nose finger snuff then gently try to pet thier head and behind the ears. Usually there will be one that will be the first to do this , while the other ones keenly observe. It's like they send out a sacrificial kitty to see what will happen 😁 After the that first sit down, nose snuff, and pet the other cats will just be a few days or weeks behind. Then they won't leave you alone lol if you can continue this  soon you won't have to sit on the ground to engage. Cats are pretty smart and will start picking up on your cues after awhile. For instance, I like it when they are at a higher level to be petted so they have all learned to jump on things if they want those pets. There will always be a few who will never like to be petted. I have two, Citrus, an old Tom and Creme, a long haired Siamese mix who will get close to me but will probably never be handled. And that's ok. There are about 4 others from this colony that just chill in the background and won't even get close and that's ok , too. These kitties have had hard lives and humans aren't always nice, sometimes they are always going to be too scared to be close friends. But they know I'm here and they know there is a place to go if they need help. Meanwhile I have two who have permanently set up house in my garage and are can tolerate being in doors for about 15 minutes. I have two others who have come along tremendously well and are fine becoming indoor cats. Unfortunately I didn't get one fixed in time ( tnr will not come to this location so I have to find vouchers or pay out of pocket which isn't always easy to do) so now I have 6 of her kittens who are getting ready to be adopted. I have gotten 6 fixed so far and the kittens will be getting fixed soon...not great but better then nothing lol it just takes time and patience. You seem to really care about them and that's half the battle right there. I think you will  do great.",2020-08-10 04:58:48

hj7m6k,"It means If we had the metabolism of a hummingbird, we’d need to eat 140,000 calories a day to keep going. Sort of like the way we convert “dog years” or compare life our lifespans to other creatures.

Too bad I don’t have hummingbird metabolism 🤷‍♀️",2020-07-01 14:33:43
hj7m6k,"I just wonder how they would make that conversion. Because if they did it based on consumption per day, as you seem to be speculating, then hummingbirds would necessarily consume the human equivalent of 2000 Calories per day. Cause... that's how many are consumed in a day 😂

Maybe it's a mass thing. I dunno.",2020-07-01 14:14:10

I've written, and published, the first 2 chapters, but the rest is going to be slowly put together and released together.

I'm also writing a parallel series about someone living on a prison planet, in the same universe, where the prisoners are branded and mind-wiped before being shoved through an enormous gate and into the wildlands to fend for themselves. The planet was ""cleansed"" by the military decades earlier and its sole purpose, now, is to house prisoners that aren't to be executed. The prisoners form their own gangs and groups and have to basically learn how to live in this new situation. The mind-wipes vary massively, they know how to accurately administer them, but the MPs don't care and give everyone the same dose, so some people remember almost everything about their prior life, some remember very little, and some are basically in a vegetative state.",2021-07-27 16:33:36

I’m surprised no redditors have torn you apart for that spelling mistake lol................. just in case you try to edit it out—————-I ""caught"" one of these when I was about 10 or 11 in southern Saskatchewan.  Found it when I got to school, lying on the sidewalk.  At first I thought it was a mask, but turns out it was a really big moth and it was injured and couldn't fly.  Teachers got me a container to put in and poked holes in the lid and took it around to all the classrooms.  It was incredibly clam.

That evening, at home, it started getting restless so Dad and I took it out to the backyard.  Took the lid off, and it flew away.",2020-03-28 04:31:16

t8q1nj,"I have a dog. When I put 5 different things he likes to eat in front of him, he is picky on certain things. Think about juicyness, smell, rich off protein. Most animals smell “different” and way better than humans. Just as a gazelle eats the best grass or whatever plants and berries they eat. In bare times they eat twigs.

Sure we are rich on protein, if we would treat our bodies well, like animals tend to do. Unfortunately a lot people smoke, drink alcohol and fill themself with toxic shit. Ofcourse not everyone, but nowadays I am afraid we are facing times where healthy people become rare. There is a positive movement going on but still supermarkets and other garbage wins.

So hold up...once the ice melts, and the oceans warm, and the temp is warm all around....will wind become extremely weak and rare??

Do we have a limited amount of “cold”? Is our chill on a timer???

Because heat only can radiate via physical reactions, right? Is it possible for heat to dissipate into a vacuum? 

Is there confirmed testing of thermal elements (such as the red heating elements in a toaster oven) in space, completely devoid of atmosphere, managing to give off infrared waves to objects in the distance?????

Getting some zero g panic vibes here... *Gravity* esque, or like that scene in the zero G water sphere in *Passengers*...

I mean shit...are photons even real, or is it just our perception of the sun giving off light, when really it might just be an incredibly dense radioactive ball.....radiating energy which hits the earth...causing an excitation of atoms in the atmosphere....yielding an individual perceiving it to be a ball of bright light..

o6xno7,"Sorrrrry! I am definitely not that type to care about luring people in for likes or follows or any amount of attention. I was merely trying to hype it up to joke with people... but at the same time there is legitimacy to my being scarred by the image. It’s not so much what is being done, but the way it looks. There’s just something about how plump she is and how she’s just feasting the way I imagine a super obese person at a buffet surrounded by food. I am horrified by mukbangs, I suppose there’s just some inherent, negative reaction I have toward people stuffing their faces. 

As far as nature goes, yeah I completely understand this is just nature. And nature typically does pretty well when we humans aren’t interfering with it. I guess these crabs (who normally are land dwellers, something I didn’t know was even possible!) all trek out to a specific part of Christmas Island - some travel for a couple weeks, with the whole trip being a few miles!  They all meet up at the beach, the males find a spot in the shallow water, burrow a hole, and the ladies go find their mate... (or mates, don’t know), and then the preggo crab ladies stay in the hole until they release their crab babies in the water with a squatting, twerking motion.
 
This results in MILLIONS of crab babies COVERING the  beach. Most of them die. Probably starvation or from being eaten as seen with the soon to be mother. So I definitely understand it is probably a necessary thing - it’s just funny because in this case, she’s not eating them not out of scarcity, nor is she eating them as some Darwinian evolution fight to be amongst the fittest by eating other babies in hopes her offspring can outnumber... instead, the eating is actually to quell, or prevent what would easily, easily become an infestation that would destroy the entire island were the millions of crabs to all survive.

The whole thing gives me spring break vibes, though. Crabs journey out to the beach. Some travel for miles, some go for their first time. Some are virgins - they’ve been hearing about this special week for a long time. When they arrive, they get to business. The meet, dance/mate, and the females get pregnant while the males depart leave them behind. Girls have some time to themselves soaking up the sun, some words of wisdom passed down to the young, pregnant for their first time, and being instructed on how they need to twerk to release their babies. Starving from the couple weeks of pregnancy and treading water in the same spot, they finally feast on some snacks before heading home. I, too visited a lovely beach town famous for spring break and crab dinners... just didn’t get pregnant, thankfully.

fsn67i,"Exactly my question.  Its totally possible, but I see no confirmation this isn't at least perspective trick or something.



The giant squid was real and was eventually captured.  Given all the species that go unseen/undiscovered in the depths of nature, I don't doubt that there's a giant/realllly large primate out there which led to all the bigfoot hype, but I don't think it would be bright orange.  I imagine the giant ape has to be a more neutral color in order to evade official discovery.   



But, the change blindness experiment literally used a gorilla suit to blend into the background, so.....who knows.   The ""bigfoot"" primate may be a giant orangutan rather than a giant ape 🤷",2020-04-01 01:02:58

fsn67i,"You've got a point there. They are still strong. My main worry is they simply don't get that humans are weak and fragile, so a playful touch to them might break your rib or something. I'd opt for dealing with a bonobo instead of a chimp any day, but I guess I don't know orangutan behavior well enough either. I wouldn't be worried about a female orangutan, but I believe adult males can be quite aggressive when defending territory or mates. 

And a bonobo isn't just gonna randomly start rubbing up against you, they've gotta at least like you first, lol. Yeah they may have lots of sex but they're not just humping everything that moves. They're not gonna hunt you down and jump you. I haven't heard any stories of that being a problem for people. Chimps on the other hand? If the mood strikes them they'll dislocate your shoulder, bash you on the head, and sink their teeth into you. Mad respect to Jane Goodall, cause chimps are terrifying.

But hey, in an ideal world none of us are ever coming anywhere near any of these animals. Respect nature ✌",2020-04-01 03:04:11

11qf3zk,"I think it got great reviews everywhere. I think the major issue was, that was a perfect ending. Aside from his and Nat's talk. If they had ended it at the team saluting the audience, it would have been a perfect one-off season. That last episode was, dare I say it, Rudy and Hoosiers quality, but with more fucks.

I'm curious to see if they take us into the playoffs or after, and even better, if the team folded and now Shoresy is working some pedestrian job. Can you imagine him as a cashier, like Clerks?

Sorry about that 😅 He's smart enough to know that human babies are like this because they not only have more to develop than other animals, but also because there is nothing that makes them need to rush these skills that they learn. (You know, like having to worry about a lion trying to eat it's face. Since we're the top of the food chain and all) he's just sarcastic enough to sound like a dick on purpose!

Edit to add: I also wasn't totally serious about the thumb sucking thing. I know it's for self soothing. At the time, I went down a rabbit hole thinking about ""why do babies do this when it seems so needless in other creatures."" I was more saying it because that was my first thought, before thinking about the ""why"" and ""how"".

In 2011, the state had 92,300 corn farms on 30,700,000 acres (12,400,000 ha), the average size being 333 acres 

Corn requires from 60 to 100 days to reach harvest depending on the variety and warm weather. 


333 acres = $188,145

666 acres = $367,290

999 acres = $564,435

1 boil it...gross, has to be done outside, extremely messy and costly with all the equipment you’ll need. 
2 flesh eating beetles...expensive to set up and it’s a very fickle system trying to keep those buggers happy and healthy.

deb9av,She bought some property that happens to have an old community grave yard on it. Technically it’s private property now and no one is supposed to bury anyone there anymore but try telling that to families who have lived there for generations. It basically comes down to her not being an asshole and respecting others traditions. It doesn’t hurt anyone in the long run. No one has been buried there in a while but that doesn’t stop wild animals from digging up old bones. Sometimes you just find an old human skull with no apparent owner 🤷🏽‍♂️,2019-10-08 20:46:44

ignjao,">Not a safe neighborhood to be walking alone

🎵 Lions in the night, when you find yourself alone

Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own

Lions in the night when there's no one left to call

You feel the time is right, say the writing's on the wall

It's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' in

Call it what you like it's time you got to win

Lions, lions, lions your spirit's sinkin' down

You find you're not the only stranger in this town 🎵
