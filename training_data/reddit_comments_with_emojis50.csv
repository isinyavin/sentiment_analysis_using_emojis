x96jm9,"It’s kind of like the nation lost its nan (well, for anyone in my generation and younger).

It didn’t matter if your paternal grandmothers weren’t still around, you still had old Liz; who’d like a Martini in the afternoons and loved to watch a bit of Netflix in the evening.

She’d be impeccable in public, but you just knew she probably had an outrageous and witty sense of humour behind closed doors.

x96jm9,"God rest her soul, she’s up there in the sky at the big old after party. 

No doubt she carried her responsibilities with diligence and care for that I’m thankful and quite frankly deeply impressed by, it’s a testament to her character and beliefs that she done so with the selfless dignity that only leaves fond memories. 

For those carrying the burden of shock and duty at this moment in time my heart and sympathy’s go out, do her proud 🥲

mb9qg3,"This is so horrible but I'm not surprised. I had a stalker when I was in uni. He kept calling and masturbating on the phone and knew my full name and where I lived and told me so on the phone :( (my course was small and I knew everyone so I knew it wasn't anyone I knew). 

The police fobbed me off saying just to change my number (ignoring the fact he knew my address) and asked just what I wanted to do. I wanted to press charges because he was sexually harassing me all the time and called on a private number. They told me not to answer private numbers which is stupid considering my GP, the police and foreign number for family back home also showed up as private 😒. They then said well, you'll need to get in touch with your phone provider and they'll have to send us the phone information for him.  I did all of that, my provider blocked his number but I never heard back from the police. I tried to follow it up and they said they closed the case and wouldn't tell me if they found the person or not.

I went 2 years without hearing from the stalker and once I changed provider (kept the same number) the calls started back and he knew that I moved city and said he'd always be there. And yet again the police told me there was nothing they could so. It's been five years but I'm still paranoid that he will find me and start calling again.

I've reported being followed home by a man who physically restrained me and forced me to have him walk me home (he tried to drag me god knows where but I kept making a point that my flatmates were waiting up for me). They told me to not work my job or work late and to take another route home...my alternative route home was extremely dimly lit 😕

I have no faith in the police",2021-03-23 13:05:18
mb9qg3,"When I dumped a toxic ex girlfriend, the threatened to set my car on fire and quote “ruin your life in any way I can”.

I called the local police (Suffolk) and they told me to make a log of every time I was threatened with physical violence.

Nothing was ever done 🤷‍♂️",2021-03-23 10:39:32
mb9qg3,"There is something fundamentally wrong with the police across the globe, it's almost as if they're mostly sociopaths maintaining the status quo and not actually looking out for the well being of every day folks. 🤔",2021-03-23 13:24:46
mb9qg3,So wrong this is. It shouldn't happen but the police don't care at all not unless it's a speeding car or something else like helping get money for the TV licencing people. The police have become a joke and they don't even know it. 🤦‍♂️,2021-03-26 08:07:43
mb9qg3,"A couple of years ago my dad assaulted someone. He was driving and got mad at a cyclist on the road so bumped him with the car, and when he stopped my dad got out the car and started hitting him. Then my dad continued driving to Tesco like nothing happened. I know all of this because my little sister (about 10 at the time) was in the back of the car and told me, crying and petrified and confused, when they got home.

The cyclist reported him to the police, and my dad had to give a statement. He admitted to the police what he'd done and they said his statement matched the cyclist's, but a lady who saw the incident and volunteered as witness decided to exaggerate and said my dad kicked him to the ground and stuff. Because of the 'inconsistencies' in the stories and understaffing they dropped the cyclist's case and nothing happened. My dad didn't even have to write an apology. It has unfortunately made him think he's invincible and always right (even more so than before, the twat 🙄)

Then when telling family/ friends what happened he managed to spin the story and take out the assault part and said he pulled over because he thought he hit the cyclist and wanted to check and apologise. 

I'll never forget how upset my little sister was that day. I feel so sorry for the cyclist. My mum has been wanting to divorce him for years, but my dad has threatened to make her life hell and fight tooth and nail in the divorce, so she hasn't. If the police had done something it could've been the tipping point and make her divorce petition so much easier if my dad was a criminal, but it seems the police couldn't be bothered.",2021-03-23 13:51:42

Like I agree I don't think the restrictions go far enough in problem areas (I would like more pressure on companies with staff in offices to facilitate WFH where possible and fuck places of worship)...

It's just such a stupid inane thing to keep saying ""oh the virus only comes out when you see your mate hurhur"".

You can marry a 60 year old at 16. 
It's the ""age of legal capacity act Scotland 1991"" if you want to check the specific regulations.

I also don’t think he’s a bad person or very much blame him for going on the trip (that’s on BA). But the message of supporting the NHS and doing what’s right has been tarnished by this whole thing. 

What people are missing is that it’s less about him catching it and more about spreading to others. I have family in the Caribbean and I don’t appreciate anyone travelling there in the height of a pandemic because they want a bit of sun, it’s just not reasonable no matter how much we all want it. I’ve had to attend my own grandmother’s funeral via zoom (when it was legal to travel mind) because it’s just not responsible to travel at the moment.

What’s worse is that if he’d stayed for just three more days he could have been vaccinated and then gone on the trip once immunity had kicked in.

However, at the end of the day despite my criticism of the situation it is a stark reminder that we are all human. We should not be deifying and we should not be vilifying either. I hope he is resting peacefully.",2021-02-02 20:07:36

But in the UK it was just “mirror, signal, manoeuvre”. Or maybe I just had a rubbish driving instructor 🤷🏻‍♀️. But I remember my British boyfriend being the same way, and one time he almost hit a cyclist while turning and brushed it if with “well, I checked my mirror”.

sggy2r,"i had agoraphobia for pretty much half my life (im 28 😳) and was on esa as a result. agoraphobia was a result of ocd left to fester, i wouldn’t leave the house unless i really needed to (like, desperately needed to) and when i did have to leave the house, i had to go through a panic attack before i could even open the front door. i was obsessed with the idea that someone was hiding outside my door waiting to kill me or throw acid at my face and it impacted even how i navigated my own house, which is to say i’d keep the blinds down and never look outside ever because someone on a nearby rooftop would use that moment to snipe me and it really just resulted in me spending all my time in one particular corner of my house where i felt safe and unseen. couple this with depression and a whole lot of other shit, i was down bad.

esa told me that because i was able to walk down the corridor to the examination room, make eye contact, and “seemed in good spirits”, that i was fine actually. 

i’m on universal credit now. lost my job during covid due to how badly it affected my ocd/agoraphobia all over again. recently they cut that £80 a month off payments, and i’ve got no other income and no support in job searching aside from being told if i don’t get a job they’ll cut off my uc (cue another ocd obsessive loop about becoming homeless) and at the end of every month without fail i’ll be below £10 in the bank. no matter how tight arsed i am, no matter how little i spend on things i don’t need, i’m barely scraping by. if they keep cutting or raising prices im absolutely utterly fucked.

it’s so scary. it’s so hopeless. sometimes i catch myself returning to having suicidal thoughts which i haven’t had in years, but the more i think about the future and how much more of a struggle it’ll become, i just feel like there’s no way out. this isn’t how i wanted adulthood to be.",2022-01-30 23:10:32

That makes sense, I guess in a way perhaps it comes down to how much room you have in your life for that particular issue, I can imagine many people possibly don't want to think about it, about the suffering and everything, because it's disheartening and depressing. But that doesn't help stop it, like you say. 

But I suppose the same could be said of clothes, computers, diamonds, mining, and so many other things; I suppose in a way, we all have issues we're comfortable facing and ones we're not, it's just a matter of choosing which is which for each individual. To consider every wrong in the world would just be crushing.

But yeah, hopefully as more and more people go down the road of plant-based stuff, it'll become easier for others to do the same. At the very least, I hope that the welfare of farm animals improves significantly.

Surprise surprise they’ve offered her the job back, but at the time she was shot down by multiple organisations and news posts about her “bigoted” mindset?!

As a white British male applying for the RAF as we speak, this doesn’t fill me with hope.

I also applied for many scholarships associated with aviation. One was to leading edge flight school.

I paid £50 for their scholarship test, and surprise surprise I didn’t pass. They did tell me however I was good enough to join their school as a student just not smart enough to be a scholar. Well I called up and asked for some more information as to why I wasn’t accepted, they wouldn’t give me a dime of information, no “hey this is what could have been done better” absolutely nothing. After countless emails they eventually started ignoring me, and I’ve not heard anything since.

All I want to do is fly, and whether that’s for the RAF or banner towing across the south coast of the UK, it’s all I want to do.

Lol ok. Im working class but ok 👍  dumb fuck. And I clearly said until the war. The current situation is awful. But like I say, most countries are experiencing this. Even Germany is having massive foodbank usage and theyre a stronger economy than us and in the EU. 

>The only thing I can concede is that the ImBrexiles are liars, and pretty much all my predictions happened or are happening. Nice of you to try to put everything on Putin, but it's not gonna fly.

Well Putin didnt decide that we should embargo him. I dont blame Putin for that. But I dont wanna get dragged into a discussion about a war that you are told to see black and white so ill leave it at that. The government chose to cause an oil shortage so they have to take responsibility for that, not Putin or Brexit.

>It's still nowhere close to pre-2016 levels especially in comparison to the Euro.

Yet even the 2016 levels were quite a bit higher than where it was at just a few years before. So it effectively fell from a peak. Besides, to be honest the pound has been overvalued for ages. There is more to the economy than just the value of the pound, and having it too high is actually very harmful too. So that alone doesnt massively worry me. If growth doesnt pick up then thats when you should be concerned, but of course the recession should have been well under way by now. You cant give a prediction with a clear time frame and then when it doesnt happen say ""but I was right. I was just 5 years off on the time frame youll see"". Thats not really a prediction is it and definitely cant be called accurate.

Overall, brexit was pointless. None of the good bits really and lets be honest a European super state is the only way any of our tiny nations will keep any sort of influence over the next 100 years. All for that personally.",2022-07-08 22:23:47

Either way, you can't judge him on his wealth - and let's consider the facts alone. That is that his money is his wife's.

pi8qbr,"There are a couple of cultural aspects to this non-Brits wouldn't understand:

- a culture of deference. Britain is strictly divided up by class (wealth is a big aspect of this but there are other signifiers like attitudes to education, how people speak and so on) and those 'lower down' the social pecking are effectively taught that those 'higher up' deserve to be there by some kind of natural force, and that this order should not be challenged in any way. What an outsider might rightly call luck a British person might think of as ""the way things are"". 

The monarchy is the ultimate expression of the social pecking order: people think the monarch is some kind of neutral benevolent managing the national interest fairly even though there's plenty of evidence this isn't the case

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/07/revealed-queen-lobbied-for-change-in-law-to-hide-her-private-wealth

- zero political education. No-one in the UK is taught how the government works, the history of modern politics in the country or how laws are made. The subtext of this is ""it's none of your business"". This helps maintain the status quo and keeps people challenging the social order. Historically, working class people (men initially, and women of most/all classes) were blocked from voting because it was felt they weren't stakeholders in society, and their employer (or in the case of women, their husband) voted on their behalf. The main criteria of whether you were worthy of the vote was literally wealth: ownership of private property or earning/renting something of a certain value

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Act_1832

Again, this makes the assumption that the person voting won't do it in their own personal interest at the expense of others. People are looked down on in the UK: elections in the country are still held on Thursdays because it is assumed by Friday people will be too drunk to vote

pi8qbr,"In regards to the monarchy there are many, many brits who don't support the system we have I am one of them. In fact I beleive those who dont support it or at least who have serious problems with it are in the majority. I have never understood why we still have an unelected head of state its unjust and arcahic and the problems with this type of system have been apparent throughout the years, i mean look at the recent headlines regarding Prince Andrew who despite being accused of literally using a women who has been trafficed and is still getting tax payers money to support his lifestyle and appears to be immune to paying for his crimes just because of whose vagina he fell out of. Absurd and unjust. 
 
Having said that there are also many who seem to have blind loyalty to the system we have in place all be it most of them seem to be the older generation. When it comes to the monarchy some brits support it as blindly as some Americans seem to support the lax laws on guns. Also there is some advantage to having an head of state who is essentially a figurehead with no power and then elected government. The theory is the monarchy is something that can add consistancy and unify us while an elected government is tempoary and obviously will always cause some division. Even I have to admit I enjoy the pagenty around them and I would have them out of Buckingham palace into a trailer park working the checkouts at tescos in a heartbeat 🤷‍♀️

As for why people put up with it. Many people do not truely understand how the HoL or monarchy works and even amoungst those that do most people are to busy with their own lives. People who have full time jobs and whom are used to the system have bigger things to worry about. And even amoungst those that see the system as truely unjust often worry about even more pressing issues such as climate change. On top of that when we vote we have never had the option of getting rid of the monarchy. Well not really there are a few parties that have had that as part of their manisfesto in their time but because we have a two party system its pretty much impossible to ""vote"" on the continuation of the monarchy and even if a party got in with that as part of their agenda they would still need to get it through the HoC & HoL and make a pretty substantial change to the constitution which atm is highly unlikely no one has the political will to do so.",2021-09-28 21:56:32
pi8qbr,"Pretty sure this is how it'll go - Charles has already made it widely known he intends to dramatically slim down the monarchy, even compared to how much its been slimmed down today over 20 years ago. So people will get used to not seeing royal involvement in things that its been common in under the Queen.

I wouldn't be shocked if Charles' coronation is last big coronation, I think for William it'll be a much smaller affair. 

Charles will also only be on the throne for a short (comparatively) period, and whilst William is reasonably popular (compared to the rest of the royals) I think with the death of Charles the overall opinion will swing seriously away from the monarchy as an institution. 

It'd be really quite ironic if the last King of the modern monarchy had the same name as the first King of the modern monarchy 🤣",2021-09-05 12:18:09

They like the confidence, the audacity, the language, he doesn't need to be physical specimen or have character. He has status, opulence and is worldly.

All that before you get into the fact he is a highly manipulative person, so among most women who are susceptible he can ""act"" the part long enough to let women fool themselves that he is worth their time.

Of course, SNP is no where near 66%[1] on a YES/NO question so they'd never go for that even though it's the right thing to do.  Other countries, when making big constitutional changes, have to have minimums for approval to ensure it is a majority decision.

But I guess everyone will just say ""but brexshit didn't have that"" and, yes, just look at how fucked the UK is now.  Sick man of the world with only industrial stalwarts like Russia below us economically. 🤦‍♂️🙄

I think this is the elephant in the room and I don't even know what the SNP's stance on it is.  Probably a big fat ""no minimum requirements"" because they want independence at any cost ... sounds a lot like the brexshitteers ...

To show up to the doctor and it turns out they’re  having a shit day perhaps so they don’t put their best foot forward sucks. Especially considering providers and healthcare workers are held to the Hippocratic oath.

The idea of demanding tests and especially “asking your doctor about “x” medication “ is strange.

Like why am I asking my doctor for meds? Shouldn’t they be telling me what meds I should consider?🤷🏼‍♂️",2021-02-27 11:47:38

 I recall going to a place in the Bronx called ""City Isand"" which was a fishing port & had a wide array of seafood restaurants from fast food to fine dining. Every inch of the place was packed, as it was ""labour day Weekend"" They had some really nice tasting food spots, both the finer dinning & the fast food spots where they had things on the menu that looked like this however, this is not what we Brits are used to seeing when we ask for ""Fish & Chips""  but I'm sure this still tastes great though 😋 just not the the heavily battered, tumeric gold crunchy piece of succulent Fish, whether that be Cod, haddock, plaice, Rock Huss... lashings & lashings of obligatory Salt & Vinegar & a wedge of lemon. Also sides of tartar sauce & my favourite ""Mushy Peas.."" 

And sorry, to those who may like ""Curry Sauce"" with their fish & chips,  ut IMHO, it has no place with a good piece of battered fish, although each to his/her own.

The one thing I'll say about most ""chip shop"" curry sauces, is that they usually appear to be some kinda basterdised by- product of ""proper curry"" where they take a curry ""of sorts"" probaly not proper & add a load of processd ingredients, sugar, flavourings & additives etc... And call it a Condement... That it may be, ""to some"" not me however, as  I think It's simply rank! But that's just me... So, bite me, come for me, whatever, I'm ready...

I was told he would be arrested undersuspcion of rape. But then, I felt the police turned on me because I felt guilty for speaking out and told them so.  Then my family turned on me and didn't believe me either. I ended up taking an overdose and ended up in hospital for a few days. 
My ex had that look in his eye too and manipulated everyone around me. My parents apologised to him while I was in hospital. I found this out a week after being home (getting treated really coldly and hostile by my family)
I tried to tell the police that I suspect my ex date raped me because he couldn't control me one night. The policeman said that I'd probably had too much to drink.

Dude seriously, its pretty obviously the memes, not the genes. Getting a kid interested in learning from a young age by reading to them and encouraging them to read themselves, doing more educational activities and interacting with them a lot as a parent rather than just sticking them in front of a tv is going to have far more impact on thier journey through education than genetics. 'Genetics is the most important factor' is the most laughable thing ive ever heard, there are any amount of examples of siblings children having wildly different academic performances and it almost always comes down to how much the parent(s) actually care about thier kids.

Broadening the scope frome academic intelligence, anyone can tell you why kids become similar to thier parents, and its because of the culture they are raised in. And that is difficult to change. And its blindingly obvious that   making poor parents less financially stable is not going to give them more time to spend with their kids.

But whatever, its clear you love your feeling of superiority as 'one of the superior breed of smart people' who are above those dirty stupid poors. For the average fascist, youve been surprisingly direct about your desire to remove the problematic undesirables from your utopian future society.",2022-04-06 20:04:50
txfinu,Thank you ❤️,2022-04-06 13:40:47
txfinu,"Alright, lets suppose genetics are the most important and deciding factors for someone intelligence. Even though the first line of the study you posted says parents have a greater effect than genetics. And even then, its not a binary system of clever rich people and unintelligent poor people 

1) If we do kill all the filthy poor leaches who are sucking up too many benefits and not paying enough taxes, who will clean the toilets? The world is driven by a huge number of lower skilled, very hard working jobs, and I even agree with you that its probably wrong to push everyone into university, which is why the funding for vocational education is important.

2) If someone's intelligence and job and earnings are almost entirely predilicted by thier genes, then surely lower skilled jobs shouldnt pay less than higher skilled jobs? After all, those people in higher skilled jobs didnt work any harder to get there, it was just them having clever genes, and likewise people without qualifications shouldnt be 'punished' for failing at school, because it was never possible for them to pass their exams because of their genetics. Since both of these examples have done the best they can do in life, they should be paid and taxed (in a way that supports the state treasury you are oh-so worried about) equally, because they are both putting in an equal amount of effort.

3) Perhaps that last one was a bit too radical for you. Even so, if """"""Tiffany and Chad"""""" will only ever produce kids that are good for a low skilled warehouse or fast food jobs or something, but if they can barely afford to live themselves in this (as you have pointed out) very tenuous economy, surely providing benefits to allow them to have kids is nesscessary otherwise there will be a shortage of such workers. I can tell that you would be very against immigrant workers who take money and healthcare and schooling from our 🇬🇧Glorious Nation😤 and send it back home, which would of course place them into your much-detested 'net loss' category.

Bonus point 4) Notwithstanding your ideas of 'net takers' and 'net contributors' are a fallacy because poor people will immediately spend money given to them on things they need and reintroduce it to the economy, while it is the very rich who hoard wealth, avoid tax and move money outside the economy.",2022-04-06 21:17:37

kxr1ab,"So there are actually a pretty specific set of rules for if disease eradication is possible. 

1) The disease is easily diagnosable or recognizable: Now this one is interesting because covid is a lot like the flu or common cold, but we are able to identify it via testing very easily and reliably and our rapid tests will only continue to get better so I'd say this one is a ✅

2) There is no non-human reservoir: as far as we know bats can carry Covid-19 just like they carry SARS or other coronaviruses so this is a ❌

3) The disease is geographically isolated: This is pretty obviously a ❌ at this point

4) There is a vaccine or other transmission interruption strategy: ✅✅✅✅✅

So with this information it looks like we cannot eradicate the disease. However, eradication is the idea that we completely remove the disease from humans forever like we did with smallpox. We can eventually eliminate Covid-19 in individual countries by reducing the incidence of the disease to 0 by using control measures. If we can vaccinate enough people and continue to wear masks and use other control measures, Covid-19 can be eliminated on a country by country basis.

z0agff,"Can’t be the only one who finds this a low-key immature and arrogant move from BBC that’s not ok for many reasons: 
1)As the national broadcaster that’s paid by our TV licences (whether or not people use the BBC), it’s their job to broadcast the biggest sporting event in the UK to the fullest extent they are expected to. To not do so is almost a scam and a disservice to UK payers.
2)The BBC is paid to be non-political. Whether or not they agree with Qatar’s actions, they don’t have the right or responsibility to do anything about it.
3)The UK is not morally clean enough to make judgements on any other countries when we are responsible for the deaths of thousands in the illegal invasion of Iraq, when we still supply weapons to Saudi to destroy Yemen, when strangely migrant workers here are twice as likely to die than UK staff. Not saying we shouldn’t call them out for what they’ve done wrong but to refuse to broadcast their opening (when we would be pretty annoyed if they’d done done that to us) is an act of both arrogance and  ignorance of our own problems. 
4)Also I do think a lot of people in this Reddit will have also read deceptive stats and info about Qatar that fuels this hatred. E.g., the guardian stated that 6,000+ migrant workers died which is true but ignores the fact that this is across the country and doesn’t refer to only work place incidents. Newsflash, people die 😱. But only 3 have died linked to the World Cup. And for women living there from what I’ve heard seems pretty good from someone I know for everyone concerned about sexism. I really do think internalised racism and bias within all of us has affected the judgements people have made about Qatar and the BBC has just reinforced that",2022-12-04 01:25:17

White people are **not** materially disadvantaged by not getting to interrupt safe spaces created by people of colour to explore and deal with the ways *they've* been disadvantaged. White people aren't losing anything by not being invited to places where black people (or any other minority) feel like they can talk freely and openly about that stuff without repercussion. You seem to not understand why discrimination is a problem. Discrimination isn't bad because people 'feel bad uwu 🥺' about being excluded. Discrimination is bad when it leads to negatives impacts on and outcomes for peoples' lives. Not being able to go to a show for one night doesn't make life harder for white people.

Let's be honest, in almost every circumstance where people of colour talk about our legitimate concerns and experiences of racism and white people are present, they get defensive and can be belligerent.

>you are hamstringing your movement. You are enforcing the divisions that the system has created and ensuring that your perspective is not shared amongst those with more power.

Not every single goddamn conversation or discussion has to be about educating white people though? Like it's perfectly possible to have those conversations where perspective is shared, *as well as* conversations where oppressed groups are able to internally figure their stuff out. You're creating a false dichotomy. Not everything should have to be activism against people either. Oppressed people should get to just live their lives and create spaces where they feel comfortable since society as a whole can be so uncomfortable.",2023-05-21 22:54:23

We must rejoin to give us some of our rights back and to ease financial issues. But the really annoying thing is we won't have it as good as we did before.

What people were so blind to was - maybe being part of the EU wasn't 100% perfect, but we at least had a say. Now we have zero say yet still have to follow many of the things people didn't like. On top of losing many of our rights, and lots of annoying and expensive red tape and paperwork. 

That's 100% why the UK is being hit the hardest with everything - Brexit. 

It might not be as good as we had it, but I think we'd still be better off than we are now with whatever future agreements are.

Not to mention we've probably spent decades worth of EU membership etc... In just a few years with so much being wasted and going into Tory pockets. 

If we get our freedom of movement back, and be in the same customs union (so there's no expensive fees and red tape for import/export) then I'd pretty much be happy with whatever else they did.

You don't get to trek across a multitude of safe and developed countries and settle in the one you find to be the must suitable economically and call yourself a refugee. That's not refuge. That's economic migration.

I know that reddit is populated by woke morons who will downvote this to oblivion, but someone has to speak out against this bullshit and I know for a fact that many people agree but are scared of being crucified by the mob.

Maybe you ought to live in Germany, where during the peak of 'refugee' migration, there was an organised Sex attack on New Year's Eve by North African migrants on thousands of German women. See how many people still want more migrants flooding into Europe.

Maybe you ought to read the Google reviews of the 4 star Hotel in Scarborough by people staying there at the same time it was trashed by Afghan refugees who were housed there by the council. Who were spitting, shitting, pissing, knocking over old people, and breaking the lifts.

1ag5lzw,"I think it’s a reaction to progress. The patriarchy is slowly receding like a glacier. 

Feminism, by design, was always going to rebalance power. This was required to reflect equality. 

But the only power that was lost was power that the patriarchy never should have had in the first place: agency over women.  

I think you’ll find that most men that view feminism in a negative light are fairly insecure. By empowering women they perceive that their main method of retaining power (an unfair game) has been lost. 

Healthy men are turned off by patriarchal society.  Unhealthy men are turned off by empowering women. 

There’s no going back now thankfully, because what patriarchy didn’t see coming was allowing women into the workplace as a societal norm meant… that’s right folks women have careers. Which means they have their own ability to provide the resources to sustain their own lives. 

So even if society *tried* to go backwards, we can’t because women have leverage now. They have their own lives outside of patriarchal control.

Like, I don't know, a couple of decades of increasingly loud and widely accepted dismissal, ridicule, and vilification of men in relation to women claiming to have been oppressed for a thousand years whilst men got to live lives of freedom, control, and luxury, with women increasingly getting to choose what they gender roles look like whilst reinforcing the traditional roles of men, alongside a crippled economy and nuclear wasteland of a political environment in which those men can't reasonably prove themselves worth existing via typical financial and family-building means?

This whole area of EU trade alignment was misrepresented for 40 years and yet still people want to pretend that it was about national sovereignty. Newsflash for ya - out in the grown up real world, when you make trade deals the trading partner will often want something in return. That generally means acquiescing or giving up a teeny bit of sovereignty. That is how trade deals work. Otherwise you’re looking just taking what you want by force, kinda like the UK did a couple hundred years ago. Problem is, we can’t do that now which really annoys the Farage brigade.

nryyu2,"> but how cheap people can be bought for

Ok, this is how corruption goes (and it's the same in every industry, not just politics), let's follow along:

1. Mr Businessman gives Mr Corruption or his nominated person / party a small registered sum (""the donation"") of between, say,  £5,000 and £50,000 for a meeting. This is Legally Allowed™ and the part of it you see.

2. Mr Corruption offers to give Mr Businessman a contract or loan of significant value, in return for a significant percentage of that value being returned to a nominated company (through a 'fake' contract that the nominated company is paid for but fails to deliver) or through a person (paid as a contractor).

3. Mr Businessman sets up the required contracts.

4. Mr Corruption uses the nominated company (or several) to launder that money back into either his own coffers or the party in small amounts beneath the threshold for declaration.

None of this is anything new.

This is the reason we don't get to speak to our bank managers now, and the reason all bank loans go through a specific department in your bank. In the Boomer Before Times (pre 1990) Bank Managers would quite openly offer loans as long as the company would secretly pay the bank manager between 10 and 15%. This is how my boomer parents got their business funded several times, apparently.

If you've ever dealt with planning applications for commercial endeavours, you have almost certainly been asked for a bribe by councillors.

These are the effects of leaving a 'UNION'.

A Union is protection against exploitation, and support when you need it.

We were advised against breaking from the European Union in 2016 by a report published by HM Government.... it described everything that is happening right now! ...but still, a majority voted for BREXIT 🤕

This supposed upcoming indyref23 will fail, if Scotland breaks from another UNION, it will be even worse than it is now.

I don't understand why people who voted don't understand the purpose, the reason, the benefits of being in a Union.   - well actually I do understand, it was all down to social media brainwashing, provocative newsfeed, and I suspect those who knew they would benefit and be free to exploit the UK, and bleed it dry, spent a lot of money lying to British people to convince them that breaking from a union would benefit them all.

ITS SO SIMPLE - part of a union = safe, protected.... if you aren't, then you are WIDE OPEN TO CORPORATE EXPLOITATION!! ...from within and without the UK.

I think political parties like UKIP, and SNP should be rounded up and stoned in public.   - it's so obvious they were created, and paid for to do one thing.

....break up the UK, so the rich, and soulless could exploit and bleed our country dry.

There will be a reckoning... and this 'Breaking News' means NOTHING !!! .... the damage has been done.

...and the Scottish Government sat back, and allowed it all to happen - it's like the SNP want us all to suffer, and things to go bad, so we will vote independence (like it's a solution)..... BUT THE OPPOSITE WILL HAPPEN.

If Scotland does vote independence, then Scotland really is full of stupid people who read 'THE SUN', eat pies, and drink IRN BRU.

Why does the government allow unchecked corporate greed to flourish? .... we are on the brink of civil unrest, neighborhoods stock piling weapons, businesses getting smashed up etc.... riots being planned 'offline'.

‘Huurr durr dey made Netflix documentary tho’.

…Ok. And if you don’t like either of these people from the outset and you still chose to spend several hours of your life watching it, then you’re an idiot who just wasted several hours of your life reinforcing an opinion you already held about two people you’ll never meet.

On a basic human level I can see why they left the UK if they’re dealing with stuff like this though. 

Both the US and the UK media is full of spiteful, horrible personalities. They promote an environment where people who say awful, sensationalist things rise to the top because that sells newspapers and content. There’s plenty of well publicized examples of that here in the US.

What really pisses me off is when some people in the UK like to look down their noses at America and think they’re somehow above all of that.",2022-12-18 14:31:59

So what gold is there to dig? They even offered to work for free in exchange for a reduced role. 

What gold is she digging? 

They had to rely on the kindness of Tyler Perry, who never met them at the time for housing and security because Harry had NO MONEY.

v7ksji,"Love it when veganists get karma. Veganism literally rots your brain. We're not herbivores, we need meat. The only true omnivores are bears. PETA needs to be proscribed as a hate group (is the Animal Liberation Front still a thing...? If so, ditto). 

PETA members once sent death threats to BTO, WWT and RSPB volunteers for ""mass murder"" - the 'victims'...? Rats. It didn't like the fact that they were removing rats from Lundy (which is a breeding site for Puffins, Manx Shearwaters, and Common Terns, which are all ground-nesting, and endangered in the UK). ""Rats are innocent, sentient, beings. They have feelings!"" And rare seabirds don't...? They were asked to come up with a plan for the rats... never did find out what they came up with. I have ZERO time or tolerance for veganists; being vegan will NOT save the planet (if we don't eat the ickle-wickle 🐮🐷🐔🐑, they're going to breed - where do veganists propose putting their offspring...? Veganism is a threat to biodiversity).

Did you hear about the time PETA demanded the village of Wool in Dorset change its name to 'Vegan Wool', because it was promoting ""sheep abuse"" (this is, of course, another thing PETA doesn't get; we BRED domestic sheep to have thick, continuously growing fleeces, wild sheep don't. Evidently PETA believes it's LESS cruel to allow sheep to slowly roast to death). 'Wool' is a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon word for 'well' (as in underground spring), and dates from at least the 9th century (it's mentioned in the Domesday Book). Elisa Allen (PETA CEO as was) sent all the residents vegan wool blankets  - they had a parish council meeting and pissed themselves. Funny they've never protested Upper and Lower Slaughter, isn't it...? Derived from the same root as 'Slough', and means wet land or wetland. Nothing to do with 'murdering' animals. It's also mentioned in the Domesday Book. 

Oh and then there was the time they picketed a turkey farm near Gloucester and the farmer had his best Xmas ever - people said they'd not known of its existence until PETA showed up! He wrote to Elisa Allen to thank her for the free advertising! 😂😂😂",2022-06-08 18:55:06

v7ksji,"So this is the actual definition of Veganism: 

""Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.""

I would agree that no form of agriculture is perfect but that plant based agriculture is the least bad option, and one which I would argue results in the least suffering and death over all. 

Some animal deaths are unavoidable i.e the insects in a crop. Whereas breeding a pig into existence, mutilating it, giving it a miserable life for x months and then gassing it painfully to death (how most pigs in the UK are killed) is completely avoidable. 

I'm on mobile so apologies if I've missed anything out! 👍

Edit: with regards to animals being pastured, during the winter pasture animals are fed pre cut vegetation from the summer months so are still fed some kind of grown crop (hay/gras etc). And pigs and chickens also are given feed. I think it's widely recognised that a plant based agriculture system would drastically reduce the net animal deaths and land used (that would be reduced by over 2/3rds I believe, and the animal death would drop especially when looking at animals from the ocean) although I don't have the statistics to hand (on mobile sorry) but if you have a quick Google you'll see.",2022-06-08 11:41:21

I mean going over old tatt's,  freaking ouch!!😬  I try to get mine brightened up every now & then so I know the pain of going over an old tatt. Not sure how old the kids are here, assuming they are little. I get that the other kids are scared, & the conclusion I have come to, they should have brought her in before the play, let her talk about the tattoos & what they mean to her(sans the addiction!) have her hang out for the day & let them touch her face to see nothing will happen to them. And go from there. If she still has some lookers, gather them up again & let them ask more questions. If there are still questions, have the children write their question & send them home with the Mom's child. I think that child will feel really special if that happens, I hope anyways!! I am a counselor & did a rotation with kids & loved it. Knowing you are helping to develop healthy relationships & giving them a good firm foot forward is spectacular!! But, all of you teachers out there, you HAVE to open your mind a bit more. If you think your child will never encounter this out without you, you are wrong!

The stark reality is that people still don't and are unlikely to accept facial tattoos because it detracts from having a 'normal' and less intimidating face. The fact is that if you chose to cover yourself full well knowing it's likely to impact your ability to attend your child's school events, be eligible for certain jobs etc, that's your own fault, and tbh I don't blame the school for their decision, you should've thought about it. Personally I love tattoos, I have some myself, but you gotta be smart about it, get them where they can be covered up in a professional environment, that way you can still get majority ink coverage and still go about your day without being discriminated against or penalised for visible tattoos on identifiable locations 👍🏻",2022-12-22 23:45:11

z3g69x,"Our little island will soon be overwhelmed. Minorities in our own country soon enough. Massive population booms in Africa, china and India while ours decreases. Likely the same places where we see the majority of our immigrants come from.

Now this is where the downvotes come in. It is being peddled to us en masse that this is and will be a culturally diverse nation. Every advert on tv now basically features a coloured/mixed family or a ethnic family with mixed members. Told that we can have no other option than acceptance or be cancelled personally and professionally in your career. It’s coming in hot and hard as well! Just need to bend over and take it and accept it’s happening. Fold to the left side of politics and accept we are dirty corrupted Caucasians who have lived a life of privilege and it should stop. 

We make up a very small portion of the different ethnic groups that make up the world and we are heading down a path of complete annihilation of our culture and heritage. Remote regions of Scotland where they have been pure Celt for hundreds and hundreds of years you’d be lucky to find a Scottish person there! 1/6 people in Wales were not from this country and I don’t even want to talk about England! 

If everywhere is diverse nowhere is diverse. People need to speak up about how this mass migration needs to stop and we as a country need stricter laws on who comes in! It’s a sad thing to see the culture and heritage of this island slowly disappear but it will eventually be completely gone.

No evidence that migration has reduced the quality of  healthcare.

scdvb1,"If you’d been an advanced-age adult during decimalisation, and experienced how your wartime/postwar threepenny sweets and shilling meals had already ballooned (to a shilling for the treats and a half crown for the meals) by 1968, and THEN had to suffer the damn retail indignity of doubled prices from 1969-71 when most UK merchants finessed the conversion of 240d-pound prices to 100-p pound pricing (failing to adjust downward by 60% for a true conversion, and instead only slightly reducing the nominal price in d to a new near price in p) you’d really understand annoyance of artificial inflation. Suddenly the treats were 10p (two twentieth’s of a pound instead of one, as a shilling used to be) and the meals were 25 to 50p (which would have been one to two crowns, a mere eighth to a quarter of a pound under the old £)  This
meant doubling, or even tripling prices at a whim just from 1969 to 1972, and most were too busy or confused or mentally lazy to cry foul. Most shoppers shrugged as structural inflation froze the damned doubled retail prices into place. 

But aye, they were downright precise as rocket engineers when bargaining wages using the converted currency. Most folks’ pay stagnated. 
When they’d bargain they were ridiculed for demanding to keep up with the proliferation of doubling and tripling retail prices, and got 15%. 
No wonder there were so many strikes 1967-75. Then to top it off we got muscled into the EEC. 

That sinister conversion process of 1969-71 was the seminal moment for the past half century of UK currency debasement and the forced wedding to EEC were twin outrages perpetrated on a bewildered public 1968-78. And those of us whose age was in double digits or even 40/50 by then had to suffer through every damned day of it.

mif8fc,"The drugs  minister has been accused of a “massive conflict of interest” after it  emerged that her husband operates Britain’s largest cannabis farm.

Victoria  Atkins has now stopped speaking for the government on cannabis and  other aspects of her drugs brief. The Home Office said she had  “voluntarily recused herself from policy or decisions relating to  cannabis”.

Her  husband, Paul Kenward, is managing director of British Sugar, which  last year started growing substantial amounts of marijuana in  Wissington, Norfolk, under a licence from the Home Office, the  department at which she is a minister. The crop covers an area  equivalent to 23 football pitches.

Growing the drug is normally illegal, with a penalty of up to 14 years in prison. However, Kenward’s crops are for  a new epilepsy medicine soon to be approved in the US, although  Atkins’s government is sceptical on the medical use of cannabis. The  licence was issued in 2016 before Atkins became a minister in 2017.

She  does not declare Kenward’s role in the register of ministerial or MPs’  interests, though she mentioned it in a debate when she was a  backbencher. Cabinet Office guidelines say interests held by the “close  family members” of ministers should be declared where they “are, or  might reasonably be perceived to be, directly relevant to a minister’s  ministerial responsibilities”.

Steve  Moore, of Volteface, a think-tank on drug policy, said: “The medical  use of cannabis and its wider decriminalisation is rising up the  political agenda. But we have the ridiculous situation of the drugs  minister being unable to speak in parliament or make decisions on one of  the most important parts of her job.”

Atkins,  a barrister and former criminal drugs prosecutor, has been a firm  opponent of decriminalising or regulating cannabis, saying its brief  downgrading to a class C drug during the Blair government had a  “terrible” impact and that the “gun-toting criminals” who control the  trade would not suddenly “become law-abiding citizens” if it was  legalised.

In  her first three months in her post, between November and early February,  Atkins gave 17 Commons speeches or ministerial parliamentary answers  about drugs, including several on cannabis-based drugs known as  cannabinoids. In the three months since, she has not spoken about drugs  in the Commons and has answered only six written questions on the  subject.

📷Victoria Atkins opposes drug decriminalisationCHRISTOPHER FURLONG

Drugs  questions are now largely answered by Nick Hurd, the policing and fire  minister, who has given 16 parliamentary answers on the subject since  February, many of them on cannabinoids, compared with only a handful  before.

One  written question on legalising cannabis for medical use, from the  Labour MP Roger Godsiff, originally shown as answered by Atkins, has  been changed on the parliamentary website to show it was answered by  Hurd. The original answer, on March 7, is still visible on another  website, They Work for You.

Among  recent issues on which Atkins has played no part is the case of Alfie  Dingley, 6, from Kenilworth, Warwickshire, who has severe epilepsy. His  parents say he improved after taking cannabis oil in Holland, where it  is legal. They met Theresa May to plead for a licence allowing him to  take it in the UK. The case triggered an urgent question in parliament,  answered by Hurd.

The  cannabis grown by British Sugar is destined for a new epilepsy drug,  epidiolex, developed by the UK company GW Pharmaceuticals. It expects  clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration as early as next  month and is also in the EU licencing process. The British government’s  policy remains that raw cannabis “has no established medical or  therapeutical benefits in the UK”.

Before  she became a minister, Atkins told MPs that her husband’s crop was a  “non-psychoactive” version of cannabis, “a very different substance”  from the psychoactive version. However, it is understood that British  Sugar’s Home Office licence is an exceptionally rare “high-THC” licence,  allowing it to grow cannabis with high levels of tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC), the pyschoactive substance that intoxicates users. The Home  Office refused to deny this. High-THC licences are issued to grow  cannabis with a THC level of more than 0.2%.

Chris  Tovey, GW’s chief operating officer, said the Wissington cannabis was a  variety high in cannabidiol (CBD), which reduces pain and anxiety. The  levels of THC in it were “at or around 0.2%,” the threshold for a  high-THC licence, he said, but it was not a high-THC product.

Peter  Reynolds, president of Clear, the campaign for cannabis law reform,  said: “Victoria Atkins is in a ridiculously vulnerable position and has a  massive conflict of interest.”

The  Home Office said: “When she was appointed . . . the minister  voluntarily recused herself from policy or decisions relating to  cannabis, including licensing.”

British Sugar declined to comment.

10xwdq1,"It’s a difficult subject to speak about objectively at this late stage of conflict having broken out. And everything also looks 20/20 when viewed in hindsight.

The decision to continue arming Ukraine is a no-brainer today. But let’s not pretend it has always been a no-brainier. In 2014, the west did absolutely nothing to resist the Russian occupation of Crimea and aggression in the Donbass.

Frankly until the current conflict, most western citizens had zero knowledge about Ukraine (let alone its geopolitical relevance) nor did they have any sense of fraternal solidarity with the Ukrainian people.

There was a very long period with which better decisions from western nations (US, EU, NATO, etc) could have averted war imho. And an even longer period with which coordinated policy in the west could have made strides toward bringing Russia into the fold of the modern liberal world. Instead it has been made a pariah for decades, leaving a ruthless dictator’s iron grip to be the factor that has provided substantially improved quality of living and GDP, etc in the country.

Personally I believe there are plenty of western politicians and senior military personnel that see two former Soviet nations tearing strips out of each other without the need for a single NATO life to be put at risk. There is only benefit in keeping the conflict going for as long as possible, when viewed from this lens. 

These factors considered, providing arms to Ukraine probably was not a positive decision. But the inverse would not be to simply give up let them get invaded. It was to have taken wiser foreign policy decisions toward Ukraine and Russia much earlier.

I don't know if that means the lipton bags have 20% less tea in them, or if that number includes packaging, etc.

Anyway, yeah, a tea blend containing ""lower grade"" (grade in this instance referring to particle size, not necessarily quality) tea (i.e. more dust than fannings) will tend to brew quicker as the water will penetrate the smaller particles quicker and allow the compounds to diffuse into the water rapidly. 

Ostensibly, whole-leaf or loose broken leaf tea is ""higher quality"", yet a lot of people might find it takes longer to brew to what they would consider a suitable strength, and it might not even reach that strength at all. 

So I guess what I'm getting at is twofold; first, if you like it, I guess it doesn't matter if it's not made of fancy expensive tea. 

Secondly; if you like a more nuanced brew and want to up your game, maybe try out a loose-leaf or whole-leaf tea.

s7k9cv,"At 1:1 leverage the value of your holdings is directly tied to the relative movements of the underlying currencies. The kicker will be overnight fees, but for an unleveraged position the rate is ~0.18% per year which is like half the management fee you likely already pay on your pension, ISA funds, etc.

I think jumping the shark from this to crypto is incredibly naive. If your aim is to put money somewhere relatively stable outside of GBP then going to stablecoins rather than Forex seems unnecessary given that  those stablecoins are backed by fiat currencies to begin with - but in addition you're also taking on the ever-present risk of regulatory impact on crypto whilst still being tied to the underlying strength of the fiat currency that's collateralised by the crypto.

For novice investors I honestly think it's kind of absurd to recommend crypto, **especially** stablecoins given the returns profiles are still tied to fiat currency and all you're functionally doing different with your money in those coins is taking on unnecessary regulatory risk to save yourself a completely negligible fee. This doesn't even consider those of us that take issue with the environmental impact of crypto (inb4 'proof of stake soon!™') which makes putting cash into crypto even ickier.",2022-01-19 10:43:37

obgx2e,"I’m going to assume you’re not a troll because you seem to have put some effort into that response but you realise you’ve opened with “words words words, are you middle class by any chance?” and then you’ve gone on to write a longer response that my original post. So, if the use of excess language is a signifier of being middle class, wouldn’t that make you…

On a serious note though, the entire “you sound middle class” thing is just a lazy ad hominem, isn’t it? It’s a bit strange to try and shame a person by calling them middle class while simultaneously attempting to call them out for being classist and, as I pointed out above, you’re not the sole arbiter of class…although you do seem to be obsessed with it.

You think I’m talking about working class people, while I’m actually, heuristically, addressing a football fan who is white, male, in his late 20s to early 50s, who may well consider himself working class but probably, socioeconomically speaking, is actually more likely to be the middle class that you seem to think are my natural companions. That shouldn’t really come as any surprise because, quite apart from anything else, I think you’ll find that a large proportion of what would generally be considered the “working class” is made up of the sort economically disadvantaged groups (including a large number of first generation migrants, single parents, and the precariously employed) who are unlikely to be able to afford to go out and get tanked up in a pub beer garden where generic lager is £5.20 a pint…especially on a Tuesday night. 

So no, l’m not calling them names, I’m calling out the behaviour of large groups of men who, especially when they watch the national team of this country, behave in a fucking atrocious manner. You might want to conflate that with some sort of perceived classism but I doubt you could even provide any evidentiary basis for suggesting that the most common supporters of football are the working class. Are they? When you take into account pay disparity between genders, and the lower uptake of football amongst female viewers? What are you defining as working class exactly…In work? In work without capital? What about home ownership? What about income level? Education? I ask because the government and the vast majority of sociologists don’t know how to define working class so maybe you could give us all an insight? Is it - people who like football but also don’t use lots of words on Reddit? Fuck…that’s me out then. 🙄

Actually, most antisocial behaviour is governed by fairly sweeping and broadly written laws so, yes, it is viewed as explicitly wrong because it breaks the basic libertarian idea that you can do what you want…until it starts to detrimentally affect other people. I mean, with antisocial the clue really is in the name. 

How do you know all this? For someone who’s taken a great deal of time to come after me for making a somewhat hyperbolic and sweeping statement…you’re pretty damn certain that it’s just a small minority who believe such and such…or only a hardline group who think this other thing. How do you know? As I replied to another comment above - online racial abuse of black football players is absolutely rife, is it just two guys in a basement somewhere…or can you perhaps start to entertain the idea that maybe there are more than one or two bad apples? Large groups have consistently shown this year that they think they’re above the rules, above the law, that their tribalism trumps others safety - and as a football fan who supports one of the teams in question, I was ashamed of the behaviour(and it wasn’t just ten guys either, it was thousands and thousands). 

“Drinking excessively, so what?” is followed by “it’s not abuse, it’s someone chatting shit over Twitter when they get drunk.” 

You’re answering your own questions for me. Excessive consumption of alcohol lowers inhibitions and makes you think it’s ok to behave in a way that is actually entirely unacceptable. Then someone like you comes along and decides that the hill you want to die on is “drunk guys on Twitter lobbing abuse at a child.” Do you get the banter chart out and go “well…slut is a bit much, what about bitch…if he’d called her a bitch maybe it would have been ok…” But rather than just admitting that grown men making fun of a crying child is the behaviour of sad wankers and moving on, you’re here saying “the slut bit was…I admit…but he’s only got a few followers …and anyway, you’re middle class.”

And then…after accusing me of being uptight about a child being called a slut online, you’re having a tantrum about my user name. Who’s the pearl clutcher now? My username was an insult - it was something someone said to
me in an effort to tease me, to hurt my feelings - it didn’t, I shrugged it off and wore it as a badge of pride instead. (Although I do think Poundland is seriously inferior to Homebargains- certainly in terms of value for money! What a class traitor!) Yet again though, as I pointed out before, you’ve completely missed the fact that the “working class” people you’re using as a vehicle for unsuccessfully accusing me of being classist, cannot simultaneously be so economically disadvantaged that they shop exclusively at Poundland but can also afford to drink to excess in the same pub as me during the midweek. 

“It’s not nationalism, it’s just banter” - of course it’s nationalism you donut! The entire political discourse in this country over the last decade has been defined through the lens of where you stand on the European Union. The entire discourse is full of nationalist, dog-whistle xenophobia and anti-European nationalism. It was literally the platform of an entire political party! You don’t think that plays into the arena of sport at all? I didn’t notice the French jeering and booing the Swiss national anthem last week - do their football fans just lack the requisite amount of passion or the requisite amount of banter in comparison to ours? 

The entire latter part of your argument can be boiled down to, very simply… “you can’t be passionate about football without also behaving like a dickhead and if you don’t behave like a dickhead you’ll show your support by sitting silently in a room so if you don’t like people behaving like dickheads you should go home.” Apart from this being nonsense, because it’s perfectly possible to be passionate about something without devolving down the evolutionary pathway, why should I? Why should a football game be a place that isn’t suitable for a child, can’t be enjoyed by a family, can’t be enjoyed by a couple of mates who don’t want to drink having a coke - why do you think you and the wankers you’re defending can define the sole way that people enjoy football? Who the hell do you think you are to suggest that people should ignore the racism, the sexism, the misogyny, the aggression, the antisocial nonsense and the general unpleasantness of large portions of a crowds behaviour because you’ve decided it’s just banter and that anyone who things otherwise is a “pearlclutcher.” 

The fact you think an attack on that negative behaviour is an attack on the working class tells me that you don’t give a shit about the working class, you just want to co-opt it as a shield from criticism. My grandfather was a first generation Irish migrant who was a founder member of a working men’s club, his brother was a founder member of a branch of the communist party, my father worked until work broke him and they all managed to watch a game of football without thinking it appropriate to sing about the bombers two of them actually experienced, booing the country two of them actually fought or laughing at little girls who just wanted their team to win…and I’m bloody proud to come from that, so don’t you dare lecture me about the working class you jumped up little fuck.",2021-07-01 23:36:07

> My parents have been given

My parents have saved to go on that harry potter train in Scotland. They were going next week. It has been booked for months. They got an email yesterday afternoon to tell them that the train is cancelled and that it is fully booked until August. No ""we will try to run extra trains on other days for you"" or anything just ""tough shit"". Now here is the kicker, we live in Northern Ireland which means hotel accommodation for a week and ferry tickets costing several hundreds are now useless. And my parents will be two of many many everyday people suffering from this bullshit next week.

> given pennies in % raises and have been for many years

Perhaps this is because they don't provide the same value to the business that they once did?

> meanwhile they see me getting 4% and my cousin getting 11%

Perhaps because you provide more value to business and therefore demand higher wages to avoid loosing you to competitors?

> and wonder why they don't get them as well.

Maybe because such a wage bill would bankrupt the company? Trains have historically had a very small profit margin. I remember when p&o layed off its workers (as much of a car crash of a situation it was the way it was handled) Boris said they would work to get those affected new jobs in the industry, starmer stood up and said ""they dont want new jobs, they want their own jobs back"". This shit infuriated me because it if you gave them their jobs back then the company would continue to operate at a 100m loss yoy and its parent company would liquidate a failed company and they would lose their jobs anyway.

It's really rather simple, if you keep pushing up wages then prices increase which pushes up inflation, which causes wages to rise, which pushes up prices and further inflation.... I think you get the point. This is whats called stagflation and it brings economic growth to nothing.",2022-06-18 13:43:24
vf1on5,"> squeezing profits

Question regarding this, how do you know you are ""squeezing profits"" and not inadvertently sinking a business? How do you know that giving people a fucking 11.1% pay rise isnt actually making the business now unprofitable or only marginally profitable, which you may see as a good thing but a business with a profit margin of say 1% is unsustainable as you can currently get higher returns than that from government bonds.

> giving people more purchasing power, doesn't lead to stagflation

Yes it does. Here is a very simple example;

Step 1. Higher wages
Step 2. Businesses now need to put prices up to cover higher costs
Step 3. This is further inflation which leads to...
Step 4. Calls for higher wages

Then the cycle repeats which slows economic growth to a crawl and you have stagflation. You seem to be under this strange delusion that if you force companies to pay their workers higher wages that they will not raise their prices to compensate for the higher costs.

But ofc you will then want to use authoritarian political policies to coerce companies into operating the way you want them to. This will then leave us behind on the global economic stage as was the case when labour was in government before thatcher.

It’s then my job to present that data to the board and explain it to them in a way that is very quick and easy to understand and absorb. Then, through my own experience of building and scaling multi million dollar small businesses, I advise them on how to use this data to benefit their business. 

I pay guys like you - expert researchers, expert graphic designers, and a full on video team - to make MY clients the most money possible in their business by hiring me as a consultant. 

My knowledge is limited without your data, just as your data may be worthless to a business without my knowledge.

us5qco,"Unless you get permission to do so, picking flowers that have been deliberately planted (gardens, roundabouts, flower pots, garden centres, crops etc.) would be illegal under the 1968 Theft Act. So no, you can't just go around picking what you want.

This is the key part of the act:
“A person who picks mushrooms growing wild on any land, or who picks flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant growing wild on any land, does not (although not in possession of the land) steal what he picks, unless he does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purpose.”

Unless the plant is overhanging a public right of way then it is ok as you're not on private property, which is what the act covers. It is still common courtesy to ask if it is growing in someone's garden. Most people don't mind. 🙂

Uprooting plants without permission is illegal under 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act which includes damaging specific protected areas and species.

Our energy bills have skyrocketed, and combined with higher costs for insurances, fuel, food etc, we are really having to cut back. **That second mortgage also kills us. And nursery increased from £2200 to £2350/mo for the kiddos.**

x1dtjj,"Ok my 2 cents…. This may appear as a flex but I just want to illustrate a lower income bracket coping mechanism….
I’m a single dad with2 kids in a mortgaged 3 bed terrace. We stay within budget to spend £1400 a month (net income is £2750, but saving to FIRE). Currently mortgage is £625 and Gas and Electric are £158, car is paid for, £200 a month in food etc etc and disposable income of £150 a month after other insurances, Netflix etc. Enough saving for camping holidays etc. 

Ok with gas and electric. DD is currently £158. But found out we are using less, so currently in credit to £450. Before these price rises, OVO recommended DD reduced to £102. Even with current price rises and annual gas use of 6500kWh and Electric of 2400kWh Plus the £400 cash help we should see a DD of £157 (a pound cheaper) covering us with no change in use. 

Now with the predicted Jan and April price rises, this becomes a problem…. Worse case, the DD goes up to £305 a month for us based on kWh price rise projections, and with no usage changes. 

So what can we do? First, next year the kids will be leaving home (21yo and 18yo), or they can contribute to costs. I will spend winter 2023/24 overseas so either the kids can pay for U.K. use or the house will be put on maintenance temperature … either way gas cost will be low. Ditto for electric and we have lots of usage wiggle room. For example of the 6-7 kWh we use a day , 1.5 are my sons PC etc etc

So I figure that with some management the price rises for us will be ok. With the rest of the family contributing if living here or if it’s just me the 2/3rds reduction in use, should see little change in the overall cost.

x1dtjj,"As someone who has a long term health issue (and zero in the way of treatment because I don't seem to fit the criteria for mental health treatment for my eating disorders anymore because I dared to have an eating disorder AND be over the age of 25... apparently treatment only happens if you're ""young"" these days 😕😞 so I'm at risk as a result of my mental health issues and low weight and all the other knock on health limits perpetuated by malnutrition and daily abuse of my behaviours. (Yes I know I'm an idiot, yes I know I should be able to handle things better, yes I do feel like I've failed life in the extreme).

I am likely to be in the position where I don't turn on my heating. I understand the risks but there is no choice for me. If the money isn't there, the bailiffs will terrify me, the sense of fear will overwhelm me, and the knowledge I am trapped will add to my already depression and anxiety issues which will feel unbearable and without any help I'm faced with trying to live with all of that when I already know I can't (my depression and anxiety issues are the reason I have an eating disorder and so drive my eating disorders.) 

I'm likely to be in one of two positions. Either terrified by the debt and risk of losing all my possessions to bailiffs, or homeless or similar, or freezing cold and getting more unwell and likely to need medical care which as we all know isn't likely to be thick on the ground this winter.

I'm expecting one of those situations to knock me over and worry I won't make it to next year, either because the help I will need won't exist or by my own hand because I've talked myself into it feeling I can't carry on. I'm trying to not think about things too much, it's obvious to me that I don't have any real control or way out of any of this. As someone who is jobless (I volunteer but can't work due to my health and being at times and sadly all too unpredictably often, am forced to be bedbound because the health side too over)I don't have the savings (I do though have a maxed out overdraft....) I can't fight a bill that rises, not even that slightly. 

I am worried. But trying not to worry, because worrying is a risk to me; I worry and things get out of hand and my depression and anxiety come back and on top of the worry which gets too much and the consequences aren't great. I don't have a way out when that happens - at least not a healthy one. I have to think responsibly here and do what I can to keep going, which for me means understanding there is little I can do here, not when I'm already struggling just to afford the food I do eat! 

So in answer to the question how am I coping? I don't think I am, and at the same time I'm doing everything I can to try to ignore what I can and trying to keep going to just keep going. I know this will get to me eventually, if I'm very honest with myself, and I think all ways point too directly to a ""game over"" (If you see what I mean) and I feel powerless against that. I'm too unnecessary, too costly and too much of a waste of space for anyone from those that have any power here, to fight for me, to want to fight or to fight with good reason. I don't really want to die, not really, I'm just aware of the way my future currently looks and my weakness against stopping any of it.",2022-08-30 20:25:19

zhonbn,"Train workers probably need to take into account some comments that go against the employee and union Narrative before just voting down and blocking their ears.

There is a reason some are not so supportive of train workers compared to say the Nurses or Paramedics strike.

Easy way to see them comments is to sort by controversial, where no doubt this one will end up because fistpumpz for the unions.

Some are obviously going to be offensive as with any Reddit sub,  but don't get that confused with those outside of the railway business genuinely not feeling the love for the railway strikes or the employees, mainly because a lot of people are on less money for the same job, with no better conditions or any chance of even reaching an 8% pay rise, just to also not be able to catch a train to said shit job, with the likeliness that ticket prices will continue to increase. 

Any railway worker, sit back, away from union noise and colleagues for a moment and let that sink in before replying with an off topic remark about the whole economy and a pay cut you're taking, ***everyone*** is in that boat. Just imagine already being paid less, for worse working conditions and job prospects to be told you're not going to get anything but those in a better position are??

***That's why there's not so much public support for striking railway staff compared to other strikes, not just because people are annoyed they can't catch a train.***

TLDR- railway workers need to appreciate that they are already paid well in comparison and the conditions are not that bad. Check that green grass on the other siden if unsure.

Also don't worry, I'm not saying that because I'm trying to have a debate with you over who has it worse or which gender the police give a shit about. I became an advocate for survivors after what happened to me and I care about and campain on behalf of victims regardless of their gender.   
   
From my experience working in this sector and getting involved at a political level too, what I will say is that while it's true that male victims have a different experience to female victims and that it comes with its own unique hurdle and challenges.. It's a mistake to assume that means female victims are being taken more seriously by the police and the criminal justice system.  
   
With the way the current system is set up, I would seriously rather be raped again than ever report anither rape to the police. And every single survivor that I have worked with at a campaign level over the last four years says exactly the same thing.   
   
I really do care about male and trans survivors. I think when you've been through something like domestic or sexual violence, you tend to have far more in common with each other than you realise. You definitely don't see each other as competitors or judge anyone by the type of rape / assault they went through.

yl0uux,"Kicking myself because when we bought our current place a year ago we opted for a 2 year fix at 1.99% instead of 5 because we didn't think we'd want to stay in this area for longer than that - but we may have to if we end up in negative equity 🙌 and then we'll need to remortgage next October too. Could have been on a 2.19% fix until 2026 if we'd had the balls to lock in for that long - ffs.

Literally at the point where we decided to swap to a 2 year fix they were sending memos around for banks to prepare for negative interest rates so we thought we were making a sound decision at the time - ffs x2.

I've got an offer locked in at 4% on a 5 year fix that expires in Feb - really not sure what to do as we'd be paying through the nose to exit early for the privilege of then paying more per month, _or_ do we just go onto a tracker/SVR for a bit in the hope that we can get a sub-4% fix in 2024? All the advice seems to suggest that that rates will be back down to that level by then so would be kicking myself again (ffs x3) if I've paid all that money to remortgage and be stuck on a higher rate than necessary for 5 years.

yl0uux,">😂 no. But has it impacted goods we import from Europe? Yes. It costs more to do business here now.

It's created trade friction but has not added 30% onto the price.

>Source: work for a large auto manufacturer and saw the price jumps.

Which by and large is due to soaring global commodity prices. The cost increases of manufactured goods being imported from Europe have substantially more to do with Germany's catastrophically stupid decision to tie their industrial base to cheap Russian gas than they they have to do with extra checks between the UK and France.

>Supply side issues made worse by brexit. Not solely down to.

They have almost nothing to do with Brexit. Much like the Netherlands 14% inflation has nothing to do with Brexit.

As a woman, agreed. I've been in job interviews where they've asked what I want to be paid, I said what I wanted to be paid, and they tried various ways to negotiate me down from that. I reaffirmed that this was the value I ascribed to myself as a candidate and my current skillset, and, if they want to make use of all that, they have to pay what I think it's worth.

Still, I think it's hard to get into this mindset, given how we're socialised, and it's also harder to actually get to the point where people are willing to take you seriously and negotiate with you.

100% this, because people are so desperate to simply be employed that they willingly sell themselves short just to get the job instead of standing fast on what you believe you're worth.

y593ul,"> Are you counting abstentions as ""yes""?

I'm saying it was poor wording. I should have said ""2% voted against"" not ""98% voted for"". Or perhaps ""98% of those who voted...""  
That's not the same thing obviously, and I acknowledge that, but think you're splitting hairs to avoud my main point. 

The point remains that voting labour was voting for the side that supported the war much less than the tories.  
This idea that it was ""blairs war"" as though hes a dictator, or ""labour's war"" as though they dragged our country into a war 99% of people including all other major parties were against, isn't true, its just tory propaganda to absolve them of all responsibility, and to tie it entirely to the most left wing leader we've elected in over 40 years (as truly pathetic as that is, it's true). 

Wed have gone into Iraq if tbe tories had been in charge. Plus, this idea that ""blairs actions killed all those people"" isnt true either, America would have gone in without us with the same consequences.  

I'm not giving Blair a pass here. It's one of the most shameful actions in recent British history, we should never have been involved, and we have blood on our hands. 
I was a teenage when it happened, and was half way through my first Noam Chomsky book (that I never finished) and was astonished to see direct parallels between what he was describing and what would happen, and clearly remember saying to my dad ""they won't find any WMDs"".  
I don't think Id ever voted for Labour until Corbyn came along. 

> Why, in a democracy, do you want to ""other"" and ""punish""? 

Why in a democracy do I want people who've wrecked our country to face consequences instead of just saying ""oopsie lol 🤭""?  
Because they'll fucking do it again next time they get the chance if they don't face any consequences. If the consequences are them shutting the fuck up for a bit, good. If they're the complete destruction of the party they care about, better. If its vandalism and putting them in the stocks..... probably too far.",2022-10-16 11:54:51

#***BUT***

My sympathy for these muppets ran out the day I saw that footage of them refusing to let an emergency vehicle (an ambulance) through. I don’t wholly agree with them targeting commuters as it is - wrong people, guys - but *you don't block emergency vehicles*. People were pulling them out of the road and they were immediately going back to block it. That's my line. You are directly fucking with someone's chances of life and death there. If they *really* think annoying commuters is the way to go, fine (it's not, but 🤷‍♀️) but there is *zero* excuse for blocking an ambulance because whatever point you *think* you might be making, it's overshadowed by the fact that you have, at that point, *clearly* lost any humanity. So they have lost my - and most of my healthcare colleagues' - support until they undertake to allow emergency vehicles ie fire, ambulance, police etc through their blocks unhindered, no questions. As long as they do that, they can take their chances with the law and the public afaic and do what they think they need to do.

Absolutely, as previously mentioned, there were instances of anti semitism that should never have occurred and were addressed, sometimes not as strongly as they should have been, but there is no overwhelming anti semitism issue within the Labour Party over and above the same issues experienced within every other party.

Because that's 1% of 70m, the top 1% of the UK.

The top 1% refers to individuals, not households.

I notice now some figures only include adults, so you've got a potential range from 540k to 700k, at 540k we can still afford 350m a week for the NHS, double our welfare, but now it will take an extra year for them to pay off covid.

>But ww2

Ww2 knocked the world economy by $4 trillion inflation adjusted dollars, the imf predict covid has cost $12.5t so far.

You're right, 90% is nowhere near adequate, we need 99% taxes if we were to live with the same honour and class as our war heroes.

>We paid less before ww1

We had a very different tax and government system pre ww1, and far fewer services, we wouldn't see the NHS for another 30 years.

But even as early as 1915, the government introduced an 80% tax rate on all profits that had increased since the start of the war. Imagine if we taxed 80% of all increased profit since the first banking collapse in the 90's, that makes £350m a week look like chump change.

Corbyn at his best got only 4 more seats than Brown and Corbyn at his worst got 30 seats less than Miliband. These are facts too. Starmer will most certainly get more than the 202 seats from the last election. Current polling puts him on about 300-310 or so without campaigning.

I was met by hyperbole from anti-immigration folk last time: ‘better build over ALL the rest of it then to let in 10m refugees!’

Kinda my point: NOBODY is talking about taking in 10 million refugees but let’s use that as an example:

In the highly unlikely event we take in 10 MILLION refugees, at the existing population density, they would take up less than 0.4% of the remaining 97.5% unbuilt/unpaved land.

Even if we rounded current built on/paved land to 3%, for the existing 67m population, it would still take an influx of 22 MILLION refugees to take up another… 1% of UK land area. Again, NOBODY is talking about taking in number that high.

There is room but housing, healthcare and services have been systematically broken by this Tory government’s policies for the last TWELVE YEARS. If you support the Tories ask yourself what has actually, tangibly IMPROVED over the last twelve years beyond slogans and blaming others.

And that Genie will never go back in the bottle. It's a back door for the government to then get rid of any one they wish just because, and when you say that's not right they will just ponit to this and you will then realize you let them open that door.

Llandybie is one of those Welsh villages where people don't have surnames (obviously they do, they're all Thomas, or Edwards or Matthews, Evans or Jones), but they're known by what they do. So Dafydd who owned the dairy was Daf the Milk, Dilys who ran the corner shop (so long ago there were no Indians running corner shops) was either Corner Dil or Dilys the Shop. Then there was Mags the Pie because she made pies (obviously). She spoke ***NO ENGLISH***, her daughter, whose name I can't remember, had to translate. We used to come home with a box of at least a dozen of her fruit pies. 100% homegrown and homemade. Fruit from her back garden, pastry made from scratch. 

The woman who looked after the farm's 200+ herd of Jersey cows was known as 'Cow Pat' (yes, her name really was Patricia). Their kids ruined the place; the youngest daughter took it over and reinvented it as one of those self-catering places you'd find advertised in the Telegraph Weekend or colour supplement. The eldest daughter wanted to keep it as a working farm with additional wildlife photography/art breaks. She also had the idea of offering camping holidays for kids. Her sister completely fucked it up. Prices for a week starting at £150pp/pn, no kids' discounts (so that's £4,200 for a family of 4, fucking insane). Not even sure if it's still going (it's the Glynhir Estate, near Ammanford).

My Dad passed away from a brain tumor over 3 years and she dealt with it while also having cancer. The night of his funeral I had to fly abroad for 6 months for work. She dealt with that alone as we're a small family. I don't feel great about that last but but they both wanted me to go.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52905378

I think I saw an article talking about how the former CEO was praised turned the loss-making Post Office into a profit-making one. These kinds of BS tactics may have been used to try and recoup costs but that's my speculation only. I wonder how much in bonuses and pay does a CEO make in such a position 🤔",2021-04-25 00:39:20
mxdm7k,"Ofcourse the first comment you make is BS 🙄



>When you start properly using it, some of the problems become clear. When did 'the company' know about the problems with Horizon? 


How about reading my damn comments and links for once? Audit reports showing the company knew go as far back as 2011. The pregnant lady example i gave where even the legal team knew about the damn bugs was in 2010. 


> more tangential BS 

The pending investigations will clear up this nonsense but that still doesn't change the fact that I've cited examples where they had already known and yet the lawsuits continued

You seem to want to go into pedanticism rather than acknowledge the fact that there is documented evidence that the company knew about the bugs and still continued prosecuting. Who the first person to discover the issue is besides the point 


>When did the legal team responsible for the prosecutions become aware that the evidence they were offering to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a fraud had been committed was without doubt unreliable? When did management become aware of that?

I gave you an example sherlock. Did you even read my comments or do you expect me to repeat for your convenience?  

The post offices own security team has contacted the legal team about grave concerns that could impact future cases days before a case of a pregnant lady was due. The legal team went ahead with the lawsuit and did not disclose the evidence to her defence... 


>At what date would it be appropriate to hold that the Post Office Limited as a company - to the extent that a corporate body can be said to 'know' anything - knew that the prosecutions were unlawful?

More pedantic BS that seeks to cop out. You also made out that the company merely knew once the mass lawsuit came about. This was shown to be BS as per my links.

>It seems that it was only relative late in the entire fiasco that information to the effect that the individual subpostmaster accounts were not secure from defects and interference was definitely understood by the Post Office management.

Lawsuits were continuing past 2017. Evidence shown they knew from 2011 and earlier. Hell even the panarama investigation was in 2015. This showed constant denial for the evidence. It was hardly ""late"". That's your own nonsense view.


>In certain circumstances there arises a legal presumption under English law that if any one of the company's employees knows something, that knowledge is attributed to the company as a whole, because it is said that a company should have systems in place to ensure that such information rises through the chain of responsibility to the directors. It maybe that this would apply to the Post Office in this circumstance

Well no shit. The problem was that management and even legal teams ignored evidence.

>more fluffed BS that seems to ignore the fact that criminal investigations are currently on the way and try to deflect with pedantic questions that would otherwise be answered by the cdiminal investigations but still does not change the fact that management and legal knew of the issues despite continuing with court cases  

Both the post office and fugitsu both have been shown to have ignored the issues. Fugitsu being worse off given the systemic issues in their development process (again, i had linked this)
 This person would have to know, to a certain degree of certainty, that Horizon was producing data which was definitely incorrect such that it should not be used to support a prosecution. It would probably not be sufficient to remove 'reasonable doubt' to be able to show only that that person ought to have realised that the data on which a particular prosecution was based was incorrect, or ought to have undertaken further enquiries before continuing with or commencing a prosecution.


>It may be that the Post Office staff responsible for dealing with Horizon, raising queries with Fujitsu, may have realised that the software was incapable of providing data which could reasonably be relied on to support a criminal prosecution. But they weren't the people carrying out the prosecutions. When did they tell the legal department? When did they tell their head of department, and did he or she tell the head of the legal department, or tell someone who should have told the head of the legal department?

Again more repetitive BS that was already answered. Evidence shows as far back as 2010 that not only did the post office know but their legal team knew. 

>One of the first things I wrote on this thread is that there should be a statutory investigation into what happened, and the question to be asked of everyone is 'what did he/she know, and when did he/she know it', the question that was asked of all the participants of the Watergate cover up all those years ago.


And investigations are on the way, knowing the full details still does not change the fact that they sufficiently knew early on and chose to ignore the issues and continue on with prosecuting 

The many other things you wrote include potentially only knowing at the time of the mass lawsuit- which is BS as per my links, and that you wanted sources for when the legal team knew about the issues- which I again linked yet you seemed to have ignored only to repeat yourself again. You also posted pedantic nonsense when I was talking about fraud as if that could not possibly also apply to those who did not think it was fraud. Add on top the extra BS about how there couldnt be abuse of power despite the fact that management knowing of an issue and ignoring due diligence is exactly that...

>As it seems to have escaped a lot of redditors, I do not exclude the possibility that it will be or would be possible to issue proceedings.

It hasn't escaped anyone. The problem is you seem to think your arguments are neutral while also showing that you didn't look much into the issue. There are various articles from the BBC and ComputerWeekly that shed more light. You should have a read before posting these fluff posts 

Fact of the matter is that there is evidence that the company knew of the problems yet ignored them and continued on. You seem to be going out of your way to ignore this. Talking about how you wish the CEO would be investigated doesn't change the fact that you can't seem to comprehend just incompetence and does go into lying which is what ignoring evidence is...

Many of your stupid questions would have been answered had you read my links. You chose not to. Remaining questions would be answered through the pending investigations. You seem to think we can only know only after this completes... it doesn't. The evidence is already there. You want to post BS questions about finer details when it is already known that the company knew.... if there is evidence that the company knew in 2010 (which there is), wanting to know that an employee first noticed in 2009 doesn't change that...

Like no shit sherlock the defence is meant to try and build their case up. They don't need a fool to state the obvious. Its just not that simple 

The problem is you seem to lack the critical thinking skills to understand that this is much more complex than you seem to think it is...

Why are you assuming they have full access to the damn code? If Microsoft fucked you over do you think you can magically get the code and discover the bugs that fucked you over? If you have a lawsuit do you think you can magically request the code to analyse?

Can you comprehend that there were many court cases spanning decades? Yet you seem to stupidly think they should just try harder so they won't fail 🤦‍♂️

Care can be psychiatric treatment, therapy, giving children the ability to present outwardly as whatever they like short of clinical procedures/surgeries until they are of age to be able to make those decisions. It's not fucking difficult.  They don't tend to give 13 year old girls boob jobs despite how many girls who have body positivity issues during puberty and don't like what they've got.

However, as some who has been hospitalised because of drug withdrawal or overdose (ghb) not all the time - but quite often have been talked to or treated like utter filth.

One time I called my brother for help . A friend of mine has passed a few weeks ago and I did something extremely stupid. On the way to the hospital I had a grand mal seizure. Wants there the doctor refused to admit me and my brother overheard him calling me a pathetic junkie.  It took 6 hours and for me to have another seizure in the waiting room which made me bash my skull repeatedly to the point it was nearly fractured before I was given an ICU bed.

 This was around 3 years pre covid. the doctor actually said to my brother ""I've got a ward full of patients who need help and didnt do that to themselves. Sorry but I won't prioritize him. 

Ended up waking from a coma with a catheter in my penis and was unimaginable pain. Had the nurses pretend they couldnt hear me when I was asking for help. And overheard them slagging me off 😣

There's literally two accounts that won't budge, think they're far bigger than they are, and to top it all off, treat me like shit. So I'm basically not dealing with them any more. I don't need the figures from them. They're not willing to treat me with respect. So I'm not going to help them out. 🤷🤷 If that's how they want to run their business then that's their prerogative.

The world has moved on socially, the overton window moved while you were busy being a moron on 4chan. We no longer dislike gay people or trans people as a society.

uk6szi,"Sorry, am not being clear. 

I’m stating that advancing Rightist or Leftism based policies has a narrower appeal than moderate policy whatever the political philosophy is of the Left or Right. 

By Right-ISM I mean dysfunctional Right ideas of maintaining hierarchies of human value at all costs

By Left-ISM  I mean dysfunctional Left ideas of destroying hierarchies of human value in order to “reboot“ civilisation. 

For want of a better way of describing it. 
Kind if like the way that Islam-ism is a problem for Islam (or other). But am unsure about if polity is a pole with extremes or a horseshoe shape. 

Anyhow to describe it, dysfunctional political notions have narrow appeal, and yet the people these extreme ideas appeal to seem to make the mist noise, inversely proportional to their practical application😏


Socialism is apparently the preparation for communism, that would have electoral appeal for sure, yet to a minority.

As for the Right’s dysfunction, am unsure what that could be exactly other than worship of corporatistic captured Govt and hierachical corruption, Elitism, and suppression of social mobility, nepotism, worship of  Govt etc, massive inequality far, far beyond the universally seen Pareto distribution.

The art of successful polity is to appeal to the electorate as a whole, surely.  

The Conservatives and the pol Right in UK need to remain vigilant in regularly cleaning house of Rightism as Labour and the Left should remain vigilant to clean house regularly with Leftism.  

Both the Left and Right have complementary political tasks in civilisation. Maintain hierarchies of hinan value that are pragmatic while ensuring they do not become corrupt and stagnant.

As for revolutions we need to remember they don’t last, it eventually returns back to its origin. It revolves.

u44nh1,"I understand what you're saying but I respectfully disagree.

In my opinion, there's a big difference between leaving your children in your own house, in your own neighborhood whilst you go and put the rubbish out versus what they did.

They left their infant children alone for hours, at night, in a foreign country, in an unlocked apartment during the course of their holiday whilst they and their group of friends had a meal together. They could have used the baby sitting services at the hotel. They could have had a rota of taking turns to look after the kids. They could've eaten with their kids earlier etc. 

And has been widely reported they ate a lot further away from their children than the equivalent distance of putting the rubbish out or gardening.

This article (https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/11/madeleinemccann) says it was 50 yards.
 
It's also widely reported that Madeleine had woken up crying the night before when they weren't there and they still did it the night she disappeared. Even if she hadn't been kidnapped, her or her siblings could have fallen, had an accident or even woke up in distres, as what had happened the night before.

The perpetrator is the most at fault. 100% agree. And I'm sure the guilt and pain they feel is something unimaginable for us all. However Madeleine was taken from their apartment because they, unintentionally of course, put her in a position of vulnerability and danger. Sadly, if they hadn't done what they did, she wouldn't have been kidnapped.

The job centre have been zero help during this time, I've asked for support in regards to education/retraining, I found short 6 week courses I could breeze but they're unwilling to bankroll those. I've asked what support they can offer and they just kicked me over to a Serco initiative where the fella is just as disengaged and is clearly just running through a script filled with pretty useless information such as 'Don't get drunk before an interview' 😔

I've been casting the net pretty wide, I've not been fussy about what I'm applying for, my more recent experience is in bar management but I had been looking to pivot into tech, so I've clued myself on Python and more recently JavaScript too but unfortunately have no qualifications in it. I had some good feedback from one or two employers on the strength of my covering letters but haven't got through the screening process as I lack a degree and the've had 200+ applying who do so it's an unnecessary risk from their perspective.

I've recently completed a volunteer project for a Junior School in the area to build a tracking system for their students as they've recently switched up their assessment criteria from quantative to qualitative and they've no systems in place to manage the change.

\---

Edit: Wow this got heavy real quick... Lots of interesting, shocking, or thought-provoking replies, but wayyyy too much for me to sift through. Some personal thoughts on the major discussions:

1st, masculinity: For an IRL example, [Brock Lesnar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJvquKo7kbA) comes to mind. He was openly talking about his introversion recently, the man is the pinnicle of physicality but is comfortable talking about things like social anxiety (which loads of kids struggle with). Vulnerability goes a long way. Keanu Reeves also comes to mind, generous, collected, focused, calm and introverted yet successful and warm, although perhaps a bit of a cliche example.

For a fictional example, [Uncle Iroh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzINu0wezWU&t=7s) (sorry to link to YT haha) from Avatar is a beautiful illustration and role model to younger children for masculinity in my opinion (not the only one, or the 'best one', just one on my mind rn). I know its a kid's show, but it doesn't matter, fictional characters, stories, and parables have given children role models, heroes, and inspiration for centuries. Humility, loyalty, emotional intelligence, wisdom, strength, authenticity are the lessons Iroh lives by. Yet we are all capable of such wonderful traits because ""masculinity is not the opposite of femininity. It is the opposite of boyish immaturity."" The algorithm props up immature, loud, spoilt, narccisistic men who have no control or accountability for their actions. It has a knock on effect to the attitudes of young people who consume their content.

2nd radicalism: The algorithm thrives on radical extremism, whether left or right, and we are seeing the societal impact of having these kind of sensationalist digital echo chambers. Log off for a bit, be mindful of your own thoughts, feelings, and reactions. The world has plenty of opinions, what it is short on is compassion.

If you look at the around 40% of dating that has been increasingly colonized by dating apps, and disregard the random chance element, it's pretty bleak.

30% of long term relationships are found in the workplace, but flirting within a workplace (assuming you work in a nice enough job to interact with a healthy number of the opposite sex, which is basically unlikely in blue collar work) is typically discouraged by increasingly draconian regulations, meaning that approach is risky for all but the most practiced and skilled.

Given that matchmaking also isn't really a thing any more in modern culture (unless you're from a minority demographic that still does it), you're left with basically nothing except hoping a female friend introduces you to someone else in their social circle, which was the other around 30%. That assumes you have friends of course, which, given the loneliness epidemic, isn't even guaranteed.

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/who-declares-loneliness-a-global-public-health-concern

The realistic options for guys have basically been slashed by 60% thanks to the hyper competitive dating app market, and people are treating the people left behind like they're defective due to not being social savants in a territory that actively punishes missteps in a variety of cruel and unusual ways.

>Activists have already **unsuccessfully** attempted to have Rowling arrested under existing laws for “misgendering” after she publicly called Willoughby a male.

Rowling, who gives platforms to and offers to bankroll fascists, and engages in Holocaust denial herself, is doing the classic bigot thing of finding a minority of cases of a marginalised group behaving badly (no one is claiming that literally every trans person is a good person) and using that to paint a broad picture of the minority at large. We wouldn’t accept this for any other group: if Rowling pointed to instances of black people or Jewish people who committed crimes, and used that as evidence for the racist things that she says, we would all (hopefully) see straight through that, right? When are the people that wish to harm minorities and take away their rights ever the good guys in history?

for the record i don’t even think this should really be a police issue, but it’s disingenuous to say JK is ‘just stating facts’ etc - she’s knowingly sending her followers after trans people with smaller accounts, and the other week she openly denied that trans people were an early target in nazi germany. personally i say just let her fade into bigoted obscurity, but i appreciate that some people think otherwise.

Ffs man. I’m cis, but it’s not hard to go about my life without getting angry about what other people choose to do with their bodies. It’s also not hard to use people’s preferred pronouns even if my brain struggles to see them as that gender. Obviously nobody’s actually going to jail for misgendering someone (I mean please use your critical thinking, there would be no way to even prove it was deliberate) all that’s gonna happen if you do it deliberately is you’ll look very small minded and like you need to get a life that doesn’t revolve around lashing out at things you don’t understand. 

90% of trans people just want to exist without people even knowing they’re trans, the other 10% mainly just wants to let people know it’s okay to transition IF you experience gender dysphoria. It’s not like they’re marching around armed with hormones trying to convert every cis person. Also most of them likely wouldn’t even *want* to put someone in jail for misgendering them, they would just think “well that person was ignorant” and move on with their day. And yes theres a couple “bad” ones but you’ll find that with literally any community.

Just look at the results the “libsoftiktok” account. Bomb threats and violence against students and schools just because they don’t actively deny the existence of a minority group and try to support them.

Russia and China have national service, both of which result in younger people having survival skills, being able to fire and maintain weapons, understanding and practicing military tactics, and being of value to their communities. This also results in respect and higher earning potential. 

In contrast, British youth are complaining about being ""forced"" into learning these skills which are potentially life saving at a time when the country, and it's allies are all on alert and getting onto a war footing. 

It seems to me, that younger people can either accept that their freedoms and rights in the west come with responsibilities, including service to the country, as the youth of other allied states have, and do, or they can die at the hands of our enemies when war comes - and it does seem to be on its way.

Perhaps you can tell me how much you think China, Iran, Russia or any other adversary will care about the rights and privileges afforded to young people today, if they succeed? 

There would be no women's rights. 

There would be no gay rights. 

Oh and let's also remember that Ukrainian women are also being raped like the German women when the Soviets took hold of Berlin, so such behaviour would also be prevelant all over Europe, including in Britain.

When they were doing phone appointments I kept missing them because they kept calling my mobile (I told them time and time again when making the appointment, I didn't know where it was and to please call my house phone).

Now I like to think most practices aren't this... Erm... Disorganised, but it's certainly possible to be in a position where you miss an appointment through no fault of your own.

I think having to go back to your GP for a rereferral and waiting again (up to 70 weeks at the moment in some cases) is far more discouraging than a £10 fine.  

If anything, paying a £10 is the easier option, and would make people think it's okay to miss the appt, because hey, the hospital got their £10 right? 

I book maybe 100 appointments a day and have on average about 5-10 on the day just not show up. Of those, most have a genuine reason why. 

I just don't think giving 5 or so people a £10 fine, is going to be productive at all. Considering the effort those people have to go through to be rereferred anyway is far more of a deterrent.

https://www.politico.eu/article/humiliation-uk-kami-kwasi-kwarteng-chancellor-bank-england-halt-market-rout/

The fact that the pound has recovered somewhat since the damage the Tories did in the mini budget doesn't change the fact that they crashed it to an all-time  low of $1.03 against the dollar. Had they not done that, it might have been much higher than it is now.

When the Tories took over in 2010, the pound was worth, on average, $1.55. The Tories crashed it to an all-time low of $1.03 with the Kami-Kwasi budget, and it has since recovered somewhat (it's currently at $1.21). But go ahead and tell me how I'm financially illiterate and the Tories haven't done anything to damage the pound. 😂

https://www.macrotrends.net/2549/pound-dollar-exchange-rate-historical-chart

Explain why you think that the pound can't be relatively weak and interest rates can't be relatively high at the same time. I look forward to your reality-defying explanation on that, since it's exactly what's happened under the Tories. Interest rates were at 0.5% when they took over in 2010 and are now at 3.0%.

Crackheads started appearing and trying to open car doors, or even people's front doors. I had one jump over my fence and try to get into my home from the back and it was scary being confronted with someone like that at 3pm in the afternoon. Flytipping in the woods around the corner is just depressing. Drug dealers took out the streetlight in front of my house to give themselves cover for their selling. 

Now, we can blame the government for lots of things. 

What we can't blame the government for is the attitudes of people. If people cared more, and tried to be better, then things wouldn't be this bad. I believe the standards of behaviour in the general public have reached rock bottom now. Consideration for others is a thing of the past. Narcissism reigns supreme. 

I had two guys threaten to kill me because I dared ask them to pick up their litter they callously dropped at their feet. You can't really blame the government for that. What is the solution to this ever worsening situation? I have no idea honestly. I don't see any politicians at the national or local level capable of doing anything meaningful. I don't see the culture changing for the better.

* poprawa języka (do jakiegoś stopnia to się stało, ale sporo mniej niż bym chciał)
* Bardziej rozwojowa praca (ale teraz jakbym wrócił to też bym taką dostał)

Labour get nothing positive from supporting strikes. They get all the negatives in the press for them and the chaos. 


Labour probably also hinder the effectiveness of the strikes themselves because the government don't want to give labour a win. If they stay out of it then it de-escalates the situation, it remains low key political and it makes a successful resolution  more likely. 

The guy involved is going to be deselected in his seat and so will be looking for a job in  while so he wants his old union job back. Defying the party is a great way to do that. Furthermore labour look very weak if they can't maintain cabinet collective responsibility.",2022-07-27 20:26:42

I am married with 4 kids, 3 of them adult and to make ends meet I bought and sold stuff, played the system and bent the rules to get where I wanted to be. Nothing too illegal like drug dealing or burglary or anything like that, just minor. We lied to get on the housing association ladder, my wife pretending we were separated to get a house quicker, then after getting a house we were offered into a scheme which helps us get a mortgage and hence frees up our housing association house for somebody else, we get our mortgage and I continue to work and have a side hustle of buying and selling to pay for the mortgage until here I am today.
So I think the lesson to young people today is be smart, work smart, cheat the system, because if you don’t then you will always be kept poor and low down on the food chain.

> Cause I don't doubt at all that shitty landlords exist.

No do I. I definitely agree that bad landlords exist, but so do bad tennants.

> But I've always been confused and fascinated by the sheer volume of crappy landlords some people seem to go through.

This is what i mean, like attracts like and all that. The issue is there is a rather nasty positive feedback loop there where if you have a bad experience the first time it will limit who will rent to you next and so on and so on. A bit like getting into bad credit/having a shitty credit score, that shit rolls downhill and just gets worse over time. Sadly i don't hold the answers to either of those things.

As for luck, people tend to make their own luck. You need to remember that all the people complaining about shitty landlords are telling you one side of the story. If you were to ask their landlords about them as tennants, what sort of stories do you think you would get?

yql38i,Not sure you've understood my comment 🤷 what I'm saying is everyone knows the pay so not sure how you can then moan your not happy with the pay. Its like taking a minimum wage job then complaining when you get ypur first payslip that your not on £35k,2022-11-09 18:58:41
yql38i,"Understood your comment perfectly, thanks.

Most people go into nursing or medicine for reasons other than money, but we should be paid a fair wage for the highly stressful work we do. My point is, if you tell everyone in medicine and nursing who isn’t happy with the pay they’re receiving and doesn’t think it fairly represents the work, that they shouldn’t have gone into the job in the first place, soon enough lots of them will leave the career entirely or go and work abroad (which is already happening) and people will stop going to train in the field in the first place and pick other things to study at university which will put them on a path to a better remunerated, less stressful life. And then you’ll have no doctors and nurses left and you’ll be complaining that you literally can’t get any medical care anywhere because there aren’t any doctors or nurses to staff any medical departments anywhere in the country, or more likely the whole system will collapse and be replaced by a private system and you’ll be complaining because you’re suddenly paying huge amounts of money for your healthcare.

Telling public sector workers who are striking that they knew what they were getting themselves into and shouldn’t have gone into the profession in the first place, so they shouldn’t fight for better conditions in their job, will lead to you not having any public services left.

The difference is in how much influence the powers that be have in shaping negative attitudes and outcomes in any given place. In England, we are held hostage by a hostile right wing media, in bed with an anachronistic neo-aristocracy, where money (along with 'knowing the right people / going to the right private schools') is power, and they convince the populace to vote against their own interests, by doubling down on the media propaganda, defunding education, and setting up scapegoats like the EU and migrants etc.

Don't get mad at your English cousins and comrades for not having the good fortune to be born in Scotland, or somewhere else where they would be inculcated with different views - get mad at the political systems that screw us all over, and pit us against one another, in their own interests!

8xosx2,"Politicians lie..........this is not a surprise 😉 Everyone expects them to lie and are surprised if they don't.

Stupid people have a vote ( I am including all sides here ).......it's the best system we have and to even think about some kind of qualification system to stop them voting takes us down a path we don't want to go.

This whole situation is way more complicated and has more levels of than people acknowledge.

I am an older person ( 52 ) - I want a world that is better for my kids........one where they don't have to sell their soul for an education or to find somewhere to live.

Globalisation is the evil underlying the modern problem and specifically with the EU - why train people when you can import them already trained, why build more houses when you can let more people in than the housing stock can manage and give the property owners a nice investment income. Unmanaged unskilled migration has pushed wages and opportunities down whilst living costs have gone up..........social mobility in the majority of the UK ( excluding the remain voting areas.........maybe you'll see a link.....) has been massively lowered.......if you are born poor you are more likely to stay poor. Globalisation and numerous governments have screwed over the working class, just look at the voting map and you will see a clear correlation.

Fuck people over, reduce their job opportunities ( and even worse their kids opportunities ), export the jobs they did have and replace them with minimum wage crap jobs that they now have to compete with huge numbers of people attracted by the open door policy .........perfect recipe for what we have now. 

The problem us that the people in the high social mobility areas that have benefitted greatly under the current system have little comprehension of what the effects are elsewhere and the resulting issues.

Globalisation and the EU go hand in hand.

That is why I voted Brexit......and will do again and again.

Sovereignty is everything - remaining in the EU would continue the current shit situation. Regaining sovereignty does not solve the problem straight away but does give us the possibility to address the problem.

There should not be any kind of tax or license fee applied to TV or internet use. Their consumption should be a right

You can literally sit down, and watch YouTube, search:  ""learn how to program in python"" and have it explained to you like you're 5 years old, with content ranging from simple 'Hello World.' to advanced data analysis.  It's all there, just a click away from you at any point 

The material is out there.  For the lowly cost of whatever your internet bill is.  And if you can't afford that?  There's public WiFi everywhere 

And if you can't afford that?  Well, you sure as shit can't afford a TV licence fee either.  AND you can just head down to the local library and use their computers and their materials.

The most you can say is a lot are uninformed and a good chunk lean right.

Saying “far right” is horse shit.

I can't imagine them putting a standby payment up for call out (which obligates you to have the phone on). 

But they've not figured out how to call you without using a withheld number yet so pretty easy to dodge any police calls here. 😉",2022-09-04 19:09:56
