77fow0,"Here's a Wall'o'Text I've been building of the definition of Net Neutrality, which may be enlightening as to your question.

---


""Net Neutrality"" or Network Neutrality is a set of democratic, egalitarian guiding ***Principles***, created and refined organically over the last 30+ years by ""Netizens"" (I.E; **anyone** actively participating in the Internet community).

These ***principles*** encompass *not only* the three ISP-centric ""Bright-Line Rules"" given tooth in law by the FCC's ""Open Internet Order"" but many, many others.

Traditionally, the most forthright Net Neutrality Principles have been along the lines of,

* **Thou shalt not block or limit Access Devices —**  A network operator (ISP) may not block or limit what device an end-user may choose to use to connect to the Internet via the ISP's network (like a brand or type of modem, router, etc). Even if the end-user cooks up their own device from scratch in their dorm room or garage (See: Steve Wozniak), as long as it follows relevant Industry Standards and Protocols and it *does not harm the network,* the ISP cannot interfere. So, if you think you have the chops to build a better, more capable DOCSIS 3.1/DSL/ISDN/Satellite transceiver device, well, by all means, GO FOR IT!
* **Thou shalt not block or limit networked devices —** A network operator (ISP) may not block or limit what device an end-user may choose to use to connect to the Internet *via their Access Device*. This means they cannot limit or block your use of Computers, TVs, Gaming systems (XBox, Playstation, etc), ""Internet of Things"" devices like a fridge or coffee pot, IP-based vibrator, VR-Group-Sexerator or anything else imagined and unimagined.
* **Thou shalt route ""Best Effort"" —** An ISP or network operator should route traffic on a ""Best Effort"" basis without prejudice or undue favoritism towards certain types of traffic (***especially for a consideration or renumeration from others***). This does not exclude Industry Standard network management and Quality of Service  practices and procedures. It means **DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE, COMCAST**. Get ALL the data where it needs to go as quickly and efficiently as possible.
* **Thou shalt not block or limit protocols** — An ISP may NOT tell you that you cannot run BitTorrent; or mine BitCoin; or run a WWW server; or a (v)Blog; or a music streaming server, so that you can access your Polka collection from remote; or run your own customized email server; or a gaming server; or host your security cameras/BabyCam so that grandma in Cincinnati can watch her little darling; or maybe host **The Next Big Thing™** you dreamed up while masturbating in the shower.
* **Thou shalt not block or limit services** — An ISP may NOT limit what services you may host or access on your Internet connection. Like Twitter or Facebook, when your government has gone to shit. Or Netflix, because your ISP has arbitrarily decided it has become extremely popular and they want to get their money-grubbing hands in on the action. Or stop you from becoming a Tor node, etc, etc.

The FCC's Bright-line Rules address a number of these principles,

* No Blocking: broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.
* No Throttling: broadband providers may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.
* No Paid Prioritization: broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration – in other words, no “fast lanes.”  This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates.

---
Those are the main ISP-centric Net Neutrality Principles. There are many more. For example, there are guidelines for ***Service*** providers, like Netflix, Google, Reddit, you-name-it. Such as,

Thou shalt not block or limit speech  
Thou shalt not block or limit based upon race, religion, creed, etc, etc.

> According to industry metrics, private investment in the internet has exceeded $1.5 trillion since 1996

Fuck off Thom Tillis

- Tax payers have pretty much subsidized every inch of their networks. It's called the Universal Service Fund/Communications Act of 1934/America fund. [On October 27, 2011, the FCC approved a six-year transfer process that would transition money from the Universal Service Fund High-Cost Program to a new $4.5 billion a year America Fund for broadband Internet expansion, effectively putting an end to the USF High-Cost Fund by 2018.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund)

- Our tax money has funded ISPs and instead of building a network, they just pocketed the money. [By the end of 2014, America will have been charged about $400 billion by the local phone incumbents, Verizon, AT&T and CenturyLink, for a fiber optic future that never showed up.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/the-book-of-broken-promis_b_5839394.html)

---

> This essentially imposes a one-size-fits-all business model on the internet and represents an unprecedented government power grab to control and regulate the internet.

Fuck off Thom Tillis

It forces ISPs to treat all data equally. Because ISPs are slimey motherfuckers that stole $400 billion without actually providing services, they should indeed be regulated with actual consequences and accountability.

So they are now allowed to choose the data they prioritize. Now companies have to pay bribes to ISPs to get their data transferred at actual speeds and not throttled.

So a start-up that has a Netflix-killer video service are not able to actually compete because Netflix has the funds to pay the bribes. AT&T can accept the bribe and artificially throttle Netflix-killer and prioritize Netflix due to bribe money.

Even worse is if AT&T has a video service and they throttle Netflix to make it seem like Netflix is inferior to their service offerings.

---

If anyone made it this far, I might as well add that `Restoring Internet Freedom Act` had nothing to do with actual internet freedom (surprise!). [The plan is to forbid the FCC from even being able to declare internet service providers (ISPs) as Title II common carriers.](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2017/05/9-senators-proposed-bill-kill-net-neutrality-called-restoring-internet-freedom-act/) They also wrote legislation that stripped FCC online privacy protections away using the Congressional Review Act.

---

I'm not really sure how we got to this point. Elected officials blatantly lying to the public and openly accepting bribes and writing legislation that benefits bribers.

It's pathetic that majority of these fuckers that are attempting to strip away privacy, limiting competition and actual freedom have R's as an affiliation.

h0l06d,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rage Against the Machine. Their political message is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of graduate level sociology and political studies most of the message will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Zack de la Rocha's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his music- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the Voynich manuscript, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realise that they're not just a cute jingle- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike RATM truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the strong anti-establishment message in Fuck the Police:

""Here's something nice and friendly
Here's something nice and friendly
Here's something nice and friendly
And it goes something like this""

Cobain was very much aware that many people would not get the point of his songs and simply sing along with them blindly. On this song, he wrote a very sing-a-long chorus so that people would find themselves singing but not understanding the song: “He’s the one who likes all the pretty songs, and he likes to sing along, but he knows not what it means.”

📷

“Likes to shoot his gun” is probably a reference to the type of people that Cobain hated the most: thoughtless macho guys with guns who lack a deeper artistic interest in the music. As the band grew more popular, these facetious people like started to come to their shows and he hated it. Cobain doesn’t mean that they’re about to shoot at him or anything, just that recklessly shooting guns is the type of thoughtless, testosterone-driven activity that these men do for enjoyment. They’re into the grunge scene just for the thrill of it, and as an excuse to go crazy and raise hell. Rock is very macho, but that’s not why Kurt was into it.

I just gasped, my mouth hung open, and for a split second I couldn't remember how to change gears- ""Look at how calm they are"" I was watching all the other cars driving past me in slow motion. 
I fumbled around on my dash for my usb, shoved it into the music player of my car so hard I nearly snapped it.
I found *this* song within 4 seconds, cranked it up as loud as my car speakers would take it and I burst into the ugliest, heart broken crying I've heard come out of my mouth since I was listening to LP when I was a fucken kid and I couldn't get rid of enough of my skin to stop my head from screaming at me.
I bawled into my steering wheel holding my hand over my mouth the whole way home.

Meteora was the first CD I bought with my own money.
It was also the first thing I *went-up-to-the-counter-and-paid-for* without my mum even though I was 11 or 12 because I was (and still am) painfully shy and get embarrassed about talking to people I don't know. I still have the Sanity receipt for it stapled into one of my diaries that I used to write in every day. 

Live in Texas was going to be released the same year and I was ITCHING to have it, I begged and begged my mum, she bought it for me and said I could have it at Christmas- I'm nearly certain that that was THE longest month of summer I've ever had to endure; luckily for me though, there was someone on my street who was ""allowed"" to listen to it immediately. I remember, because I could hear it from inside their house, floating up to my bedroom balcony. I would sit outside on that bloody balcony, straining my ears, trying to listen to it with whoever that amazing person was.
That's the only real waiting-for-something excitement I can remember from my childhood, I must have watched that DVD a million times. 
I had *the* biggest crush on Chester. 

Because Linkin Park was my first proper band that I listened to, I needed to get all their music and put it somehwere.
I'll never forget, I had this dark blue, denim CD case that I would haul around with me everywhere, it unfortunately got stolen while I was at school but it was FAT by the end of my time with it. I ended up with so many CD's; Linkin Park, Marilyn Manson and Disturbed were my favourites but Linkin Park arrived first so they were like my favourite pair of pyjamas. I knew every word, every beat, every note, they kept me comfy always.
Me, my discman and my CD'S went everywhere. Endless train travels, plane trips,  car rides.

LP and Chester's words were there through my years and years of self harm, some of the lonliest hours of my life, my parents divorce, the court cases and all the other shit I don't want to think about. 
I don't really know how to put into words how much this band helped form me, I was so young and I had all this horrible shit going through my head, I had no one to talk to and it was so soothing to know that there was someone else out there, whom I'd never met, who came from a completely different place in the world to me on all fronts, that felt the same way I did.
What I took from Chester and the rest of the band at the time was that it's alright to have, and feel emotions.
Tapping into my feelings started me writing and drawing darker and stranger things to get them out of my head rather than trying to keep them in and pretend they weren't there. Unfortunately, I'd already started the self harm, but it stopped it from escalating until much later down the line. So, I'm thankful for that too.

Its funny, after I moved away from home, I went on a kind of music hiatus. I listened to a bit, tried to find some new stuff that worked for me- I kinda did? but definitely didn't at the same time. You know, even in the car, just silence- I'm still doing that.

About 3 months ago, *this* song was on the radio at work, I didn't mind it- also didn't know who it was. I used to hum the chorus because I didn't know the words, not really paying attention.
It was soon pointed out to me by my now-boyfriend that it was actually Linkin Park- it pains me now to say but I was horrified, I hadn't actively listened to them since Minutes after Midnight and didn't realise they'd just kept changing their sound (it should have been evident, really, my man made a really good point) so I figured
""They were mine once, they can be again, I just gotta give it a chance.""

In the foreground, these last few months my world flipped upside down and I felt myself sliding down an all-too-familiar slope.
Suicidal thoughts crept back in after an extended absence, and I was listening to ""Heavy"" on repeat.

There's a moment in time that gets me about a month and a half ago I reckon. For me it was surreal:
There I was, sitting on a mattress, earphones in, rocking side to side, tears rolling down my face, filling up my head with Chester's voice, trying my best to block out the fucked thoughts that were running through my head faster than I could catch them. I was 12 again at 26. 
The words in this song were exactly the same as mine in my head- just like they used to be; Just slower, more defined and less frightful to listen to.
Chester's still got it! Even after all this time, we still think the same.
""I don't like my mind right now, stacking up problems that are so unnecessary, wish that I could slow things down, I want to let go but there's comfort in the panic. I. Drive. Myself. Crazy. Thinking everything's about me.""
""I'm holding on. Why is everything so heavy?
I'm holding on. There's so much more than I can carry. I keep dragging around what's bringing me down IF I JUST LET GO ILL BE SET FREE...""
That's all I wanted to do, let go. But I didn't.
He helped me out again. 
I've started listening to their old stuff again since I went backwards the other month, I found my replacement (since that denim case got stolen) cd's last week and put them out for all to see on my bookshelf. 
I got stuck looking at the album artwork too, the one from Meteora is ruined so I couldn't with that, but the fact that I still have it makes me so happy..

While I was driving home today after I found out, I was crying because this person who gave so much of himself to the world, who helped so many of us through our darkest days, couldnt climb out of that pit with us.

I'll always be so thankful that he turned up in my ears when he did.
My imaginary connection I've had with him my whole life will no longer surface sporadically and I feel like I've lost a bit of my heart.

Imo that's one of the best ways to keep your employees happy, promote from within, and not hire some random person to manage people in a company that could be wildly different from their last.

Keeping the same employees for as long as possible just allows your company to be more productive in the long run, I like the mentality at my company.

Only complaint is I can't work from home without good reason, but ""good reason"" can be something as simple as ""I have too many errands to get done with my commute that day"", and you'll usually get the OK, but saying ""I just prefer working from home"" is pretty frowned upon, from experience 😅",2022-02-09 20:44:54

Neil in particular stood out to me as incredible just for how he kind of got on with it. One of those musicians where there's no fuss, no extravagance, and yet the end result is brilliance. I'd compare him to John Entwistle for how they took an instrument and crafted it to make it their own without a song and dance about it.

We've lost the best today.

I witnessed an educational session where the opening act taught a bunch of euro teens what rock is. the first song or two they didn't quite get it, but by the end of the set the legend lived.

then Jovi comes on, the first hundred rows of diehard VB fans leave, and the show kicks off. I'm in the wings, looking on. suddenly there's Eddie, nudging me, pointing at John and goes ""look at that guy. what a guy. works his ass off.""

turns on his heels and walks away. I knew that moment that I've found the job I'll keep doing until I drop dead.

j6btdn,This is July of 1984 in Dallas Texas at the old Texas stadium which has since been demolished. Van Halen had a three-night stand at Reunion arena and the Jackson show I believe started early enough that allowed him to do these licks and then head over to his show or the dates were close enough that they were both in Dallas... I got to see Van Halen on that third night which was the second time I had seen them...EVH was amazing as always.. the King is dead... long live the King 👑,2020-10-07 01:58:57
j6btdn,"As I mentioned in an earlier post, I have almost the opposite feeling. While I respect EVH's contribution the modem guitar (as an innovator I'd put him on a level with Hendrix) I enjoyed their song compositions more than his playing alone. Possibly because I felt that I could never achieve his level of skill. I just enjoyed the fact that I could listen to and enjoy their music as a 'song' in and of itself without critiquing the individual parts, which I find hard to do sometimes as a musician. 

Also, LOL to your last statement 😆",2020-10-07 06:12:50
j6btdn,Same here.  I always hoped they'd bury the hatchet & do a massive tour with both Sammy & Dave.  Trade off songs or do some kind of co-headlining deal where the singers would swap nights closing the show.  And now it's never gonna happen. 😭😭😭,2020-10-07 13:01:19

Additionally, these jets are made more affordable by renting them out like a (very expensive) *air*bnb. What this article calculated is the annual emissions of a private jet that's flying every other day.

Aviation in general is a huge source of emissions. [According to Vox](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/25/8881364/greta-thunberg-climate-change-flying-airline), a one way transatlantic flight is about a ton of co2 *per passenger* and I don't think that includes the 2.7x multiplier the Swift article includes. There are 250 transatlantic flights per day and the seating capacity range is from about 250 passengers to 380 per. Just taking middle of the road figures, that's about 200,000 tons of co2 on transatlantic flights every day. No value judgment, just context.

Do you think rock n roll has become stale within the past decade? I personally think so, but I’m also 17 so my knowledge is not vast

Let me know, your thoughts mean a lot to me!

f9duxz,"Hello Ozzy!!
I hope you feel better real soon. 😎💐👊

Thank you for the new amazing album! It’s awesome!

I have two questions if that’s cool.

First, I was wondering if there was any way to see some of your recent artwork? I have always loved your pictures and doodles. There awesome!

And second, I heard that you’re thinking of getting back into the studio again very soon to possibly do a followup album. Since you won’t be going out on Tour for a little bit, would you consider doing a live online concert? (I’m not asking to be a part of it, just suggesting the idea.) Something very simple like just running through your “No More Tours 2” set in the comfort of your private rehearsal space, with only the guys, and sharing it live with all of us. You could even break it up into parts with fun intermissions. I think you would have a blast and your fans would get to see you live. Just a thought.

Love you Ozzy!
Thank you for all the great music and memories! Get well soon. 💐💕",2020-02-25 17:54:26

If there's one thing I can be proud of OU for it's recognizing this and hiring Gallogly to cut the fat.

Previous Dean of Diversity and office or whatever its name was is still throwing a fit about how its firing was discriminatory and Gallogly's just sitting in chair with Excel docs everywhere, staring at them with wild dead eyes, just saying ""really?"" with his facial expression.

Full disclosure his funding decisions have also directly and indirectly affected my educational opportunities as well but I'm frankly doing great and think he's aiming in the right direction with most cuts if he may be off target with some. And then also the apparently yearly incidents which everybody who isn't affected acts like they never happened but I don't wanna talk about that, here or either👀",2019-03-25 20:20:07
b5d4tj,It's almost as if this is a systemic issue 🤔,2019-03-25 20:11:34
b5d4tj,"I did look and none of those are actual simulations , the closest was Alaska which funnily enough requires you to literally strike oil to fund it for an extended period of time. The others were research and development projects which again have a shelf life because obviously they ran out of money - big surprise.

The actual implementation of UBI requires taxation to fund which in most recent pushes is in the form of VAT. Since you didn’t address this in your reply I assume you don’t know what it is. It stands for Value Added Tax, it is essentially the exact same as Sales tax you pay in the US but not a replacement, it’s in addition to sales tax. This means if implemented all goods and services will immediately cost 20% more than they presently do. That means increasing CPI value which measures inflation.

In addition since thankfully the US is not a communist country you have private industry and private land ownership. Landlords are an example of this and since poorer people don’t own land and have to pay rent, the landlords will naturally raise rent to match inflation due to 20% increase. You can’t hate on landlords for this because their cost of living goes up too due to VAT.

That $1000 dollar stipend becomes pretty pointless when there’s a high chance you’ll be spending more on cost of living due to the need to fund the stipend in the first place. Don’t forget about the administration cost of collecting  the tax and distributing it to every single person in the country 😉 it’s not a self sustaining model and I see it as a pointless exercise. Social Welfare was created to help the poor and it’s been working pretty well in western civilization considering the quality of life differences observed now vs 100 years ago. 

I’m a product of social welfare by the way and UBI to me represents authoritarian policy masquerading as a solution to job deprecation and income inequality when job deprecation has been ever present across history and income inequality will never be solved due to the Pareto Principle of human productivity. Free market capitalism is the best solution we have until our technology advancements completely remove the need for any economic system rendering conversations like these also pointless 🙂 I look forward to that day.",2019-03-26 02:12:30

There’s been the fanclub sales on Tuesday - of which I’m part of and bagged tickets to avoid this scenario. 

Then there was O2 priority the following days after - Barely advertised at all, I only found out through chance 

Amazon Tickets - this is a thing now?! 

The O2 system itself essentially gobbles up certain seats for VIP members to buy 

And then the official public sale, which in the grand scheme of things is basically a “buy what’s left” scenario 

Oh, and the ticket selling sites also own the scalpel sites too sooo... 👀

Buying tickets nowadays is a joke to be honest. ",2017-12-08 17:30:03

8dpb6y,"I'm so distraught.

Even though this is unconventional, Avicii got me through one of the toughest times in my life. When I was 20, I was contemplating ending my life. During this time, I was also working as a gogo dancer, and for Halloween that year, I got booked to perform at his show! Even though this wasn't a permanent fix for my depression, it did give me a chance to ""put off my death until I could dance for Avicii"".

Leading up to the show, I kept the promise to myself, and I think it saved my life. Because after the show, somehow, I found the strength to get help. 

Thanks for letting me part with you, Avicii! You had an incredible impact on my life. ♥️ 

Edit: idk if that was inappropriate to post, but I just wanted to share how he made a positive impact on my life. Not a lot of big artists allow performers on stage, but he was elated to have us as dancers!",2018-04-20 21:44:33

8wlg8j,"I'm glad you mentioned this. 
They're messing with him because he is talking to much. There has been numerous references to how jacked up the entertainment industry is because of the Illuminati and the rituals they have to perform to stay relevant. 
If you go back to when he apparently ""assaulted"" her, she was in the beginning of her career. She was know, but not insanely popular like she is now. Ever notice how these celebs ALWAYS have someone close to them pass? It's because once they hit that 20million mark they have to off someone close to them. 
Kayne killed his mom
Eminem killed his best friend ""Proof""
Adrian Peterson killed his son
Dam Dash offed Ayliah
RJ killed Whitney
Mary Kate Olsen killed Heath Ledger
Jennifer Hudson took out her ENTIRE family. 
I could go on for days. 
The people at the top of these record labels, also own the mainstream media news channels AND most of the tabloids/newspapers. If not, they are definitely intertwined with those who do.  Which is exactly why no one gets in trouble. They have the money and the power to cover these crimes up. These are ""blood sacrifices"". 
Rihanna however did NOT want to kill Chris because she genuinely loved him. She was given the opportunity to ""shame"" him. That's why these allegations of him beating her came along and it was a crock of shit. She ruined his career and his name and sadly, him. He lost his motivation and his mind. These people are EVIL. 
I bet you $100 that if I run through his social media accounts, I'll find something he has recently said that threw the elites under the bus again and that's exactly why these new charges have suddenly come up. It's fucked up. 

Oh! Let me also mention they did this same thing with Dave Chapelle. He refused to sign off on his new contract and they were PISSED. 
They told him that they would ruin his career by the time he gets home that day day. Lo and behold, by the time he touches down on Ohio, his reputation was destroyed with allegations of him being a crack head.

Remember this next time you see something crazy about someone. It likely bullshit to put them back in place. Basically saying, ""do what I say or I'll tank you"".  9/10 it works. If it doesn't, they kill them. (Think Michael Jackson and Prince😉 )

He then catches the 🐸 and puts it into a cool pot of water where it swims around happily. The frog swims around happily until it is eventually boiled to death as the water heats up. He doesn't jump because the temperature increases gradually. Paralleling how humans will tend to ignore and endure stuff because they are getting fucked over gradually.

That proves nothing about women in general, just that a millionaire famous rapper probably has had some sex. Oh wow, so surprising! 

I'm certain that lots of people who don't disrespect women also get laid a bunch. But that doesn't fit your narrative. 

There are also literally billions of women who have not slept with Eminem so you haven't proved anything about the generalization that you made.. like at all. 

> But don't worry, your socially engineered perception tells you everything you should think about women, so you know how to be a polite little boy so mommy can approve of your behaviour.

Tickets were like $65. Ouch. For both of us to go plus the hotel we would be spending over $200, plus a missed day of work and food costs. We don’t have a lot to spare but I wanted to go so badly that we finally gave in and I got to the final checkout screen for the tickets, where the fees are added. I expected maybe $30 each, which was also ridiculous, but I planned for.

The fees for both our tickets were $120. Literally doubled the cost.

There was no way we could afford that so we couldn’t go 😢

And even Arizona can drop significantly at night. Whereas Florida will just slow bake from early March to early November, 24/7.

Tangent alert: I know a lot of people find heavy metal low brow and low class, but Randy is 💯 badass. He could’ve easily hid behind his US citizenship but chose to ‘face the music’, sit in a foreign jail until he was allowed to post bail. He also expressed sincere regret to the family for their loss and proved his innocence.

tofiar,"I never got to meet you. I never knew you as a friend. But damnit, I felt like I did. 

I listened to every record you recorded, and the first thing I always heard, were your drums. And every single time, I hoped one day I could be as good as you. As solid as you. As energetic as you. Every interview I could find, I watched, hoping I could find that one nugget to make me better. Every cymbal I broke was from trying to emulate your power. Every rim shot was from trying to nail one of your fills.

You made me a better drummer...you made me laugh, (and drummers are never the funny ones in the band)...you showed me that you don't need fancy backing tracks and all stuff to be amazing. You just needed a guitar, bass and drums... and maybe a cowbell

I think my Dad gave me There Is Nothing Left To lose, and from the moment I heard that first track, stacked actors...it was over. I knew what real rock was again. You brought to my generation what we never got to experience from the hey day of Zeppelin and The Who. It was pure rock n roll. Something that I judge every other band by today... ""can these guys play for 3hrs without all this technology...nope"" 

But you did...and damnit you did it so well. With a smile and a laugh that made everyone want to be around you to boot. I hoped to one day express how you've impacted me, and talk shop, but I can only take what you're given me and put it to use as often as I can.

I've been lucky enough to see you play live a few times...and this last time couldn't have been any more special. Me and 700 other crazy people, standing in a tiny club in the middle of covid...I hope you knew how much you impacted everyone that night, and how much we all needed that...

I read something that said you were the only person that could play drums behind Dave, and not wish Dave was playing instead. And it couldn't be more true...

Thank you for being such a huge part of my musical journey. I don't think it will ever be the same again...

He played in marching band with a Qtip on his head. He worked at guitar center on El Toro Road,  whatever it took. He never stopped playing with a passion and 🔥.
I will always point to him as a dreamer who made it happen, he was always smiling , kind, and genuine to all, and always remembered his friends and his roots.

I’ve watched TH’s master classes over and over and his enthusiasm, humility, gratitude, his boundless energy, and of course all his music with Foo Fighters will *always* be an inspiration. RIP.

I also met him randomly in my home town when he asked me for directions on his bike 😓

Been a Foo fan for a LONG time. I see many talking about them performing covers & that was a staple of their live shows. They perform a LOT of classic rock covers & jam sessions & their shows are simply mind blowing. I’ve been to a lot of live shows & not one of them can compare. 

I saw them @ Wells Fargo Center in [Philly](https://i.imgur.com/GykHZV3.jpg) on the Wasting Light tour with some relatives that aren’t around anymore. I’ll be forever grateful for them experiences & all of their music they’ve given us the last 20 years. 

Life is funny. If you don’t laugh, you’re in trouble.

tofiar,"A very sad day… I had the pleasure of meeting him in the summer of 2020. He stood on the beach holding his surfboard (you can imagine that, right?) and we talked for at least five minutes about his old neighborhood, kids, where he was living. What an awesome human being who let someone he’d never met spend a few minutes just chewing the fat. We’re always too young to go, but I believe he has three fairly young kids that will grow up without him. Peace, brother. 🤙🏼

tofiar,"I honestly don’t think it was an OD, or people should speak so soon that it is. The Daily Mail reported some weird stuff, but they aren’t reliable. I can believe he had some friends over, and some drinks. Plus he’s a drummer that played fucking hard. 50 is very young, but dude was playing drums non stop on top of his issues 20 years ago. I don’t think his past should be held against him here. People change and he def did, and was open about it.

Honestly, I think it was just a weak heart and prior medical conditions. Whether he was born like that, or his early years primed him for an early heart attack. He was 50 and I honestly think it was a heart attack, that could of just been worsen from a long time ago. I’m 39, and I’ve had many friends by 40-45 die, that got clean a decade or two before, but ended up having a fatal heart attack. 

But my father was a heavy drinker, 3 heart attacks in his life and still relapses…he’s fucking 73, and kicking. Just got out of rehab again 2 weeks ago. You just don’t know man, but I don’t think he went wild before a show and did that. If anything seem like he had a few drinks with friends, and was getting ready to buss in for the show. Then it just happened suddenly. I’m still pretty shocked honestly. I do feel bad for all the family and band…But man Pat must feel horrible. Every band he’s been in, he’s had to deal with this too soon. I only saw them in 1996 before Taylor joined. He def changed that band for the better! RIP 🙏

Edit: I’m just seeing the report come in of 10 different substances. That’s sad, but it’s not an OD per say still. I’m prescribed opiates, benzos for 10 years and was on other anti depressants. Also I do have a few drinks here and there. We don’t know if these meds were illegal substances, or drugs he was prescribed for medical reasons. It’s still sad, but seeing the downvotes…I scrolls back and saw the news. I still hold off judgment till they officially release cause of death. I could die tomorrow, and I’d have 5 different meds in my body that are benzo and opiates prescribed for anxiety and substitute meds like subutex for past addiction. Still doesn’t mean it was caused by those legally prescribed meds. Could of been prescribed meds he took for years for addiction. Those in the program know they prescribe these meds that help addicts, and majority do not just drop dead.",2022-03-26 22:05:24
tofiar,"I booked RHCP tickets this week, and I was on the phone to my brother this morning and was saying how all my favourite bands are turning 50+, even Blink (Mark obviously had cancer recently), Eminem etc so I want to see them ASAP... just in case.

About 20 mins later, by sheer coincidence I was listening to the Dave Grohl episode of Happy Place (podcast) and sat down to check Whatsapp.

My friend sent me a link to a new article. I read it. Then read it again.

My first thought was ""I don't get the joke, is it a meme?""

So I clicked the link. Honestly, it just immediately brought me back to 2017 when I found out Chester died.

Pretty much just sat there saying ""No. No."" over and over again. This can't be real, can it? 

Like many stories here, I had tickets to see the Foos for the first time in 2020 at Novarock but it got cancelled due to COVID. I was going to buy tickets soon to see them this summer, and I was so excited.

I guess that might never happen now.

See your favourite bands/artists whilst you can. Tomorrow is not promised to anyone.

They were strolling through the town when, if the rumors are true, they heard this GarageBand.
Knocked on the door ; Hey guys we're Foo Fighters.
We love your skills/sound. Wanna open for us tomorrow ?
And such started the adventure of Nilfisk(yes, they were named after a vaccum cleaner), albeit a short adventure, but these are the kind of stories I've heard about the band. Just genuinely nice guys.

I think they cancelled when they were about to play according to this tweet (Translated by me):  

>> ATTENTION 🚨 Foo Fighter's drummer, Taylor Hawkins, has died in Bogotá ► 

>> The band was in the city in order to perform in  Estéreo Picnic. This was the message of the festival organizers to communicate the news↓

tofiar,"I completely agree with you, man. While I would of course be disappointed, Dave has lost his best friend and collaborator twice now. Whatever he does next, I'll support it. He's just such a good guy.

I've been playing drums most of my life and Dave was my first hero. When Taylor joined Foo Fighters, the two replaced Elton and Bernie as my favorite god tier duo and Taylor became my second hero. While I grew into a drum nerd over the years with tons of additional influences and styles, those two nevertheless made up the core of my drumming.

I loved Neil and even shed a tear after he died. Taylor was the first drummer whose death made me sob. I put on Aurora and those tears were unstoppable. 😅",2022-03-26 09:07:00
tofiar,"If this were similar, I believe Hoffman basically took what he normally took when he was still using and his tolerance was low enough from 20 years that it was a pretty quick OD. 

This terrible, especially because Dave has talked about how hard it was for him to listen to nirvana things because it reminded him of kurt. Granted, times were so much darker then, but Dave has such a huge heart. 

His wife and kids 😭",2022-03-26 04:31:10

73uvvq,"I am so very sad about this. I am in my late 20s and some of my fondest memories of my young childhood included Tom Petty. We always joke and say remember the days when MTV and VH1 actually played music videos...but seriously, that was my thing. I'd plop on the floor at 4 and 5 years old (I remember because it was at my old house and before I started Kindergarten) and watch videos. Thats where I fell for Tom Petty. 

My first cassette was Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers greatest hits. My grandma got me a little purple tape player. I brought the tape player and Tom Petty tape to Kindergarten for my show and tell. 

I told my brother when I grew up, I was going to sing all of his songs. Big brother of course, told me, that's illegal and you'll go to jail ha. 

When my tape player ate my Tom Petty tape, I cried like the world was ending. My dad comforted me by telling me that he let my mom's sister borrow his Tom Petty tape when they were younger and her tape player ate his tape too. (As he was using a pencil to try to wind it back up).

I introduced my cousins to Tom Petty, when my aunt (same aunt who ruined my dad's tape!) would babysit me in the summers. Introduced as in, we're going to listen to this tape all day...my younger cousin also fell in love with him! 

That man. His music. Is like the sound track to my life. I only wish I had dropped the $150 to see him over the summer. A wonderful artist who touched my life, and so many lives of those around me. I received calls and texts today in the same quantity that you would think we lost a close friend. In a way, we did. 

You belong among the wildflowers....somewhere you feel free 😢",2017-10-03 00:06:58

73uvvq,"I’m so crushed. Today is a terrible day with Vegas, but losing Petty is a total gut punch. Still thought I’d have a chance to see him on tour, or new music about his granddaughter. Maybe pull a Loggins and write her some children’s music. All he wanted was to spend more time with her. 

Petty was such a huge part of my teenage years in the 90s. I listen to Free Fallin and I feel 16 years old and like no one would ever be as deep or introspective as I was 🙄

I hear American Girl now, and I feel like maybe I am strong enough to get through some of the shitty stuff I’m dealing with right now.

And, if you don't mind me hijacking this comment for a minute: for others out there who need to reach out during those terrible times please still do so. Even if you have a bad experience doing it, you're still practicing reaching out when times are hard. The world is a hard place, it's not easy to find someone who can help you through it so you have to keep asking. Have multiple people you can talk to for when you feel like you may be overwhelming one friend or partner with your story. Check for groups in your area so you can talk to others going through the same shit, most of them are free! You are important, your life is important. At least 100 people are going to take their life today, please be kind to yourself and stay here. Just stay here for one more day, no matter who you have to talk to, no matter how many people piss you off when you tell them you are hurting...stay here. Eventually you will find the thing that makes you want to stay here forever. Don't stop searching. ",2019-03-26 18:57:24

5us46v,"Hey, professional concert / tour producer here: labels have very, very little decision when it comes to live show lineups. The agents (CAA, WME, PARADIGM) decide who runs on what dates and for what price. The labels and the agents deal with management who are at the top the decision making pile. If the manager doesn't say yes, it's doesn't happen. Labels are essentially PR firms now. Sure, The artists will tour on an album or to promote something else, but labels do next to nothing in the live market. 

(And yes, some labels manage artists and some have 360 deals but it's not a majority by any means)

🎼 On my deathbed I will pray
To the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone
Who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall
I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised
The wine was bled
And there you led me on
In your house I long to be

7ql15r,"My God. This one gets me. Damn it, this makes me so very sad. Rest In Peace, Dolores.

I know lots of people love The Cranberries just like I do but their music really has a special place in my heart. When I was a kid, right after my parents got divorced, I struggled very hard with it. My mom was already with someone new (he’s now my stepdad) and *my* dad would do everything he could to cheer me up and I will always appreciate that. We used to drive up north to the woods and take camping trips, go fishing, hike, walk around the woods, all sorts of stuff. But, we would *always* listen to The Cranberries to and from our trips, as it was a fairly long-ish drive. Listening to their music now always gives me this really bittersweet feeling of being sad as a kid about my parents divorce but also being really, really happy because of the times my dad and I shared when I was a little girl. 

I’m really sad to hear this news. Breaks my heart. 😔",2018-01-15 19:41:59

7ql15r,"I saw her a month ago catering an event for Billboard.  when she performed she was as powerful and raw as ever.  seeing her sing instantly transported me back to 1995, staying up past my bedtime to watch the Cranberries' videos on mtv as a kid and crushing on the lead singer. 

when she sang the choruses of Zombie and Linger, she would let the audience take turns with her to sing along with such charm and genuine pleasure as everyone of course still knew the words to the songs of their childhood and adolescence that she wrote back then.  

in person, she was quiet and solitude, almost as if rationing her energy for the stage.  but still so sweet and kind and gentle with everyone.  it made me really glad that she was still on the road sharing her songs after all these years.  I hope in the end, she was able to share in the happiness she was able to bring to others ❤",2018-01-15 20:17:17

aich3r,"Blocking is okay for that minority of obnoxious artists/bands, but now they need to add a block/ignore on playlists. 

I'd also like to be able to train the Spotify algorithm, because my god it does a shite job. We should be able to like and dislike a genre or artist. There's a big difference between utterly blocking a band/artist to oblivion, and just not wanting to hear them on a daily/hourly occurance. For example, every day I use one of my daily mixes and I always without fail will have The Bear and the Maiden Fair by the Hold Steady. I like that song but not daily much. 

Oh aye. A give it a rest button for songs. That be great too now that I think of it. 

I loved Pandora back in the day for most of these requests I'd like in Spotify... They'll never add any of it, but they really need to give some power back to it's users and not treat us like little babbys 🎶***Rugrats tune starts playing***🎶

Now I don't know when your show was in the tour but he tours a ton and the shows take a lot out of him the older he gets so yes some shows he's not up to do a meet and greet.  That doesn't make someone a bitter angry asshole.

Poor people. Let alone never would they ever pair up with GAP alone (who's known for having cheap and affordable clothing but not recognized in the fashion world) on a good day with their engineers to come up with and sell items with their name on it. 

With the above comment is seems (and I could be wrong) that you either dont: own, care, understand or are around this kind of fashion. And thats ok. You might have the idea that high end fashion should be affordable, and I'm right there with you. In retrospect  ""high-end"" fashion things aren't affordable directly from the seller, like most things. But Kanyes shoes and clothing with the GAP were extremely affordable in comparison to all the other fashion brands. And you can't say they had no influence because plenty of these brand then turned on him and started copying the style...",2022-10-26 01:53:03

yd22r7,"You were able to take apart your car engine? That's pretty fire. I aspire to do that. If my car engine had issues (depending on the type of issue) at this point I'd have no choice but to pay because I know that if I mess up that can cause even more issues down the line causing me to pay for a new engine which is alot more expensive. That just seems practical to me. But if I truly cared enough to take apart my engine it would lead to me understanding it. Same idea with fashion, you have to care about it before you can get to the understanding. 

For sure, fashion can be filled with vain assholes, but thats just people. People can be assholes in any form of life for any amount of reasons. Fashion is more about finding what clothing YOU resonate with. Yeah it's then pimped out and exploited by companies to gain more revenue, and small groups then attempt to feed off of that exploitation causing these snoby group to form and attempt to make certain things more exclusive by driving up the price...but thats life. If you care about how you look, but can't afford certain clothes you can still be fashionable with what you're wearing. For me if I'm comfortable AND I look good, win win. 

Growing up my family had 1 computer that we had to share. Obviously this is the hay day of 🤫 downloads for music, games and movies which came with viruses. Couldn't afford to take it to the tech guys so I had to figure out how to clear them on my own as a kid. That how I learned about coding; out of necessity. My life is littered with times where I have to learn to do something because I cant afford not to. So I get it, you gotta do what you gotta do. I try not to spend my money frivolously but the good thing about the hype in fashion is that if you do buy something and you don't like it you can sell it for more. Doesn't sounds like an insane idea. Take advantage wherever you can",2022-10-26 03:10:47

hf0a5u,"I mean, no matter which song Trump chooses, he's going to get backlash from the band/artist. Why? Bc artists are typically liberal. Liberals typically hate Trump - whether for valid reasons or bc of propaganda doesn't really matter... They don't like him and they're gonna behave like this: ""Dear Trump Campaign. Fuck you. You're not invited. Stop playing my song."" Even though it's art and art is meant to be interpreted and enjoyed by all, right? But that's often the mentality these days... If you get offended or upset, you suddenly have the right to tell ppl how to live!

PS: just to clarify (bc it's easy to assume the worst), I'm not a Trump supporter BY ANY MEANS. Just an artist who advocates equality, fairness, integrity. As a singer/songwriter myself, I'm aware that my work is open to interpretation and I feel like that's beautiful. When ppl I dislike (or simply don't advocate, like Trump) like my music or interpret it to suit their agenda, it doesn't mean the reality of art changes. It's for EVERYONE. Whether I like you or not.

kivjg4,"Hi Paul! I loved ""Egypt Station"", and I can't wait to find the time to listen to ""McCartney III"" with all the time and respect you and your music deserve.

Is there a song in your catalogue that you thought ""Hmm, I'd love to change something about it (maybe the lyrics, maybe the instruments)""?

Have you ever thought of ""revamping"" (not that they need it, though) or making an album with old songs with very different arrangements?

Thank you, you've always been an inspiration, a role model and an enjoyment to listen to. Much love from Chile ♥",2020-12-23 16:08:49

do you particularly like helping people find comfort in your music? is it a conscious goal of yours to be the comforter and give love to the most vulnerable people? 🥺",2020-12-23 16:04:00
kivjg4,"First of all, I want to start off by saying thank you. Thank you to you, John, George and Ringo for giving us such an incredible catalogue of music, your music has changed my life and so many other people’s lives, you’ve honestly been a massive part of who I am today as a person and as a music lover and I am entirely grateful.

So, on with my question. Sir Paul, this album is incredible and it’s obvious that, as usual, you’ve put the upmost thought and care into crafting it (Long Tailed Winter Bird, Find My Way and Deep Deep Feeling are my personal favourites) so my question to you is, in your over 60+ years in the music industry, what has been your favourite AND least favourite project/album to work on? Perhaps an album you look back on now and think, that could have been better. 

Keep rockin’ Sir.✌️🎸",2020-12-23 16:50:16
kivjg4,"Hi Sir Paul!

I really love your new album and just wanted to say that you're a big inspiration for me as a musician, so thank you for your awesome work 💙

When you write songs like ""Long tailed winter bird"" for example, do you build the song around one motif / one riff (which is really catchy, btw!) or does the harmony / chords come first?

Greetings from Germany 

Nico",2020-12-23 16:09:03
kivjg4,"Hey Paul! I’ve got a few,

1. Is the theme of birds (blackbird, bluebird, long tailed winter bird) and planetary things (Venus and Mars, the kiss of Venus, etc.) intentional? Or is it something that just happens by coincidence? 

2. Did you prefer the process of working alone on this album or did you ever wish that you had someone else to bounce ideas off of? 

3. What’s your favorite/ most interesting instrument that you own? 

I absolutely love the new album, it might just be my new favorite! Happy holidays, Paul! ♥️",2020-12-23 16:08:32

And I have inspired the rest of my family to eat more veggie-like. 

Ok that was unrelated to my question but it is this:

Out of all of the albums you have been a part of creating, listening to which one brings back the best memories?

I love the new album! I’ve listened 5 times so far! You once said, especially when Egypt Station came out, that writing music and your guitar can sometimes be like your therapist/therapy. What has been the most therapeutic song in your career for you to write? 

And since it’s Christmas, what are some of your favorite holiday traditions that you take part in? 

I love you so much! You’re the best! 👍🏻",2020-12-23 16:02:47

My question is: When you create these albums, do you reach into your ""vaults"" and see what songs you haven't completed or do you start fresh and create everything brand new? And, will we ever see an album from you of songs you gave to others that includes ""Bad To Me"", ""Just Fun"" and ""From A Window""?",2020-12-23 16:28:13

kivjg4,"Hi Paul. Huge fan of the new album and all of your music! I was hooked right from the first few notes of “Winter Bird” and when the drums dropped in I was blown away by the groove. Amazing start.

I’ve got two questions: How much time do you typically spend laying down the rhythm section? Are the drums and bass usually one or two quick takes to lay the foundation or do you spend lots of time perfecting that groove? 

Also, if you had to choose, what is your personal favourite tune on McCartney III? 

Any insights are appreciated! Much love from Canada! Happy Christmas🎄",2020-12-23 16:56:35

I wanted to ask:

1. How do you go about writing lyrics?

2. Do you think you'll go on any tours if/when the pandemic is over? I'd love to see you live and haven't got the chance to yet. I totally understand if you wouldn't though.

My friend asked me to send her question so here it goes.. 😘

“Before anything, and above everything I would love to tell you, I want to say thank you. Thank you for everything, Paul.

With that being said, do you like tomatoes? I guess you might. I hate them... and I hate cherry tomatoes even more so. They feel gross when chewing at them- it feels like they want to explode on the first bite!

Another question: when is your permanent secretary getting hired? Don't let me down; I've been waiting for 40 years since May 16, 1980... and I am 19 years old.”",2020-12-23 16:09:43

This year has definitely been a challenging one, but I hope you and your family have managed to stay healthy (and sane) during this madness. Here’s hoping 2021 is kinder.

Really loving McCartney III! It’s a fantastic album! Hopefully we get to hear a few of the tracks live on tour when it’s safe to have concerts again!

My question is this, of all the instruments you play, which one do you tend to reach for first when writing a new song? Or does it change depending on your mood?

And aside from recording the new album, what else have you been getting up to during lockdown to keep yourself occupied? Have you tried your hand at learning a new skill (or a new instrument) or have you been focusing more on rest and relaxation?

Thank you and love you!

Big fan here.
Had the privilege of seeing you 36 times live over the last decade and am grateful for all the travelling I did to follow you.
I happen to be one of those you often mention who learned English through your songs and it now pays off as I get to ask you something 😃

So here it goes: now with all that career and all those years or doing gigs around the world, do you sometimes regret that The Beatles stopped playing live after that US Tour?
Do you not feel that Sgt Pepper's or the White Album would have deserved that ""live"" promotion ?

Love you 💕

I loved McCartney III, gotta say I still can’t decide if my favorite song is The Kiss of Venus, Seize The Day or Slidin’ so I guess I’ll stick with all of them 😅

My question is a little bit of a philosophical one, I hope it’s okay. How did you know music was what you’d like to do professionally and also, what advice would you give to young people that want to work in the industry as well?

Thank you so very much for this opportunity, I’m only 19 but I grew up listening to your music ever since I was a baby (Dad is a huge fan, as everyone else, and has been to 12 of your performances in Brazil and also in London once). My first concert ever was your performance at São Paulo, in 2014 and I had the privilege to watch you once more in Porto Alegre, 2017.

I sent you a piece of fan mail I’ve been writing and re-writing since I was in high school in 2011. I sent it out in April of this year to the New York fan mail address at MPL. It was signed for and I’m just hoping that even though all of these wonderful people here and around the world send you fan mail all the time, you’d be able to search for my letter and have someone there get it to you wherever you are. It means the world to my parents and me.

kivjg4,"Hey Paul,

Thank you for your incredible music and congratulations for McCartney III. I won a place to see you at Abbey Road in 2018 and I spent the whole show in tears (fangirl overload). 2 quick questions:

1) My friend runs a zine and community over on Twitter, collating photos of the Beatles drinking tea (@teatlemania). There seems to be thousands of teacups around every recording session. Can you recall how the Beatles took their tea (or any Teatle memories for my friend)?

2) You may not remember, but there are several videos of you and John tapping your fingers, as if to imitate a spider? Can you recall what this gesture meant? It seemed to be an injoke.

Much love and good thanks to you, dear Paul. You deserve the world 💖",2020-12-23 16:24:07

I’m a HUGE fan of both the Beatles and all of your solo/wings stuff.
I absolutely loved the new album- deep deep feeling and kiss of Venus are my favourites right now but I love slidin’ and the first track too.

I wanted to ask that did you have any tours or events (anniversary stuff etc.) planned for next year - even if they are now cancelled or not certain?
Or alternatively where would you most like to tour/play next if you had the choice of anywhere and with whom?

Thank you for the opportunity today, you’re one of my biggest idols and I hope you have a lovely Christmas and a very happy new year!

For me, the music of The Beatles and your solo discography helped me persevere through all life’s struggles. Im not sure if you will ever know just how much you have made a difference in the world, well maybe you do 🤔

If you could go back in time just for a day, what would you relive? What one moment in your life would you choose to experience again? I wonder with someone so accomplished, what is there most cherished moments? Also, how the heck are you??

We love you and we cant thank you enough for what you have given us! My Nonna is the same age as you and I love listening to her tell me stories of beatlemania and all that jazz.",2020-12-23 16:27:22
kivjg4,"Hi Paul!

Hope you and your family have been staying healthy and safe during these very difficult times. 

Oh! So I love “Long Tailed Winter Bird” and “Lavatory Lil” on McCartney III. Such a great record, it always amazes me just how prolific you are. Will there ever be a time where you’ll just run out of things to say through your music? I somehow don’t see that happening, 😄

So, 2020 has definitely thrown a wrench in all of our plans. I know you were supposed to play Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary (hope that can still happen when it’s safe again, 🤞🏽) but were there any other plans you were looking forward to this year? I know you just toured in 2019, but are there any new tentative touring plans in the works?

Miss seeing you light up that stage! I don’t think I’ve ever been happier than when I’m at one of your shows. 

Love,

kivjg4,"Hello Sir Paul! My mother has been a fan of you since she was 4 and saw you play on the Ed Sullivan Show for the very first time! She's been playing your music for as long as I can remember and I still look forward to visiting her on the off chance I can wake up and find her jamming to you and your music in the morning while making herself coffee. You're just about her favorite guy side from my father and since she doesn't have socials I figured I could ask a question for both of us! She is more familiar with the it's and outs of your music but I've been curious if you have ever taken inspiration from Latin American or Chicano influences for your music or artwork? My family is from Ciudad Juárez so I'm just curious if anyone from Mexico and the rest of Latin America has influenced you along the way? Perhaps there's an artist from there that gets you jamming on Saturday mornings as well! In any case, we both listened to McCartney III together and loved it, it was a wonderful experience. Thank you for always providing a nice surprise for my mother and for keeping her dreaming, she's never doubted that one day she'll meet you face to face and if there's a tour she can save up for, she's going no matter what.

As your biggest fan, I've got a question or two. 

A Day In The Life is a favourite of mine, what does it mean? Whenever I listen to it I always take it as John's parts being a dream/thought-state and your part being our lucid/focused parts of the day. Please can you clarify?

I also have a question about the unfinished song of John's 'Now and Then'. I've heard from the grapevine of the world wide Web that you will finish it for John one of the these days. I was just wondering when?

1) All Lives Matter This concept helps me to believe, a little. 
2) Your last couple of albums, help me feel some hope in a very prejudice & troubled world.
3) They way & some other musicians have created their music videos helps me to try & write my music the ""right"" way (cuz I seem to have trouble & end up with poetry instead), lol!!
4) QUESTION: would you please, if possible in your very busy schedule, check out my music at SoundCloud?? Liquid Ice Entertainment, Renn Reed, Mark Barth??

I'm not trying to publicize or market here, really!! I'm not like that. But no one seems to be able to help me (all those I've approached) with figuring out HOW to ADD my Lyrics. 

I seem to write music first with the musical environment I want, but get lost in how to write & add my lyrics for my movie, ""Lost Angels[The Discovery].

Anyway, just hoping for some tips, advice, not trying to advertise here. I do really appreciate you a lot. Also, I'm TRYING to transition to VEGAN. Not easy to do, no one seems to have tips on that either.

kivjg4,"Hi Paul! Thank you so much for the brilliant new album (and the most beautiful new video!❤️). I’d like to ask you these questions if it’s okay: 

1. What are some things (like forms of art, music genres or sports or anything else really) you’ve never tried before that you’d love to do/ learn to do?

2. While you were working on McCartney III did you at any time feel John and/or George’s presence around? Do you think you’ve channeled any of their musical or lyrical ideas on this album along with your own? 

3. During the rockdown did you have the time to read much? If you did, what book/ books left a lasting impression on you (if any)? 

4. Like many people, I found the Egypt Station cover fascinating (I know it’s a painting by you and I’m very impressed by your talent as an artist). Do you think symbolism is an innate quality of art? If so, what’s the symbolism behind the McCartney III cover?

Thank you so much for giving me the chance to ask these questions and of course for both McCartney III and Egypt Station which I keep coming back to. You’ve been a constant source of inspiration for me since I discovered your music at 10 and deep inside I think of you a my guiding light throughout my life. Thank you for being you and Merry Christmas to you and yours! Hope you’re having a great time! Much love 😊",2020-12-23 16:37:11
kivjg4,"Hi Paul, 

Thank you for all the years of music. I can’t thank you enough for all the joy and friendship you’ve brought to my life because of your songs.

 Did the circumstances of the pandemic influence the way you conceived the new album? If so, were the circumstances a help or hinderance to the creative process of McCartney iii? 


Also, you were part the reason I went vegetarian when I was 14, so thank you for your tireless animal activism! :)


Lots of love❤️

kivjg4,"Hey Paul,I love youuuuuuuuuu❤As for questions,I have one I'd written down in a list of questions to ask you 😅It's very specific and don't worry if you don't know the answer,it's ""Who played lead guitar in the cover version of  Buddy Holly's ""That'll Be Day"" you recorded back in 58 as the b-side to your first recording with The Quarrymen which had ""In Spite Of All The Danger"" as the a-side,which I ADORE by the way,not because of it  being in ""Nowhere Boy"" but cause I love it and I think it's such a nice song inspired by a lovely Elvis track ""Trying To Get To You"",but yeah was it you or George?""😅I read about this doubt in a book called ""Revolution In The Head:The Beatles' records and the Sixties"" by Ian Macdonald.I know you don't read many books about The Beatles cause they always contain some wrong information but I just thought of asking haha.I love you❤I can't believe you might actually read this.Stay safe❤",2020-12-23 16:45:38
kivjg4,"Good day, Sir Paul! I seriously can’t believe we’re all getting this chance to speak to you directly - THANK YOU! 
My entire life, I have been a huge fan of yours, along with, of course, your mates....(even named my two corgis Abbey and Rhodie “Abbey Road”) and have raised my son to love and study your music.

The one thing I wished for myself (which obviously never happened -lol) was to one day be one of your low brass studio or tour musicians (I played bass trombone).
My son is now at uni, studying Music Education with focus on Tuba and Trombone.
Apple doesn’t fall far...
So I guess this is my question. Beings how you are so talented on so many different instruments, what are the traits and requirements that you look for in studio & tour band mates who you work with?
I mean, you are PAUL!!! How on earth can someone compete with that? 😂

Much love and peace to you and your entire family! Thank you for shaping all our lives!",2020-12-23 16:56:30

My question is regarding the third song you talked about that was available from John when you were working on the Beatles Anthology that you didn't end up using. I know you mentioned in the Jeff Lynne documentary that came out a few years ago that you want to grab Jeff Sometime to potentially finish up. Is that something that a project you are still looking to work on in the future?

My question- Having listened to iii last night, I realised these albums are just you trying to process what’s happening at the time. Has there ever been a certain trigger that makes you go, “This has to be on tape?” 

Thanks again so much for everything. 🙂",2020-12-23 16:16:03

Love your entire work from The Beatles to Wings to your solo career. I've got a couple of questions:

- While you were recording McCartney III, given that it's a family record, did the memory of Linda came in at any moment? did a song besides When Winter Comes been inspired by her or a memory of your times with her?

- For Beatles fans there's been a debate wheter you or John sang the ""ahhs"" before the last verse in A Day In The Life, can you clarify this?

As a bassist I think you’re the absolute best, you’ve inspired me to try and be the best I can with the instrument, and I think that your tone, your lines and the presence you get is amazing and many times ahead of its time.

Loved the album, it feelt like a perfect sequel to McCartney I & II and an innovation too, beeing classic and sofisticated at the same time. No doubt, one of my favorties of the album it's Slidin' and I wanted to ask how the song came up, what was like working on it?

I noticed in ‘Women and Wives’ you speak in the plural to everyone (wives, lovers, sisters, brothers) — but ‘husband’ singular! And just who is this one lone mysterious husband you had in mind?  Why does he need to hear you?🤔

Huge fan (just like everyone else), but what was it like hearing from your mother in your sleep? I know it has been the catalyst for some of your best songs, but how did you know/ trust that it was your mom?

Non-musical questions here. You used to wear a bracelet back in the sixties. Does it have a story behind it? Some kind of ID bracelet? I've always wondered. LOL

Also, the latest photos that have been released of you and John together were May Pang's from 1974. Linda being Linda ♥️, I assume you have some from later in the seventies. If so, would you ever consider releasing them?

(I know it doesn't pertain to Humanz exactly) but how was working with André 3000? On DoYaThing? Are you guys ever gonna collaborate again? I heard that if given more time, there would've been more songs. He is my favourite rapper and you guys are my favourite band, and I was so excited when you guys were on the same song. Are we ever gonna get a new song from you guys or hear some of the scraps from making DoYaThing? Also, smaller question: are you gonna play The Fall songs on the US concerts? I'm saving up to go to Life Is Beautiful and see ya guys. At least one like Revolving Doors or Hillbilly Man? Or Amarillo? That's be cool.

Couldn’t name any current top country, pop or rap artists. There are genres I just don’t delve into anymore. I heard of Travis Scott when my wife told me he got a Kardashian pregnant, and forgot about him until this. It doesn’t make me cool or make me think I am. It’s just personal preferences. I don’t get the peeps that get offended or eye-roll the fact that you don’t listen to or know who a certain artist is. 

Read a lot of his devoted followers’ replies on this situation and just wow. Glad I’m not a part of that community.

ax61ya,"At the Big Day Out concert in Adelaide in the late 90’s, Prodigy were one of the headline acts, and I was fortunate enough to be working front stage security for their concert. Amazing atmosphere, even better music, and then my favourite Prodigy song came on: Poison. I couldn’t help it, but I turned around to watch Keith sing... and he locks eyes with me, stops the music, points at me, and says into the mic “Security, I want to see the back of your fucking head!”. 😳 I turned bright red, the crowd went nuts, Keith gave me a little smirk and a cheeky wink and went back to song! Best concert ever!!",2019-03-04 14:49:00
ax61ya,"I’m really sad about this. He was my favorite vocalist next to Trent. I remember the first time I heard The Prodigy in like the 4th grade and it definitely changed my life. Keith Flint inspired me to be myself, and the group’s music paved the way for the music I listen to even still. I was fixing to get tickets to the Terminal 5 shows once my next paycheck came in too.... this is truly a bummer. To anyone else hurting about this, I’m with you. ❤️",2019-03-04 12:48:20
ax61ya,"A bit of me died today with Keith.

The prodigy made me think about music in a completely different way. As a child, all you really pick up on are popular songs, or your parents music. Hearing prodigy made me realise there’s other music out there, and it’s fucking awesome. They were the whole package. They had amazing technical music skills, could put on a beast of a live show, were completely unapologetic about what they did and always pushed the envelope. 

To a man who put his all into what he believed in, I raise a glass, and happily whack on a playlist in your honour. 🍺

RIP",2019-03-04 16:27:02
ax61ya,Out of space is one of my all time fav tracks. I worshipped these guys when I was a teenager in the 90’s. Watched them live a few times. Shout out to anyone who went to see them at the bowl. I think I’ve still got the old vhs tape they made with all the old music vids on. They even have some odd little out take bits on it. Worth looking for if you’re a fan.   I used to practice the dance moves for hours to dance a bit like them. Not as good as Leeroy obviously. My heart goes out to everyone effected by this. And thank you prodigy for helping me through some crazy times in my life. You won’t be forgotten k 👍🏻 reach for the lazers up high.,2019-03-04 21:35:39
ax61ya,"absolute bummer to hear this 

grew up on a steady diet of the prodigy cus my cousins were super into britain’s clubbing and rave scene

me and a mate hopped a fence to hear these guys in brisbane last month. got asked to move on so we hightailed it deep into the crowd. one of the ballsiest things i’ve ever done but it was worth it for these guys.

Considering their age and the intensity of their music, you would've thought the energy would diminish over time. Not with these crazy bastards. The last time I saw them, Keith and Maxim were still running and jumping around like they were in their early 20s. Prodigy shows always had the best mosh pits too. Great times.

See the ridiculous games the staunch wayward homosexual community plays? These are the facts: hardcore advocates of homosexuality are truthophobes. Because their consciences, and the Bible, and the Holy Spirit, and nature and societal norms and common sense (or is that uncommon sense) tells a person homosexuality is wrong and ungodly.

I’m not advocating for violence against women at all, but people make mistakes. HE WAS 20 YEARS OLD. Rihanna already said she started hitting him in his face multiple times first. If it was just me and you alone in a room together, neither one of us could leave and I kept getting you in the face over and over again, I’m pretty sure snapped at some point and savagely attack me too. Especially at 20 years old. Wrong is wrong, but you make it seem like he OJ Simpson’ed RiRi and then went on to keep selling millions of records. That shit was over 10 years ago. He’s literally in his 30’s now. You make it seem like his life should be no more and he should pretty much just crawl into a hole a die. Just because he did some super trifling ass shit when he was 20 years old doesn’t mean he should have to be banished from society for the rest of his life. If he would’ve got in a fight with a man and beat him up, you wouldn’t even care and it wouldn’t be a big deal.

e7ulri,"Two words: Promethazine Codeine.

Lil Wayne had tons of seizures over the years from lean. Ric Ross had a seizure so bad he wet himself in bed with a girl back when HE was drinking lean, Dj Screw literally collapsed during a set and he drank lean every day, which he overdosed from. Pimp C died of an overdose of syrup, and Curren$y slept from Louisiana to Florida on a tour bus with lil Wayne after downing a whole bottle of syrup he thought was just Hawaiian Punch. Lil Boosie used to have seizures from doing lean too. I'm not trying to bash Juice Wrld, but did we NOT expect this to happen? I mean, he did put out a album called ""Wrld on Drugs"" and the picture shows a cup of lean being poured onto the world.👀

In the rap game, you get paid a lot of money. Even after you pay all your bills, buy a crazy expensive car, and spend thousands at the club, there's a lot of money left over; People get burnt out on weed eventually.

Remember, as in all things, both Sturgeon's Law (""Ninety percent of *everything* is crap"".) and Niven's Corollary (""...but the remaining 10% is worth *dying* for."") apply. To aid you in your search, I give you [this](https://youtu.be/0hi1jVceof8): ""I Want You To Want Me"" - Vintage Blues Cheap Trick Cover ft. Sara Niemietz from PosmodernJukebox, one of *many* of their reimaginings of modern songs in ""old-fashioned"" styles from folks with more pipes than a plumbing warehouse, no ""Auto-tune"" in earshot... and that's just to *ease* you in. There's *plenty* of *awesome* music out there, if you're willing to let go of your pre-conceived notions and *search* for it among the *admitted* dross... because, let's face it, a lot of the music from 30 years ago and ""Your Generation"" was *crap*, too... I *know*, because I was there, listening to it too. (*ahem* Disco *ahem*)

I got in trouble one time because I was supposed to go to bed but sneaked out to watch a RATM VHS we had. True rebel here! :)

Anyways, I'm sure you get this question a lot: is there any chance of a RATM reunion?

Also, have you ever thought about recording a song with Muse?

dib07s,"First of all, don't give up man! Always keep going, take solace in the small victories - find stuff adequate for your skill that you enjoy listening to, Google up chords, tabs, notation or whatever your jam is. I found this really effective for keeping me interested when I first started. I'm entirely self taught over three years now and I can tell you I've had many-month-spanning period where I didn't play at all, or made no progress, or otherwise became frustrated at my inability to progress. It's not easy, but though the road is long I have but stumbled a short way, I have managed my way past dozens of seemingly insurmountable hurdles - you can too brother!

To break down what Tom said for you;

Technique: the literal act of playing the guitar. How he's moving his fingers, where to on the fretboard, how to bend just right etc. This could mean doing fretboard drills or difficult (relative to your skill) pieces over and over, or trying to master any given specific noise you're looking to blare.

Theory: why (Western) music is what it is. At a basic level: what notes are, what keys & chords are, how notation works & why. At a higher level: song structures, time signatures, modes etc.

Songwriting: creating a song, or rather 'writing' its individual elements (you would still 'write' a guitar line for example... (do you write a drumtrack or do you track it??)). Wholistically, songwriting is the act of looking to create a finished piece.

Improv: up to interpretation depending on what Tom meant but probably playing basically 'aimlessly' other than to make crispy licks, maybe noting them down for future songwriting. Sometimes with backing music, sometimes not; it's improv baby we easy.

Good luck 👍",2019-10-15 21:40:47

gxpjq0,"I'm not a huge fan, but there are some country songs that are better than anything on the 'pop' playlist. There are only 2 songs that can make me cry instantly and one of them is a country song (don't ask).

I've thought a lot about country music and what has happened to it. It used to be that most major cities had a country station and that station had to cover a lot of ground. The purists, the roots folks, the party people, the country-rock folks, etc. Now, the party people seem to have taken over; I can listen for about 3 songs before I am done.

I have 2 deeply held theories about country music, neither of which has any support from anything, so I can just say them right now. 😘

1. The underlying emotion under traditional, old-school country was LONELINESS. The loneliness of the prairie, the cattle drive, of living on a ranch, of being with people but not being WITH them. 'I'm so lonesome I could die', etc. Loneliness is so powerful. It's a universal emotion. It's tinged with shame 'why don't you have any friends, loser?' It's an experience that is strangely contradictory: when you hear or sing a song about loneliness, you don't FEEL so alone - it is other people nod and half-smile and think 'yep, been there myself'.

But we aren't SUPPOSED TO BE LONELY. IT'S SHAMEFUL. So, we hear this utter shite about beer and trucks and blonde girls in sundresses and boots dancing in the headlights on a summer night (and if they're dancing to one of those songs, well, the party's over) and somehow, we all just found our way down to the river or creek or lake without a DUI and we're just... ah, I can't even write about it.
To me, country music is a kid, told since birth that he's dirt, he's staying dirt and the hamster-wheel life he's on is as good as its ever going to get. He has thoughts and feelings and dreams, and he can't talk to anyone about it because that would mark him as 'weird' and in a town of 5-10 thousand people, being weird is pretty much either exile or a death sentence. Distill that kid's cry of rage and loneliness into a song and THAT'S a country song I could listen to for days.

2. Country music tells stories better than any other genre of music today. Country writers KNOW their history and they know that they are competing with freaking novels in three and a half minutes with a chorus after the second verse. I used to write a screenplay about country music (yes, that verb form/usage is correct) and one of my characters, the old sage who advises the young artist, said: 'When America talks to itself in bed at night, it sounds like a country song.'

Now, I have some slight idea of what that means, not exactly but it sounded like what I believe. If I loved music more (I know, I know. An American man saying he DOESN'T LIVE OR DIE FOR MUSIC, what kind of monster am I!?!?),  I'd love to hear from other people what songs tell the best stories about what it means to be a human being.

As a teacher and a writer, I know that the most important element of any work of art is THEME, that statement by the artist about life or humanity or existence. Without a theme, a song is just a jingle, a movie is just porn, a building is just a box, a painting is just a gum-wrapper.",2020-06-07 01:27:45

The salon where I get a pedicure seems to always have pop country playing (yay, rural NE Connecticut 🙄), and my main observation is how much of rap/R&B rhythms and styles have been co-opted by this trash genre.  They sing about all this redneck ‘Murica dog whistle bullshit while riding on black artists coattails.

ao3rjk,"The age group of the 'millennials' they surveyed was between the ages of 18 & 25. 🤨 How fucking big is the Millennials generation?!

Anyways..

Meh it's mainly focusing on recognition of top songs. Of course more people will recognize older songs more than newer ones, older songs are played more in everything. Whether it's movies, commercials, etc. NO FUCKING DUH.

The title is referring to the last few paragraphs where they mention how on Spotify people are choosing to listen to music that predate their age. I believe this can be viewed in two different ways. It can either be pretentious, younger people look up to older folks so they want to listen & know older songs to 'fit in' with them. It can also be due to older music just sounding better. 

I'm 24 & I prefer to listen older music. I listen to old rider oldies, 80's/90's rap & R&B & classic/psychedelic rock because that's what my family listened to when I was growing up. I was raised by my grandparents (oldies & psychedelic rock), had a 10 year older sister (80's/90's rap & R&B from mom & cousins) & spent weeks/months with my aunt & her husband (classic rock). I do also listen to music between the 30's - 50's, musicals, big bands, etc. I was exposed through Family Guy & actually liked the times Brian & Stewie sang so I started searching up the music & movies on my own. 80's/90's pop due to them being sampled more in movies/commercials, younger & now, so I already have that exposure to it. When I search them up, I like them.

I think the only new music I like are the experimental, witch house, electronica & chillwave. Of course I like some pop, hip-hop, r&b etc here & there. But for the most part it doesn't interest me to the point I search them out.",2019-02-08 04:46:36

u6epgy,"Anyone that likes the ‘grunge/Seattle/90s’ sound absolutely has to be sure to include Screaming Trees, Mudhoney, and the lesser known TAD, who in my opinion is possibly actually the best ‘grunge’ band of them all. Listen to TAD’s ‘Inhaler’ album first and I expect you’ll be blown away by it from the very first notes to the very last. It always leaves me feeling like it should have just kept going and going.

Another Seattle band that was most popular during the 90s, but is still putting out solid music and deserves to be known is Sky Cries Mary. Their fit is primarily psychedelic and progressive rock, but the style really does vary a lot from first album ‘Until the Grinders Cease’ (which was more of an industrial album) to their latest just released this year ‘Wandering in the Vastness’ that is really quite good.

Some particularly notable things about this band is that their lineup has varied quite a bit over the years, but through and through it has always been the vehicle of one Roderick Wolgamott (aka Romero during most of the middle years when his then wife Anisa Romero was co-lead singer), the only member from ‘Grinders’ era; which originally included as the supporting band, the likes of Ken Stringfellow and Jon Auer, who departed the SCM path because they had just started the band that they are best known for, The Posies. The makeup of the band over the years has had a number of very notable members, with the only other member from this era still remaining as the other core member and fellow songwriter, Ben Ireland (aka Bennett James on some earlier album credits) whose primary instrument is the drums, but he is also really versatile with other instruments, which is especially displayed on the album they released this year.

In addition to Roderick and Ben, the present SCM lineup includes one of the biggest names in rock production, who has recorded the likes of Mudhoney, TAD, Screaming Trees, Green River, and so many more I can’t even think of at the moment, but chances are you’ve listened to at least one (if not several) of the albums he has produced, possibly most notably Nirvana’s debut album ‘Bleach.’ He’s pretty much responsible for Nirvana’s big break with Sub Pop when Kurt first brought their music to him. Oh yeah, his name is Jack Endino, and he also has a bunch of really good solo albums, and has played with several other bands as well, possibly best known to some for Skin Yard. He has now played guitar on, and produced!, both of the most recent SCM albums. Also joining him in this new iteration of the band is: on guitar as well, Kevin Whitworth (of Love Battery); on bass, Curt Eckman (also Love Battery, and the Walkabouts); and on backup vocals, Debra Reese.

And if those names didn’t trigger any excitement/interest, here are a few former members that might:

1. Drums on a couple of the ‘Don’t Eat The Dirt’ EP tracks (which was the 2nd SCM release), and backup drummer when Ben wasn’t available, was Scott Mercado, best known for his many years as the drummer for Candlebox.

2. Keyboards/synth on I think 3-4 of SCM’s subsequent albums, Gordon Raphael, likely best known now as a top producer, who has recorded albums for a number of people, including most notably the man responsible for the sound of one of the albums from the above list, ‘This Is It’ by The Strokes!

3. Bass player for many of the middle years when SCM was arguably their most popular, went by the name Juano at the time. However, his real name is Jon Davison, whom some of you might recognize because for the past 10 years or so, he has been the lead singer for the band Yes!

4. On guitar for the ‘Return to the Inner Experience’ album was Marc Olsen, who also wrote the song Rosaleen from that album. Marc has also released a few really great solo albums, but for many he is probably best known for the band Sage (the Seattle one at least).

5. On guitar for several of the middle years was Michael Cozzi, probably best known to those in the psychedelic rock world for his time playing in Shriekback. More recently he has been playing in the band The Security Project, which is a ‘cover band’ of Peter Gabriel’s earliest work prior to the album ‘So’ that also features one of Gabriel’s original drummers, Jerry Marotta.

6. And on guitar for a brief period of time in the early days was Ivan Kral, who is best known for being in Patti Smith’s band.

Anyway, so there are a few pretty damn good reasons to go listen to Sky Cries Mary, and decide for yourself if any of it needs to be in your own library. Bandcamp is the best place to get it, which supports the band most directly, but most of the major streaming services also have most of their music available. Oh, and if you’ve seen the movie Tank Girl, then you’ve already heard a brief intro to their song ‘Shipwrecked’ that was the music they used for the long animated transition that focused on the tank and jet rebuilds.


**Full Disclosure:: While I have been a genuine fan of Sky Cries Mary since around ‘92, and write this as a fan excited to share trivial things such as these, and possibly introduce new fans to the music…

I also happened upon becoming friends with Ben around ‘94, and since that time also ended up spending many years assisting the band with many things, including selling merch at shows, setting up gear, load-in/outs, and even driving them, and/or their gear, around on several tours. So I also happen to know most of the people mentioned personally. But that just happens to be a correlation, because it’s the fan in me that likes to talk about and share such things, which I could also do for a number of other bands—but it’s probably already more than long enough and I guess I actually have shit to do today as well, so….🤘🤩🤘",2022-04-18 21:23:40

Some suggestions:

For the origins: Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley. More singles and a little less complete albums, but still. This is where they all learned it. 

Some more classic rock: Deep Purple, Lou Reed, The Kinks, Neil Young, Jefferson Airplane, Steppenwolf. 

A bit more metal: Pantera, Slayer, Slipknot, Lamb of God.

Jazz-turns crazy carnival noise rock over the years: Tom Waits. 

And since you liked Bobs lyrics I can recommed listening to all Elton John albums with Bernie Taupin lyrics. 

Also for more women: Janis Joplin, Joni Mitchell, The Slits, Alanis Morisette. 

And one of my favourite current bands: Black Rebel Motorcycle Club

u6epgy,"Man, I'm seriously impressed. This list, and your notes on it, is a work of art in its own right. I'm a rock fan and you've covered much more ground than I have - those earlier albums especially I have only explored in bits and pieces, I was just casually wandering through 90s rock because that's when I started really listening to music. I'm very familiar with all those, but beyond some Beatles and Beach Boys, I'm having trouble thinking of any whole albums I've listened to from the 60s. 

This is an inspiration, both to check out some of the stuff that I've missed or written off (I *hated* Karma Police, playing 3 times an hour, when it came out, so I've resisted Radiohead, probably unfairly, ever since), and to maybe undertake a similar (smaller 😅) project with some of the rap lists people have mentioned above.

I'll echo others, it's fascinating to me which bands you'd never heard of before, that were massive and unavoidable for me. Pearl Jam, in particular, is one that I think will be interesting for you to listen to more of - they changed so much from album to album, at least from what I expected of them. They still sound like Pearl Jam, but the songs definitely feel very different from album to album.

Thanks for sharing!",2022-04-18 20:26:57

There so many groovy/types but I'll take it easier in my recommendations and you can grow from there if you like it!

Killswitch Engage - The End of Heartache
        The band has been nominated for Grammys multiple times.  I know of at least two where they lost to motorhead and then Ozzy.  This is my personal favorite band for so many reasons.  Been a fan since first hearing self revolution (a song from the album before this one) 

Lamb of God - Ashes of the Wake
        Grovey awesome metal.  They sound almost exactly the same live (at least the many times I saw them 2015 and before). As the Palaces Burn might be a good one too, but ashes first!

In Flames - Reroute to Remain
        The grandfather's of metalcore, melodic sweedish metal

Trivium - Ascendancy
        Modern Metallica, but better and more talented.  Metallica paved the way, these guys recapped it in gold

I'm not blaming rap for the shitty culture, I'm saying that rap promotes that shitty culture, and exports it out of the hood and into everywhere, and I don't think that's good thing. I guess we will see..but I don't see a lot of good coming from it.

I'm just tired of hearing the non stop crimes, violence, rapes, and murders being bragged about in songs...and then watching a 10 year old reciting that on TikTok or Worldstar makes my stomach turn.

7rmt34,"Tom Petty was a true artist. He was able to connect every sect of society with his down to earth tone, and his honest song writing. 

His lyrics connected people all around the world, provided hope, and offered bravery to those who felt beaten down by life-- be it love, anguish, or celebration. 

He obviously took hold of these values in his writing through his family, who now offers us with a clear and honest message of tragedy. 

In order to raise awareness they release a brave and transparent report on what happened to their loved one who touched so many around the globe. In turn, they, like Tom, offer us an honest perspective of our realities in this tragic time of the opioid epidemic. 

We thank his family, and we love you Tom.

osv4uv,"Fuuuuck dude, this is so sad. 😔 

I remember seeing the music video for ""Left Behind"" the first time on MTV when I was 12 years old, just thinking ""What the hell IS THIS?"" I was disturbed, but also totally captivated and fascinated. I would be really into Slipknot the next couple of years, they were one of my gateways into Metal, and Iowa and Volume 3 are probably on my list of all-time most-played records. Joey was also one of the drummers that inspired me to pick up the sticks and make music myself.

I was never one of those dudes that outright hated on Jay just because he's not Joey, I think he's a very capable drummer and can play many parts more cleanly in a live setting than even Joey. But, that being said, I did feel that with Paul's death and Joey's departure, the band was never quite the same anymore. Jay's got his shit together and he serves the music really well, but Joey was part of the foundation of what made Slipknot so unique and successful in the first place, and, most under-appreciated by many people, he wasn't ""just the drummer"", but also one of the main songwriters. His drum parts always felt like integral parts of the songs instead of just accompaniment and I also think he was one of the driving forces of the band internally.

I guess a part of me had always hoped for at least a temporary reunion, maybe just for a couple of gigs or one record. Not just for the music, but also to see the guys on good terms with one another again. Now that chance has been taken away forever.

Rest in Peace Joey.",2021-07-27 22:49:21

Are you 2 suddenly a couple now and just not saying it? Everyone says that you're more like a brother and sister dynamic but the it seems possible that you could be something more from how you react to each other sometimes. For example: I don't know a lot of siblings or friends who will get mad at someone for playing videogames when they have something important to do.

I found it done better collecting cookies and matching better tracks to the ones I listened to rather than random poorly selected ones I'd have been given from Spotify in the past two years previously. I now use YouTube subscription. That then gives me music and video. Unsubscribed from every other provider for now, Netflix etc over all its the business but I DJ so I listen to new tracks on YouTube then buy tracks and merch regardless to support artists from multiple online music stores.

hhc2l1,"As I understand it from my lawyer, the ambient sound from the venue is actually MORE usable than the DI directly from the DJ, as it has sound and talking from the people IN the venue. On top of that it is more difficult for the algorithms to pick out what the song is (like when Shazam can’t identify a song in a crowded restaurant or an intense scene of a tv show) when posted to some social media. 
I’ve heard about the technicalities of “venues” and licenses and it’s all b/s. Weddings are intimate and private events. You can play what ever the hell you want to at an event like that because guests are not PAYING to be there and the venue is not PROFITING from those guests as a direct result of the music being played. Therefore the venue does not need a “dance floor” license. It is just like having a party at your house, you can play whatever you want from Spotify for your guests, you just hired somebody specifically to make the perfect playlist and transition songs professionally and take requests. That DJ is performing an art that strings songs together. 
Now I have done bigger public events, clubs and corporate events where I have to submit my playlist after performing so that the artists/labels can be compensated for that performance and that is a whole different thing. 
Also, for a couple thousand dollars you could buy a broadcast license and broadcast that shit on say your DJ website (as an audio stream only), but once it gets synced up with any type of video, and is available publicly, it enters the realm of video licensing and then the price for most top40 music is astronomical. I’m talking you could have a 15 song video mix and accidentally rack up 1/2M of licensing fees because you did not pre-authorize and negotiate a price for that music with the artists/labels and some of those artists in their peak can get 100k per song used for sync.

If you have a lot of money and shitty family members who know a sleazy lawyer, and you can’t defend yourself, then yeah you might be conserved.",2022-11-01 05:56:14

yipi3f,">And I don't think he's evil or malicious.

I disagree, supporting antisemitism and anti black racism (called self hate, i.e., kanye's ""slavery was a choice"" dreck) while being black definitely makes him so.

 >The dude is just dumb with a huge ego and surrounded by the wrong people.

 Kanye is definitely acting dumb. No argument from me on this one.

>But he's still largely responsible for his actions. You can't just ""mental health"" hand wave it all away.

Right. 🎯 

Exactly how I feel. Mental illness is no excuse to act stupid. 

Conflating his actions with mental illness is IMO, a real insult to people struggling with mental illness who are not rich and famous, the regular Joe, non-hateful people just trying to make sense of the world. There's a difference between mental illness and willful evil, and to me Kanye is guilty of the latter. 

>Get your shit together, Kanye. Get in touch with real family and friends you had before 2002. Recognize that the people you've surrounded yourself with are part of the problem and find people you can trust more than yourself.

Absolutely right. He can do this - he just has to WANT to. 

But as long as he gets benefits and attention for playing crazy, he will keep up this ""crazy"" act.",2022-12-19 18:23:40

Unfortunately for MS there is no definitive test to say yes, you have MS. Rather a multitude of tests that will either strongly suggest you have it or not. Unfortunately she has it 😞 But! Her chances of ending up in a wheelchair are slim because the treatments for it nowadays are much more advanced. She has a monthly infusion of Tysbari, 6 monthly spine/brain MRI (to check for active lesions), 6 monthly JCV blood test (MS patients are susceptible and if she gets it, she can't have Tysbari anymore) and a gym membership with a physio who wrote her a workout plan to keep her muscle strength up.

zfxan9,"Not ALS, but when my grandmother entered the hospice stage that’s pretty much what happened. She was barely breathing and barely conscious, but at the same time seemingly in a lot of pain. The hospice nurse kept coming in to tell my mom to administer another dose of morphine. My mom broke down saying she’s scared of ODing her. I basically pulled her aside and tearfully told her that the point of all the morphine was to let her pass as quietly and comfortably as possible. Mom couldn’t do it, and I took over administering for her. I was barely 20 years old and not at all ready to become a man that day, but that’s basically what I felt happened. Weirdest, most awful day of my life, but I’m glad I was there to do it.

The fans understand this stuff?  they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these bars?  to realize that?- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike eminem truly ARE idiots, of course they wouldn't appreciate for instance the humour in slims existencial catchphrase ""im just playnig diddy you know i love you ,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons, I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as marshalls genius unfolds itself on their youtube  screens.

My best friend who moved cross country a few years prior met me there (specifically to see Blink 182 mind you.) and we were getting ready for the shows on the third day when they were supposed to play, when they made the announcement that Travis Barker had caught pneumonia and the whole band bailed so they got My Chemical Romance to stand in (great performance but I was still grumpy) I thought that was so fucking lame of the whole band to bail just because of Travis. Now he’s with Kim Kardashian? When I heard that it just solidified my hatred of him. Maybe I’m still just butt hurt for them cancelling, maybe I just hate the elitists, maybe both. Idk.

I spent the first decade of my life in California in the 90s, I'll never forget my parents buying Fush Yu Mang on cassette on a road trip from the Bay down to San Diego/Coronado. I was blown away by Walkin On The Sun and the Fonz.

it was sad to watch his very public spiral. hope he found some peace in the end. sending good vibes to his surviving loved ones because no one deserves to die that young, no matter what you think of smash mouth or him personally.   

that being said...  
-----‐-----------------------      
✨️ **THE YEAR WAS 1997** ✨️   
   
my mother bought me a cassette tape of mary kate & ashley's ""brother for sale"" and the cd version (!!!) of ""fush yu mang"" by an up and coming band called ***smash mouth*** (i think it had *just* come out). anyway, i was ~~very young~~ nine years old and it was literally the fourth or fifth album in my collection... it was the second cd i had ever owned.   

i had just gotten a cd / double deck tape player for christmas that year and it all felt very high tech and fancy at the time. that still makes me cringe-giggle when I think about it and yes, I am still a little ashamed of the musical choices my mom made for me that day, which I'm sure you can tell from the intense and fervent **need** i still feel (at the ripe old age of *thirty-four*) to justify the musical street cred of a nine year old appalachian girl growing up in the nineties.

i thought that i had matured enough to be *over* musical elitism and hipster snob shit. i am a firm believer in the nonexistence of so-called ""guilty pleasures""; people like what they like and sometimes what they like sucks to varying degrees for all sorts of different reasons. but nobody should ever be made to feel bad about experiencing joy or grooving on good vibes, no matter what dorky band or shitty song happens to be the catalyst... 

but seriously, i am a musician, and if *certain people* were to find this comment and discover this very juicy and extremely uncool secret side of myself (which i have just revealed to the entire internet), i would probably ***never*** hear the end of it.

here's hoping you're a bitchin' black-winged angel chillin' in rock and roll heaven, adorned in heavenly vestments of flaming dragon and eight ball bowling shirts, shredding in ripped up JNCO's with a halo made of the most perfectly spiked hair that has ever been waxed and/or gelled in this life and the next (truly, a duckbutted faux hawk crafted in god's own image).

169uds1,"I have these memories of Steve that for some reason always stayed with me. 

I remember watching him on this really awful reality TV show -

“The Surreal Life” season 6 with Tawny Kitaen and Florence Henderson. It was a terrible show with desperate ‘has-Beene’ a trying to make a buck and of course I watched it. It was oddly compelling, and he was one of the great parts of the show. 

He was trying to make a music video for a new song the band were coming out with and it seemed to me the whole reason he was on the show was to promote his band and the new album. 

So one of the show’s activities is to make a video for the new song. He leaves Tawny Kitaen in charge if I think like $3,000 for props for the music video. All the other Surreal Life celebs are going to shop for gear and be in the video. 

I always felt like the producers put her up to it but she like, didn’t let any of the other “stars” buy what they wanted. She kept shutting them down and let them buy a handful of props. When Steve shows up she’s like “look I save you $1,500” and he was incensed. 

It was for the music video and was meant to be spent to make it fun. They were out of time as the cameras and the space was all booked and now he had to shoot a video with only a few items. 

He was angry but over all, he dealt with it pretty well considering. They shot the video anyhow and all did the best they could. 

Then, in one of the last episodes, Florence Henderson —mom from
The Brady Bunch— had to give everyone “feedback.” 

And to this day, it’s still burned into my brain.   

Florence seemed really uncomfortable, it seemed really forced and out of no where she comes out with a deeply psychological take down on Steve. 

Throughout the whole series Steve was a complete standout. He was the most interesting guy on the show with the best chances of ever making it again. He was cool to everyone even though he was faced with all of these bizarre, contrived circumstances and challenges for the show. 

Florence proceeds to lay this really deep criticism on him inciuding that she thought he never dealt with the death of his son.

That was ever so briefly mentioned in an early episode, but it never came up again and there was no focus about it during the show. 

I couldn’t believe they did they too him and just really tried to dredge up and sensationalize the worst thing that ever happened to the guy. 

And I thought he dealt with it really well considering. I mean it was a clear tawdry attempt at antagonizing him and even though he was clearly mad, he didn’t lose it. He was more like incensed but “okay, fine.” 

That alone would have driven me to drink. 

I feel bad for the guy and appreciate the great vibes he brought into my life with his music. 

But for some reason, I never forgot those two moments from that series. When Tawny screws him over and when Florence confronted him with a deeply psychological take out of no where. Out of character with the spirit of the show. 

I feel bad for him. I hope he finds peace. ✌🏻",2023-09-04 18:10:56
169uds1,"Having watched people die from this, I quit drinking. Don’t get me wrong I love a good whiskey on a cold winter night and an ice cold light beer on a hot summer day.

But having seen certain people I knew leave this world with yellow skin and in agony - it ain’t worth it. 

If anyone reading this has been thinking of quitting as well - try drinking kombucha. I know it sounds silly but the feeling of a ice cold glass bottle really helped me cut it out of my life entirely. The mint flavor kinda taste like a boozy drink so that’s what I drank for months every weekend until I just stopped needing them.

Original comment:

&gt;get whats rightfully yours

There was NO GUARANTEE that that would be the result. 

&gt;this is a publicity stunt since she refused to sign an nda 

If she signed the nda and broke it, would you call that a publicity stunt too?

&gt;ONE FUCKING PERSON 

The ONLY OTHER PERSON THAT MATTERS IN THIS SITUATION. this isn't a random dude. 

&gt;remove genitalia and it's a business decision

I didn't say anything about sexism...? Weird that you'd bring it up 🤔

&gt;it's a poor business decision [...] to play the victim yet again 

It might've been someone else but..I thought you said 'playing victim sold records' and that's why she does it? I'm sorry, I'm confused. Is it a good business decision to play victim or not?

&gt;for someone who claims not to know much on this situation

I'm being honest in that I don't know much of this situation. I'm arguing more from philosophy here, because I feel like no matter what you're going to blame her. I feel like I know enough (as much as you, I bet!) To argue the point. 

&gt;feelings make bad business decisions 

I don't understand how ""feelings"" are relevant at all here. She wants her masters, he wants to extort her for them. 

&gt;she's making money off of it 

Which is totally wrong, but scooter extorting her to get her own masters is definitely not just to make money. /s

Executives at MTV thought it was cute and forwarded my letter to the band.  Fast forward 10 years, and the local band is one of the biggest in the world.  I randomly went into a jazz club in NorCal, and there was the lead singer of the band sitting at the bar by himself.  I summoned up the courage to say hi, and after a bit of conversation, he asked, ""Did you, by any chance, write to MTV about us in the early 80's?""  BOOM.  It was an awkward and embarrassing moment, but I look back now on it as super cool.  Believe, man, believe!  Hopefully it'll happen to you someday and you'll get to experience an inexplicably awesome moment too.  😊",2016-11-19 16:24:05

They closed the show out with “Didn't We Deserve a Look At You The Way You Really Are” from Terraform which wasn’t even out at the time so no one had a clue this one riff was going to test their patience for the next 10 mins or so 😂",2022-09-11 21:28:18
xbi604,"That's awesome!!!
The first time for me was on the Terraform tour and it was in a small place. I remember some girl upfront fucked with Bobs picking hand during “Didn't We Deserve a Look At You The Way You Really Are” and he just waited a few beats and went right back in like a pro. The thing that stood out to me when I saw that was he just kinda laughed when it happened and that was the first time I've ever seen an interaction like that at a show where the musician didn't become angry and kick that person out. Also it was awesome to see Bob just count a couple of ticks and was right back in that groove.

So I've seen them idk 5 or 6 times, pretty much every tour since Terraform. They ALWAYS do the question and answer thing. I love it and even had an incident on of the times they played, it was the 25th anniversary tour which consisted of 2 nights in Chicago and one night here ""Only because this is where Todd lives""😂
So anyway they were selling these shirts after the show that were for the 25th anniversary and when I finally got up to Bob to buy one, I think they were like $15 and I gave him a $20 and told him to keep the rest and he just said ""okay..."" in kinda a dickish way. So the next time they came around during one of the Q&A's I told the story of what had happened and when I said to Bob ""you were kind of a dick"" he said, ""yeah, that tracks"" and I think Albini said something similar but it was all in good fun and hilarious. That's the only time I've asked a question but yeah people ask them some dumb shit and it can be pretty funny. Those guys are clever as fuck.",2022-09-11 21:49:23

qh1h27,Hi Amy!  Do you plan to return to Latin America?  XOXO  🇦🇷🤍,2021-10-27 17:16:58
qh1h27,"Hey Amy! 

random question, I know, but will we ever get a chance to hear Your Love??? I've been keeping my fingers crossed for years 🤣 

also... the electronic elements introduced on the self-titled album, and which carried over to the TBT, are fascinating. is there any chance we'll ever hear a full blown electronic leaning album by Ev? or you? 

not a question, but... thank you for the beautiful music. it's meant and means the world to many of us, and it's a blessing to know it does to you too, still to this day! 

I got to see you in Puerto Rico some years back, for the self titled album era. thank you for giving me one of the best nights of my life! any chance you'll bless us PR folk with another show?",2021-10-27 17:21:17
qh1h27,"Good afternoon Amy, I can’t still see the first video that was released in the early 90’s! We were all so young🤓 I have followed your music ever since and truly has helped me through the roughest of times. To pick a song or album would be impossible for me honestly, I switch from week to week. Every piece of music you’ve ever sang that I can get my hands on I listen to at least once a week, it’s an addiction. Currently “A New Way to Bleed”, “My Heart is Broken” and “Broken Pieces Shine” have been played multiple times this week. My hope is the you play all three Dec 17th but the first two would be an unbelievable Christmas present to me. I’ll be 4th row center in awe as always. This upcoming concert will be #7 for me and I so can’t wait.",2021-10-27 17:46:19
qh1h27,"Hi Amy! First off, thank you for getting me trough a tough time. I became a fan a few days after tbt dropped and hearing the synthesis live version of the end of the dream made me realize I was going for the easy route and it made me decide I should follow my heart. It changed my life, so thank you! 

Now my questions: 
Any updates on a possible recover v.2 EP or any other solo projects coming up? 

How will the worlds collide tour work? Are you guys gonna make one setlist with WT and mix the songs up or are you gonna play two sets after eachother? Its gonna be my first concert of two bands performing together and I don't really know what to expect. So excited to see you and the band live tho, yay! 🥳
Also, any plans for a collab with them? 

Lastly I just wanna wish you all the happiness in the world! Good luck with the halestorm tour and have fun!",2021-10-27 18:12:26

I want to talk with you of course 💕❤️ I miss you so much . 

Here are some questions : 
First of all , How are you ? 

Will you record the song Your Love 💕? And will you make a music video for it too ? Please 🥺 please please ❤️❤️❤️

Have you thought about making a music video and re -record the song called Before the dawn ? (It's my favorite song by you with Evanescence) maybe it's hard to re - sing because of the end note 🥺❤️ 

Would you like to sing a Björk cover of one song ? I think you said Joga  ? One day  (from debut ) ? Or come to me ? 

Would you like to record a acustic album ?
Would you like to record a Acapella album ?

Please record the adventure song please please . 
And the video please 🥺 please ❤️❤️😘❤️
Will happen  happening , happened.. ❤️❤️❤️😘

A Love song album ? ❤️❤️❤️ Just because i love 💕 when you sing ballads, even thou i love when you sing hard rock songs too.. 🤟😎❤️ 

If you want to record Recover 2 , will you make a DVD with music videos for recover and recover 2? 

Ok so this was some questions. 

I Love You Amy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Part of me is glad this happened... 

The other part of me is absolutely gutted that people in my country are maniacs.

45 definitely would have been a dictator or another Hitler if we didn’t have the Constitution and brave people to stop him.... THANK GOD.

The sad part is that 45 Orchestrated this event at the Capitol, promised his WORSHIPPERS HE WOULD BE THERE WITH THEM... Then didn’t show up!

Also, because of 45’s manipulation of his followers, 2 Military Veterans lost their life. (

A Lady who supported him and a Police Officer who tried to stop them) 

45 is EVIL.... Plain and Simple.

But then again, it’s the people who follow him that gives him the power 😒😞 

These people claim to be Christians, Pro America and Pro Police, but they did the opposite of that. What a shame.

9tb72d,"The mall is cool, for sure. It's a bit controversial, or at least it used to be because the church preaches one thing, like abstinence from alcohol, but there's plenty of restaurants where you can get served. I know some members claim Victoria's secret to be pornography (laughable, I know) but then they have those stores too. 

The mall is originally what sparked my interest in finding out more about how the church works, because I learned that they've spent over 2 billion on the project so far... and if you're a Mormon and go down that rabbit hole, let's just say there's a lot in the history that they just don't teach you in Sunday school. If you read the original church history books, you'd think it was anti Mormon propaganda because you're taught a completely different narrative.

I think you can say: very nice AND weird 😁",2018-11-02 05:01:19
9tb72d,"I am 100% down for being open to the latest music. Every generation of music had the select few that would ruin it in the older folks’ eyes and have their offspring suffer for it by hearing their parents complain about it being “bad.” I don’t want to be that dad. Because it’s new, and new can be scary. I do have to say though, some of these “rappers” today are only in it for tabloids and publicity. It sucks because there’s other potential talent out there that’s being pushed aside for this new image of hip hop. The real artists are staying out of that spotlight. 

Anyways, I love doowop, 50’s music. Something about La Bamba struck me when I was a kid. Like a plane. 🤔 
Also 70s/80s funk. That’s my shiiieet",2018-11-02 04:37:28

First of all Congrats on doing the fantastic TT30 UK tour. Saw you at O2 London and it was superb. 
My questions are:
1. After the success of your 2016 album 50 how did you cope with Beautiful Life not going to No. 1 (eventhough I personally also loved the latter album!) 
2. You come across as an artist that doesn't want to slow down, is touring a lot, going to festivals  and is just super busy. What motivates you still making music? And do you think there will come a point when you say ok, that's it I can retire now? 🙂

You know, some of us can separate issues and see thing for what it is.   As I said before on here, he is guilty as fuck in my opinion.   However having dyslexic and being unable to read his own contract/signing off his own publishing rights is sad for any artist. I am dyslexic but hold down a career. To see the condition I have affect people to the point where they've made decision they probably wouldn't have made is sad. It is something I wouldn't wish on anyone. 

I have no sympathy for him because of the charges levelled against him but because thing are in a sad state for him/his kids/wife and who ever who may have wanted him him to do well or have faith in him.

The amount of innovation this time around is truly miraculous. I’ll find out in a couple of weeks if we got it all, but I’m feeling great. Which I couldn’t say when I was 3 weeks out from completing chemo 😂

Also, fuck cancer. But I think it’s important for newly diagnosed people to see that some of us do win, and if you want to/can fight, it’s worth trying. We don’t all win, but every day the tools we have to fight with get better.",2023-01-01 14:55:01

I don't disagree that Kpop companies are way too controlling, I just also know that this goes back way, way farther.  Korea has a long way to go but they HAVE taken steps to protect the artists from slave contracts and underage idols from being overworked.

A lot of artists actually make a decent living writing songs for their groups and for other groups/solo artists.  See Soyeon from G-Idle and LE from EXID.

Hell, think about the Spice Girls and what they were forced to do/be, under the guise of Girl Powaaaa! 

Don't get me wrong, I still love me some Spice Girls; this just isn't and never has been a Kpop specific problem.  I think Kpop is just popular now and we are all becoming more aware of what really goes into all of this.

I said you just missed them, they went across the street to trump plaza since it's slow here and he said, well I'm going where the hoes are at lol. He clapped me up and told me peace out and I told him to be safe. I calmly walk back inside and take a seat, then these two prostitutes walk up and start asking about biz.

I was never really into either group (owing to my older brother I got into rock/metal at an early age), but there's no denying that they were everywhere back then!

Likewise Aaron Carter, I don't remember him having the fame that BSB and NSync did but I do remember hearing his music frequently. He can't have lived an easy life, and I hope he can find the peace that he couldn't find in this life.",2022-11-06 10:22:02

I had to buy it because my dad kept yelling at me to put his back, because it always lived in my portable CD player that I would listen to in bed. 😂 The CD player was a gift from my dad, who has always been a big audiophile, and DJed for most of the mid/late 70s and early 80s. I would sneak CDs out of his collection pretty regularly (just the disc, leaving the case in it's proper place) and listen to them when I was supposed to be sleeping. I eventually had to buy my own Yellow Submarine, Foreigner's ""4,"" and many others. Pretty sure he gave me an allowance just so I could buy CDs of my own. 🤣

Pew Research for instance on their Muslim page has polling as current as 2016 with pretty different numbers. Citing a poll from 2006 or 2007 kind of takes credibility from argument. Updating sources with more current numbers will aid your arguments better 👌",2017-05-23 02:38:15

fyph8x,"I became a fan too recently (2016) and back then i thought it would never see you live or i would see the release of a new the strokes album, pleased to tell my younger self I was very wrong. 

Ok, I have so many random questions, specially after watching the 5guys thing (which btw I think it’s brilliant!! Whoever had that idea deserves the world). If you can answer any of this I’ll take it as my early birthday present :D 

1) Which was the first song that written for TNA? I’ve read/heard that the process started as early as 2017 but I’m curious to know if any of these songs were written previously or there was any kind of sketch already made. 

2) What’s your favourite song on the album? 

3) Are we gonna see Albert’s car interview trailer?? I get the footage is basically lost, why not recreate it when this is over? 😜 it would be a hit! 

4) Have you picked up any new/old hobbies during this strange period of time? Books you can recommend? Series? Movies? 

5) I’ve been talking with some friends (both hardcore fans and casual listeners) and the general consensus is that the whole album feels strangely fitting to the current times. It’s filled with nostalgia but of the immediate times, not the old memories. I know you named the album because of the California fires but what do you think it all feels a bit prophetic?

Much love forever!!!! Can’t wait to see you again please take care!",2020-04-10 22:08:46
fyph8x,"I've got nothing to say.

Just kidding, there are so many things I want to ask but I'll keep it short and chill, I'd be happy if you answered at least one of them.

Before I get into that I want to thank you guys for existing, I've been listening to you since I was in middle school and I'm in my mid 20s now. Your music has always been there; through good times, bad times, helping me feel happier about being here and now. Yesterday my best friend and I were listening to your pirate radio thing, and you have no idea how your new album lifted our spirits in the midst of these strange times. 

Thanks for boosting my immune system haha.

Not music related questions (it seems like you already got asked some good ones):

▪(When it's safe) are you guys ever coming to AZ? 
▪What are your favorite chocolates/candies?
▪Do you play any online games or videogames?
▪Any advice for people in their 20s?

P.S. Stay safe, love you all.",2020-04-10 22:00:04

It wouldnt. surprise me at all that he’s rapey and psychologically abusive.

Still, he holds a dear place in my heart, just for his exhibitionist lifestyle and his intellect matches my own.

y1zenn,"I mean, I’ll record parts of or the entirety of my favorite songs, but that doesn’t mean I’m not gonna dance and sing along at the same time. I recorded nearly an entire show once because I paid hella money to be there and the album got me through some of my hardest years.

My videos usually turn out shaky, but the audio is usually great so I go back and watch them back fairly often. (Plus I’m short af so I usually can’t see and everyone can see over me anyway)

Going to concerts has been my favorite hobby for the last decade, and they’re some of my favorite memories. I’m not gonna not capture that moment cause I’m worried someone is gonna judge me for it 🤷🏻‍♀️",2022-10-13 01:56:44

I had a girl in front of me recently recording the whole show so I was effectively watching the show through  her camera.

y1zenn,"I don't know about you but when I record I am watching the show live at the same time. I typically will record my fav songs not the entire show. 

Sometimes we want to remember and save the moment. Isn't that why we all demand our phones have cameras on them? 

What's the point in snapping photos and videos? 

Not everyone is recording the whole show but here's the thing: it's their loss not yours. They paid for their ticket you didn't spend a cent on their ticket so what does it matter. 

How about you take a bit of your own advice and focus on the show and not those around you 😃",2022-10-12 12:45:31

I struggle to think of any way someone recording a show to post on social media could disturb you in a way that justifies you saying they look like “a fuCkInG MorOn you kidS these daysssss” 😂. “Who the fuck is going to watch it” like you haven’t seen someone celebrate something they’re excited about by sharing it on social media.

y1zenn,"You’re wrong.
But I used to feel the same way…

At Rammstein a couple of weeks ago, I had shitty seats in the back but EVERYONE was recording and the phones lit up and changed color of the stage and it actually added to the show.
Plus when I got home I could watch all my personal camera persons perspectives.

It just what happens now🤷‍♂️",2022-10-12 12:15:48

y1zenn,I totally disagree!! I agreed with this one upon a time.. Now tho I'm not only thankful someone would record it  but then post where I can watch. I can't go to shows now so I really am grateful to see someone else's experience it's all I need bc it's all I can take.. So ty to my ppl u know who you are.. And you should've say anyone looks stupid for filming their experience what an ass thing to say. They can't be that stupid your at the same show. Let them do whatever makes them happy if it's not bothering you. Maybe.. don't get angry so quickly.. Say.. fuck depression..😏,2022-10-12 19:11:47

When two of us were seeing Journey, we FaceTimed our other sister who was happy to enjoy the moment with us. It’s less about the quality of the performance and just sharing good vibes. I am also the type to record more than most, but that’s just a solution to my poor memory, and I am hyper-conscious of not disturbing other’s experience.

y1zenn,"The fact is, at the Audioslave concert I mentioned above, Chris was actually super fucking psyched about the fact that everyone there had phones! In fact if you go to the video at the 1:05:48 mark just before he starts the encore he says the following “Everybody - I want to see everyone at Madison square garden to take out your cell phone and aim it at me. Take it out - that’s badass. This is modern times - this is modern times, this is right now! Thats amazing looking - truly! I wonder if I was the first one to ever do this? I’m like Bill Shatner!

Regardless on whether or not they need to work on their backbone if you're trying to give some real world advice/criticism to help them toughen up you didn't respect the nonverbal medium of communication and certainly didnt care to make sure it was understood that way.

Then you mix in personal attacks about my literacy and cognitive abilities.

Is this how you handle anyone that criticises you? Hell, even my criticism was intended to be light handed with ""Yar might be an asshole"" as I was giving you the benefit of the doubt while also performing the role of contrarian before anyone else could.

I responded with I didnt know you were joking and your next response has another attack on my character. I mean, ok?

After considering all this I'm rather content with my earlier offhand speculation. It seems it was rather accurate.

What have you to say? Are you going to latch onto something and try to hang onto that low hanging fruit until you feel better about the exchange, see we're arguing about miscommunication and we both meant well, or something I don't anticipate... 🤔",2021-06-21 17:22:58

**She sold a million and a half fuckin records in 4 months**

People who fizzle out after their “strong debuts” typically have a hard time going gold with said debut,

You don’t have such a wildly successful release that your label doesn’t even bother to request it be certified Platinum cause they figure it’s going to be double Platinum before the end of the year and it’s cheaper to just wait for that and knock out two birds with one stone for a cheaper price... and then just *fizzle out.*

There are plenty of musician millionaires who’ve never played for more than 2000 people outside of festivals, coheadliners, and being an opening act.

You also don’t need a record label to promote you or create social media buzz. There are plenty of multipurpose PR/Marketing Firms that take on independent musicians as clients. All she needs is the ability to book small local venues, a CD Baby account, a team of adults willing to risk their careers to help her manage it all (you could even call them a “manager”), and some willingness to spend some of her own cheese to make it happen - and she’ll be set.

v5z7r1,"Grunge. Vaporwave, especially utopian virtual. Geocities clusterfuck visions of the internet, before anyone really had AOL. Trapper Keeper and aggressively tasteless CGI. Unironic edgelord nonsense where video games insulted their customers. MTV sliding from their 80s reputation to Gen-X animation to zero-effort reality TV. 

The 90s were a grace period between the end of the Cold War and admitting the reality of modern terrorism. There were bombings and shootings aplenty, and several foreign wars in the usual places, but we told ourselves those events were now the exceptions, right up until Columbine and 9/11. The actual economy was doing fantastically well. The fake economy was doing even better, especially via the dot-com bubble. 

It's no surprise this was the decade Fukuyama declared ""The End Of History."" We figured, western democracy won, it's all uphill from here, I guess we're safe forever. That was *always* a lie. This was when Newt Gingrich, Rupert Murdoch, Rush Limbaugh, and a hundred other indefensible bastards really got their start. But back then - we still figured access to information and The Free Marketplace Of Ideas™ would *prevent* hatred and misinformation. That suburban optimism is the soul of the 1990s. 

So musically, endless bombastic production. Ace Of Base, Bjork, early Foo Fighters, late Genesis, Matchbox 20, Beck, Aerosmith circa ""Livin' On The Edge"" to ""Don't Wanna Miss A Thing."" The Red Hot Chili Peppers for their first Frusciante hiatus. Jesus Christ, Smash Mouth. ""Sugar Ray ironically popular yet?"" Chumbawamba for the one song people know, Alanis Morisette's *Jagged Little Pill* for any song except the one fucking song people know, Sarah McLachlan's ""Adia,"" and entirely too much pop-country as ClearChannel bought all the goddamn radio stations. Jimmy Eat World before they got kicked off their label and did *Bleed American* just to show them what-for. 

Artificial saccharine pop like the Spice Girls, Britney Spears, and every formulaic boy band you can name. Radiohead sliding from clever pop to disaffected rock and roll. The Cranberries, RIP Dolores. ""Alternative"" as a catch-all for thoughtful not-quite-grunge-or-metal acts: Bush, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, the Goo Goo Dolls, the Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day, The Offspring. Self-awareness eating itself until Weird Al became a genuinely respected musician. 

""Techno"" in all its various forms, back when making music on a computer was still novel. Massive Attack, Prodigy, Moby, The Crystal Method. Those Depeche Mode albums nobody talks about even though *Songs Of Faith & Devotion* is why people fuck musicians. Every dork styling themselves ""DJ [Noun]."" 

Commercial rap took off, and not all of it was awful garbage: The Beastie Boys, Jay-Z... that's all I got. I don't listen to rap. 

Arguably that throwaway joke is illustrative of a cultural shift: this might've been when subcultures ceased to matter. Where everything had one distinct genre, and every genre had a discrete fandom, and being ""a Sega kid"" meant treating the objects your family bought like your local sports team. This was also the decade Ellis predicted with ""American Psycho."" 

The backlash against that consumerism was also packaged and commercialized in the performative angst of post-thrash, like industrial and nu-metal. Korn's first album went hard. KMFDM needs no defense. White Zombie. *Around The Fur.* Marilyn Manson back when he was detested for all the wrong reasons. Everlast for late-90s misery porn, and House Of Pain for early-90s endless partying, because that's the same guy. 

Actual heavy shit still doing it right, and getting way less air time because of it. Alice In Chains. Pantera. Ministry. Soundgarden. Tool. Strapping Young Lad. Rammstein breaking out in the US with their okayest song. The Slayer and Metallica albums nobody really loves. (And the Meshuggah albums nobody listened to, but if I went into what pop culture missed out on, I'd hit the character limit. Though somehow everyone's come around on Neutral Milk Hotel?) 

And a well-made fiction about this era would pair all that neon irony with the alleged protagonists singling out a gay kid and beating him to death.",2022-06-06 17:21:13

81efrj,"I'll explain it as consicely as I can. It's a show about existentialism. Don is a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks who just wanted the American Dream™. He believed it would make him happy and let him find his place in the world his own little ""chicken farm."" To do so he cheats his way to the top because it's all he knows. He stole an army Bud's identity, lied his way into the ad man job, and bullshitted his way to the top.

Now he's rich, has a hot wife, healthy kids, nice car and home in the burbs. He made it...except he's not happy and he doesn't know why. So he looks for happiness in other women and lots of drinking. Still...nothing.

The life he thought he wanted was just a dream (lie) sold to him by American society and the capitalist culture it's made of. So what happens at the end? He seems to join the hippie counterculture movement and it's a fantastic ending for him, but then you see the Coke ad.

That ad is there because Don made that fucking ad himself. He turned the counterculture against itself by making it part of the capitalist culture, he made hippies marketable. Why did he do this? Because he's damn good at it and it's all he's ever known, and because he's afraid. Afraid of losing his made up life, afraid of commitment, and afraid of straying from the norm because his entire made up life is the norm set by the American Dream™. While he thinks he's the one running the show and telling the masses what to do, he's the greatest target of advertisment.",2018-03-02 19:50:33

10hszzl,"Serious question, does the rainbow on the original cover only have 6 colours?

The pride flag has 6, rather than 7, and I'm not sure whether indigo or violet is missing, but the two colour schemes do seem awfully similar. 

I'm presuming that the LGBTIQ+ community adopted the 6-colour rainbow after TDSOTM came out.

I mean, the conservative response is both hilarious, and somewhat saddening, but if the two patterns are the same it might make some sense that their pea brains recognise it as the pride flag.

For the record, Pink Floyd are amazing, the LGBTIQ+ community and their allies are amazing, and even if Pink Floyd were showing explicit support for the community I'd still be 100% behind it.

Never got the chance y’all 😭😭😭

He was someone that struggled in society (prison time for assault charges) and it was always one thing after another beating him down like losing his grandma last year and his dad to a heart attack a year or two earlier.

But me and him clicked so well because we were both struggling to find our place in life and society gave up on him but I didn’t. I always treated him with respect and uplifted him with positivity throughout the negativity.

This is the link from the first comment: https://www.ascap.com/~/media/files/pdf/advocacy-legislation/political_campaign.pdf

Before I go on, I am a professional musician, I have my music licensed with ASCAP, and I have worked with them many times before. ASCAP, if you haven’t heard of it, is the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers. It is the largest licensing group in the US, and it very nearly governs the law on how licensing works in America. It at least determines how licensing works for all of their composers, which is 95% of all modern musicians. With that background:

The link is an FAQ by ASCAP about how licensing ASCAP musicians’ music works in political campaigns. It is targeted at both the campaigns, and musicians. 

Since it is written by ASCAP, this FAQ was written by **literally**, and I mean ***literally***, the same people who wrote the rules regarding how ASCAP musicians’ music is to be played.

You *cannot* find a better source on the subject, because this is an FAQ written by the people who wrote the contracts that everyone signs.

Now, if you want to keep your position about it being a fake source, you have to provide something better. Trust me when I say, “you’re not gonna”.",2020-07-30 06:33:55

Naming of a band can mean different things to the members versus the fans. Fans can run off with idea left and right, shit just look at Rage Against the Machine or System of a Down fans.

What’s happened in the US recently was clearly enough for them to rethink their past and make a statement. THAT is exactly the type of racism that’s plaguing the country! Those little, seemingly innocent moments/decisions where many don’t even realize the transgression. Intentions can be entirely wholesome, but it’s the type of thing that once you see it, you can’t ignore it.

Especially given their southern-leaning audience, this is a really good signal to be sending. Not even a fan of their music, but I’m a huge fan of the statement ✊🏻🖤",2020-06-11 20:10:13

she asked me to rap on it, but @Steve_G_Lover is a better rapper...so ----‍♂️

— donald (@donaldglover) November 6, 2020
While he had everyone's attention Glover hyped the upcoming seasons of 'Atlanta,' which he said can only be topped by 'The Sopranos'.

while im here: 'atlanta' s3+s4 are going to be some of the best television ever made. sopranos only ones who can touch us.

— donald (@donaldglover) November 6, 2020
Filming for the show has been delayed in 2020 and is set to resume in early 2021. It was renewed for more seasons back in the summer of 2018.

Glover also has been at work on the follow-up to 2018's hit singles ""This Is America,"" ""Summertime Magic"" & ""Feels Like Summer"" presumably still under the name Childish Gambino.

last music project was probably my best. but the one coming will be my biggest by far.

listen to ""new ancient strings"" outside.

— donald (@donaldglover) November 6, 2020
It seems like we can expect some big things in 2021 from the busiest man in show business.

there is a lot (of magic) comin. yall thought i was hot in 2018.

fmamkk,"**Kenny Rogers was a true country legend. I was so sad to hear of his passing. Such a handsome bear of a man who always sang with such passion and emotion. He had so many great hits through the years. In fact, his Greatest Hits album was iconic in my home since I was a kid. I used to play it constantly, thinking he had Four Hundred Children and a crop in the field. My Mother would say *""Four Hungry, Hungry Children. Nobody has Four Hundred children ya dope!""* [Rude. lol!]  Love The Gambler, Ruby, Reuben James, Coward of the county, etc. I learned most those songs on guitar & piano & would sing my little heart out! Probably helped me develop the raspy-esque, soulful singing voice that I still have to this day. I lit a candle and have been playing his music in his honor since I heard the sad news. Me and The Dude are just dancing around to *""I Just Dropped in, To See What Condition My Condition Was in...""* He was just such a sweetheart and his voice was so distinctive. He sounded like nobody else. So Pure & yet gravelly whiskey soaked all at the same time. I hope that he had the honor of dying in his sleep; cause Somewhere in the darkness, Kenny broke way more than even. Thank you so much for the memories and the music cowboy. You decorated *OUR* lives and you will truly be missed. RIP** 💖",2020-03-22 12:04:53

The one-two punch of Moving in Stereo & All Mixed Up moved me to literal tears! I've never listened to those songs the same way again... completely over shadowing that Pheobe Cates scene in my mind lol. 
Still with that woman today...and I miss that apartment.

TBH I do think 16 should be the national AOC in my country but keep 18 for other purposes (e.g. You still can't disown a child outside of Dore circumstances) . It gives you a few years to experience making your choices but also a few years (usually) under guidance of your parents before you whisk away to college or work life. That would include the ability to have partners that a parent can advise on.

ul0yzq,"I get what you're saying, but I generally see that they're not for the person making music, they're for the person listening.

Indulge me.

Are they perfect? No. But on a broad level they're useful for helping people find what they like. 

Very few people would regularly go to a club that plays Rihanna one minute, Napalm Death the next, and chases that up with some Venetian Snares.

As much as people say they ""like a bit of everything"" and ""don't fit into a box"", they generally do. Knowing it's an RnB night, a rock & metal bar, or a jazz club helps you know what you're likely to get.

I agree, they might not work for some ultra niche acts, but I've lost count of how many musicians/artists I knew who said ""my music doesn't really fit a genre"" but then a quick skim through their songs and it's super obvious they have pretty standard elements of 1-2 relatively well understood genres.

I'd postulate that actually just saying ""We're a funk band for people who like country music"" is more useful for the artists and will lure in far more people who will enjoy them than ""try this, you be the judge"".

Will it risk missing out on those who don't like funk or country, but may end up liking the band? Sure. But a vague invite to try some band you don't know is far less appealing.

People don't have the time to sift through the hundreds of major label tracks released every week, let alone the thousands of independent ones. Knowing ROUGHLY what stuff is going to sound like helps get it to the people who will actually want to hear more, buy some merch, or come to a show.

I have lost a lot of money learning these lessons, assuming people were willing to have tastes as eclectic as mine 😅",2022-05-08 16:14:53
ul0yzq,💀,2022-05-08 18:27:26
ul0yzq,"It's definitely hit and miss.

Which isn't a criticism, but one person's pick of unknown songs out of a wide mix of genres isn't going to chime with everyone.

I used to listen to a lot of local/independent music for work (radio+music journalism, bit of concert promotion), hundreds of songs a week. Some artists with sub-1000 listens deserve so many more, but the harsh truth is that most don't.*

The 0.1% you find that are a cut above make it all worth it though. I've found two or three on this playlist I like, which is a better batting rate than 0.1% 😃

They swamp as many outlets as they can and over stimulate our senses with pictures, sounds, words of persuasion...etc, until we are forced to believe someone is famous. I guarantee Spotify is aware of this, as well as Drake and his associates, and they wouldn't care or stop unless their money is in danger.

LP is so unique; forming its own genre, it doesn't just fall a ""rock band"". Chester had these smooth, passionate, soothing vocals that was so uniquely, yet fluidly, raw and propelling at the same time. You just transcend when you put on your headphones, heck, even without headphones!

I shouldn't have to explain to anyone why his death affects me or keep it quiet to avoid ridicule. Chester and Linkin Park have been a part of my life ever since my son was born and he used to sing all of Hybrid Theory with me when we'd commute around So-Cal when he was little... he's 17 now and still gets excited when LP comes on the radio.

Read that lol

""At 2am I decided to take a bath 🛁 !!!! I got a new scented lotion from Victoria’s Secret and I wanted to wear it because it helps me sleep better !!!!  I went to the bathroom and looked at my leftover coffee from earlier in the morning and said “gross” but didn’t throw it away and then I looked for my face wash but couldn’t find it anywhere !!!! I was caught up in my head looking for it for about 15 minutes and then realized it’s probably in the other bathroom … then I went to leave and the door was locked 🔒 … I thought ok well it’s a bathroom, I can open the damn door 🚪 … no, the lock was stuck !!!! I got locked in the fucking bathroom and my boyfriend was sleeping  😴 … even if there are earthquakes he doesn't wake up 😂🙄😬 !!! I screamed “HEYYYYY!!!! Come open this stupid door !!!!” …. silence … the fourth time he gets up and says “What’s wrong?” ... I said “I’m in here and I can’t get out 😂😂😂😒😒😒 !!!!  He tried to do his thing to open the door with a PEN ✒️ … so I got my phone and called security to tell them to open the door 🚪 … 15 minutes went by and they finally said they’d send someone up to open the door … 10 minutes later …. “HELLO ??? Is anybody there ???” … then they told me 10 more minutes !!! I cleaned the bathroom and thought about taking a shower or something but then I saw it … the door 🚪 … I just looked at it for the first time with a yearning of just wanting it to open … would my eyes trick me and make it happen faster ??? My eyes widened and the door was more clear … more vast … I could see it with clarity and brightness … please open door 🚪 !!!! “We’re here!” They said … I asked how long it would take to open … and they said ""oh, maybe 10 minutes"" !!!! The old coffee I had left over from the morning was there … I started feeling foggy 😶‍🌫️ so I drank it ... I was reenergized and started speaking again!!! “Are you guys there ???” … “Yes we are!” They said, “Stand back, we’re going to open the door!” It opened … it finally opened !!!!!""",2021-08-13 03:30:43

We had done nada, nunca, but I could not take a left on a main street that had no median to pause. It was just like try your luck! I wrecked my first little shitty Golf that night.

I remember one of the last times I saw her, I was 12, and she was just so different. She was a scientist, and it killed her to be the way she was. 

Once she passed, my Grandfather got very old, very quickly, and it was just a very strange experience. She's still one of my biggest inspirations, and she was such an amazing woman. Cherish every moment, I promise you, you'll thank yourself ❤️",2018-01-23 11:25:13

Like, imagine you’re at your friends house, and they make you sit through a 9 MINUTE AND 17 SECOND music video that you didn’t really wanna watch in the first place. 9 minutes is an eternity! But:

 “oh you gotta watch it! Oh you’ve never seen it? Oh dude I can’t believe you’ve never seen it! No just watch the whole thing and I promise you’ll get it! Seriously, sshhhh! Pay attention....OMG I LOVE THIS PART! But shh! Just watch! It’s great right? You get it right!? I need SO MUCh validation!!!!!!”

I feel like most of us can relate. We’ve either been this person or have known this person. It’s awkward to say the least. Uncomfortable as hell! You’re completely uninterested but someone will make you sit through a 12 minute Pink Floyd song cause they think that they can make you like it. Now imagine the person doing this to you is Donald Trump and you’re in the Oval Office....🤦‍♀️

Im a huge Pink Floyd fan for the record. Seen roger waters several times.

7uwabx,"> Let's be honest, that feeling was the magic of the open world, the unknown, the endless possibilities... 

This is for me the thing that happens in every game with exploration elements. Most recently, I remember feeling that magical awe in Breath of the Wild when my imagination would run wild and try to envision all of the possibilities and wondrous things I would discover. But once I had explored all that the game had to offer, that magical wonder was gone and it can never return since there is nothing left for my imagination to dream up. ☹️

So when someone’s role model, or a musician (or any pop-culture celebrity) of whom they respect does the same thing they are afraid of doing, it can make that person feel better and more confident - ultimately giving them the courage to finally be themselves and make their “true self” public.

7769r4,"I just posted this elsewhere, but this sucks.  Just one of many memories I have of the man and the band. 😪

I got to do a lot of fun and awesome things when I was working at CFNY.  Both Jamie and Phil let me attend and work so many concerts, trade shows and parties that it was an amazing experience for me in my late teens, early 20’s.  One of those events was the 1990 Canada Day concert at Molson Park.  The Box were the headliners, but The Tragically Hip were second billing.  Up To Here had exploded over the past year and the band was on a roll.  During their performance, I got to sit side stage with Alan Cross, Don Burns and Martin Streek.  It was unreal to say the least.  For the final song of the night, the band was playing New Orleans Was Sinking and during some of Gord’s ramblings, he started to take his boots off at the front of the stage.  
After singing at his boots for a little while he  walked off stage and grabbed a bottle of lighter fluid.  He then proceeded to light his boots on fire and sing at them as well.  The crowd was going bonkers by this point and I was just soaking in the charisma and showmanship Gord Downie possessed and did till today.  An amazing Canadian, an amazing human.  My heartfelt condolences to his family, his bandmates and crew and to all that loved this man and his band.  May he rest in peace.",2017-10-18 15:37:36
7769r4,"I woke up to the news and instantly started crying. The Hip was a band my father, uncle and aunts used to listen to together. We sang the songs loudly and nobody couldn't not join in. 
I'm glad he was at peace when standing beside death. RIP Gord. 😞",2017-10-18 17:36:35
7769r4,What can I say. The Hip are Canada & we are them. I have always been extremely proud of these boys. Their music is the soundtrack to so many great memories. Gordie was Canada's lead singer. We knew this was coming but we all hoped it wouldn't. All the best to the Downie family & we can never repay the Tragically Hip for what they have given to all of us.

Maybe that’s it....

I’m from the US, in one of those “border states” where they did have a bit of a following - even could have seen them in much smaller venues than they play up there. Lots of you guys would make the drive down.

Every time I listened I just said “I don’t get it....”. 

Northern Pikes, Corb Lund, April Wine, Moist, Gowan.....Great Big Sea....but for some reason TH always eluded me. Being 3 hours from the border must not make me Canadian enough. 😉",2017-10-18 14:53:16

I know their recent music is shit. There is never a band who has produced all 10 albums with innovative music.

I am hoping you have listened to their first 3-4 albums. At that time in 2000 they were absolutely innovative and fresh.

You find them repetitive and boring because what *they* came up with became mainstream today.

The entire indie pop genre is basically multiple variations of coldplay and radiohead.

Coldplay were extremely good. Not just good, *extremely* good.

It's sad that they fell for this shit music. But every band in history has sold it's soul 🙂

**Edit**: 
I am not saying that they are the greatest band ever. All I am saying is that they were very good and the quality dropped.

Charlie was more a Stone than Brian Jones, Bill Wyman or Ronnie Wood. Nearly 60 years. 

I’ve seen them play several times since I was a kid in big stadiums as well as smaller clubs. My mum and dad used to watch them at the old Lewisham Odeon in South London. My mum even worked at the same advertising agency as Charlie and bumped into them several times during the 60’s. Charlie reportedly would always be a quiet presence, but a friendly one by all accounts. 

He did smack Mick Jagger for calling Charlie “his drummer” though 😂

apfff6,"Imo, the reason this is happening is due to billboard and music media forcing out rock. Look up the top 50 rock songs of 2018. Most of the songs are from bands like TOP, Panic! At the Disco, Portugal the Man, etc. I view a band like Foo Fighters and Red Hot Chili Peppers as plain old, vanilla Rock and Roll. But billboard and others group them under hard rock and these pop/""alt"" rock bands are moved ""up"" (in a scale where higher up is a harder subgenre) a tier. Nothing's wrong with the pop rock bands, but it's forcing the various rock subgenres to consolidate and absorb other subgenres. So instead of a hard rock station playing Korn, Slipknot, and ""up"" they now have to play Pearl jam, Soundgarden, and Foo Fighters in between A7X and Disturbed. That's if you're lucky enough to have a hard rock station outside of Octane on satellite. Now there's this weird cognitive dissonance amongst rock fans because suddenly Green Day is called Hard Rock by the music industry when it was barely Alt Rock when they started. I don't think Rock will die in the next few decades. There are a lot of new bands still holding on to the genre's roots, but I'm not a fan of how it's evolving in the industry's hands. Google Play and Spotify do a good job of linking smaller bands that sound like whatever band you search up. As long as apps like those keep doing that, there may be a chance.

8hdaru," To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand This is America. The message is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of modern day society most of the ideas will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Gambino’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation\- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these ideas, to realise that they're not just thoughts\- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike This is America truly ARE idiots\- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the message in Gambino's existential catchphrase ""This is America,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hiro Murai's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a This is America tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only\- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own \(preferably lower\) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2018-05-14 10:36:46

7xz5ub,"Op, I'm just curious:

Are you listening on a turn table with maybe an EQ and pre-amp, etc? (In other words classic stereo equipment?) Or are you listening on more modern equipment (Compact Disc, and DA converter, and amp, etcetera?)

I'm far from being an audio *snob* but I am totally *in love with music.* I just like to chat about what kind of equipment a person likes to listen to, and what music they like to listen to. Anyone who is overtly moved by music such as Pink Floyd could easily be someone who could trade notes on audio stuff. 😀

Anyways, since you're a fan, let me encourage you to look up Dire Straits and separately Mark Knopfler's YouTube channel for some taste testing. I have a hunch you might be moved by *something* you find there. Dire Straits goes back MANY years, their lead singer Mark went solo in more recent years. I hope you will find much more music that will resonate with you. Here's to good music! Cheers! ",2018-02-17 02:16:47
7xz5ub,"As a freshman in college, I wrote a paper on ""Another Brick in the Wall"" parts 1-3, discussing the music and associated imagery in the movie, dissecting the meaning (the assign.ent was to choose a piece of art that requires you to look beneath the surface, read between the lines, etc. and do so).

Not only did I get an A on the paper, the professor told me she wished I hadn't been out sick for the previous class because she had anonymized my paper and passed it out to the rest of the class as an example of how the assignment should have been done.

I had the opportunity to watch Rogers show live a few years ago, and I have bought the DVD, and the a live edition digipack. This record ""The wall"" was, is and will be my all time favorite. I've been listening to it for more 25 years and never get bored. I'm in love with ""Run like hell"". A cob driver suggested me to listen the Pulse concert. It is supposed to be the band's best one.

7xz5ub,"In case you don't know, they released a live recording of it. ""Is there anybody out there"". Honestly, I almost threw out my original recording once I got the live one. Roger Waters cut so much of the rest of the band from the studio album. There's keyboard solos, jams, and more. The longer version of young lust is worth it alone, and just before David Gilmour kicks into his solo in it, you hear Roger yell off mic ""get down Dave!""

I'm gonna have to dig that album out now! 

Oh and all that being said, go grab Animals. Not only is it hands drown my favorite pink Floyd, it's one of my all time favorite albums, and Pigs (three different ones) might just be one of my favoritest songs ever. Then of you want a live version of that you'll have to look up Les Claypool's Flying Frog Brigade 🤓",2018-02-17 07:04:44

There aren’t a ton of things I remember when I was a teenager. But seeing My Name Is for the first time on TRL on MTV is one of them. I’m in my room and I see this white dude rapping and my first thought was “oh no, here’s some shitty vanilla ice wanna be”. then I kept listening and it was funny and clever and I was like damn. This dude actually pretty good. The next day at school we were all talking about Eminem. From then on my fandom grew. My love for hip hop grew. I had already been listening to puff daddy, bone thugs n harmony, Jay-z, cash money and all that. But the way Em was rapping just made those other guys look like they needed to catch up to this white boy who just came through and stole the show. Then MMLP came out and Em took the crown from whoever had it. And held that bitch for a long long long time. 

My all time favs are Jay, 2pac, BIG, Cole, Kendrick, and Logic. But Em is the GOAT to me. 🐐 👑 ",2019-02-23 20:02:09

You put a cape on and stand on a soapbox w some false sense of moral superiority, telling people what they should be ashamed of doing not even realizing that you don’t even really care about what you’re talking about lmao.

lvg8sz,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day    
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way    
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town    
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way    
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain    
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today    
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you    
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun    
So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking    
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older    
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time    
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines    
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way    
The time is gone, the song is over    
Thought I'd something more to say    
Home    
Home again    
I like to be here    
When I can    
When I come home    
Cold and tired    
It's good to warm my bones    
Beside the fire    
Far away    
Across the field    
Tolling on the iron bell    
Calls the faithful to their knees    
To hear the softly spoken magic spell

Meanwhile, I think Kanye has released at best a mediocre album with Yeezus, an album that sounds more like an aborted experiment and Kanye trying to play catch up, with very minimal success over the entire album. Blood on the Leaves and Black Skinhead are the only songs that stand out as truly great, with I Am A God and New Slaves being pretty good, and the rest ranging from boring to nearly unlistenable.

9nhmnm,"Copyright: This covers unique pieces of work from Poems to music to art to even potentially code. If you create something unique, it is automatically covered by copyright. No applications, you don't even need to put a ©. Copyright exists to protect individuals. Lasts for 70 years after your death, very long time!

Patents: These broadly cover ideas that could be exploited for monetary gain. They are used by individuals and companies to protect their ideas and inventions. It basically allows you to design a new phone and then patent that unique design so no-one can copy you. Patents are applied for and can cost thousands (and you have to renew then too, cannot remember how often). Additionally, patents are only applied when you can prove that your idea is not already in the public space and the whole application process takes i think around 4+ years (in the UK at least). Patents are largely for functional things, rather than for artistic things. After a period of time patents cannot be renewed any further and are placed into the public domain, which is why after a while certain products start to be manufactured by other companies (I think it's 20 years).

Trademarks: These are basically to protect the end user. If you wanted a coca cola, you would go to the shop and buy a can of coca cola which had the coca cola logo on it. If another company created a drink and used the same logo, some customers could be mistaken and buy the wrong one. This is especially important for high risk things such as vehicles. Trademarks are applied for and ensure that the general public are protected from copycats using the same branding, as well as protecting companies from having their brands copied. Important part about this is you cannot choose when to enforce this. A company that does not always pursue legal action against people abusing their trademarks is at risk of losing the trademark. If coke let pepsi use the coke name, before long the public with associate coke with pepsi too and so that trademark would not be valid. It's why companies go after often harmless breaches of trademark, it's too risky not to.

Design rights: These protect designs, I can't remember exactly but I think it's related to the way things are coloured and shaped. I think these are applied for as well.

It has been a while since I last looked at all of this stuff so I am a bit rusty, but you get the general idea. Furthermore, certain things may be different in US and other countries  Feel free to correct any mistakes.

471m8z," Speaking of Love and Verbs:

Todd Rundgren's song ""The Verb To Love""

Some people tell me that love is a feeling
Or a possession
Somehow it seems so cold
And when they say love is sweet,

Does it mean that you eat it?
Maybe you drink it,
Does it fill up an empty hole?
I'm lookin' for a love and I may not find it

You know it doesn't mean a thing
Without some action behind it
Please come home
I can hear them calling

Please come home
Please don't leave us all alone
Your mama and your papa are crying all alone
You better let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice

'Til we get the true version of
The meaning of the verb 'To Love'
What does it mean to love?
And when somebody needs love,

Do they spend some money?
Say something funny,
Ask for some tenderness?
And when you want to touch of love,

Do you lie on your back?
Stand on your head,
How do you feel it best?
I'm looking for a love with no strings attached

To take me like I am, that's the only catch
Please come home
I can hear them calling
Please come home

Please don't leave us all alone
Your wife and your lover are crying all alone
You better let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice
'Til we learn the true version of

The meaning of the verb 'To Love'
Does it mean any more,
The more you talk about it
Is it anymore real

If you jump around and shout it
I'm sick and tired of hearing
'bout everyone without it and
Too much talkin' sends me walkin'

Night is falling and everybody's calling for love
Everybody's lookin' for their one and only
It's only just a game 'cause they're scared to be lonely
Please come home

I can hear them calling
Please come home
Please don't leave us all alone
Your brothers and your sisters are crying all alone

You got let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice
'Til we get the true version of
The meaning of the verb 'To Love'
What does it mean to love?

The only reason you'd do something like that is to be shady and make it as difficult as possible to unsubscribe.. I wonder how many people sent in mail and the form, only to be told after they were charged irregardless of that fact, that they never seen the paperwork. Bet it happens more times than not. You'd probably be told it takes 45 days to process the paperwork. 😕 It would cost you $10 for the hassle of sending the form certified to make sure someone signed for it, so you know they got it, and you can bet the 'that person doesn't work here anymore' excuse rears its head a lot.

She could take the money and run. Support republicans who, after a 2 trillion dollar tax cut for the wealthy, are proposing another multi billion dollar tax cut that would exclusively benefit the uberwealthy. She actually made a rant a while ago where she was upset about the amount of her taxes, but she wasn’t saying “I shouldn’t have to pay taxes” she was saying “what the fuck is there to show for all this money you guys are taking?!”

Her supporting a man who wants to increase taxes on people in her bracket so that others can have better access to healthcare and education, things she already can more than pay for for herself and her loved ones, shows a lot about her character and her want to make a difference in her entire community.

Edit to add:  it’s interesting that she would give up a lot more money in taxes if bernie wins than she gained when stealing from those guys. Poverty is the mother of crime. She is making choices that shows she wants to eliminate the very pressures that got to her. Not excusing her behavior, lots of poor people don’t steal. Just saying that being willing to come out of your own pocket for the healthcare and education of all does speak to your character. A lot.

Also for anyone to be charged for assault and robbery, someone is going to have to press charges. hmm, I wonder why no one has came forward to do so... could it be that rappers don't always do every thing they say they've done!? Blasphemy, I tell you.

Let's see, no evidence, inadmissible ""confession,"" no victims so you can even really say there's a crime?

""Innocent until proven guilty"" must be the phrase you've been looking for.

I call them faces. And if you get ""good"" at hiding it, you essentially learn more faces to mask the depression.

Chester played a very large roll in my teens (I watched them on TRL, for those of us who know the acronym), that's how far back.

Its painful to know how influential he was in that dark time for me in middle/ high-school and yet, here he is, gone for the same reason that helped me.

Its vicious. Makes you think, if he can't save himself, as my role model, how the fuck am I going to do it, ya know?

y3pme4,"*Here’s the scam:*

The “OFFICIAL PLATINUM” seats are just regular tickets they hold back until the first allotment sells out.*

- You somehow by the grace of God, get into the on sale and try to get seats

- You are shown seats that are supposedly available, but they are not. That’s when you see the “sorry another fan beat you to these seats” message.

- Those seats were never available, or you never had a shot. They show you these to MAKE YOU FAIL OVER AND OVER and make you freak out that you won’t get into the show

- Then they start showing you the OFFICIAL PLATINUM SEATS. These seats are held back at first, and based on the amount of people in the waiting room, the demand, and you clicking around - they change the price on those seats in real time.

- The Official Platinum seats is Ticketmaster selling them at a scalper’s level pricing. AND YOUR FAVORITE BAND GETS A CUT.

- Ticketmaster takes the bad guy role for your favorite band. However, they force the bands to do this model so they suck.


*Last - They never staffed back up after Covid on purpose to let millions of dollars in ticket money just “disappear” because there was no one to answer for support calls. I lost $500 in tickets on a rescheduled show because the tickets weren’t in my account and I’m NOT the only one I’m sure. 🤷‍♂️",2022-10-14 20:33:06

y3pme4,"🙃

The prices suck, but, personally I'm glad for dynamic pricing. It raises the prices so that there are tickets to buy, at all. I'd rather go to one expensive concert a year than zero because they all sell out instantly.

If they price the tickets stupid cheap, then they just sell out instantly, and it becomes (1) essentially a lottery to get tickets, and (2) a scalper's paradise.",2022-10-14 23:39:22
y3pme4,It's not ticketmaster. . It's the show. I've got plenty of great priced tickets for all kinds of well known and lesser known artists during the past year. Maybe inflation? 😥 Sucks though but Blink 182 sucked anyway.,2022-10-15 03:35:41
y3pme4,"The prices are high because Americans, especially the generation right now, has no idea how finances work, and are not smart enough to figure out high price vs low price according to their own financial standard. $500 is cheap for someone making $500k/year plus. Its very high for someone making even around $200k/year. But Americans are entitled, and they'll pay. I don't blame Ticketmaster or the artists a single bit. I would do the same if my target market was a bunch of idiots.

Edit: This rubbed some people the wrong way. Good, someone needs to tell them the truth, and its not their idiot friend making $60k as a store manager thinking they should pay $500 to see bLiNk 182 🥵🤪🥴",2022-10-14 14:47:42

y3pme4,"I’ve been so fed up with the ridiculous cost and fees of concerts I’ve basically been shunning any national big acts in favor of going to small venues to support local and regional artists. If I look back on some of my favorite shows they’re almost always the small intimate venues when you can be close to the artists and feel the energy and rawness. Yeah it may lack the production value but you also can’t replicate the feel and authenticity of those shows in these giant stadium venue types. I realize that all artists need to recoup from the covid drought years and costs for touring and production have gone up a ton but the Ticketmaster fees for doing jack shit and now the inflated scalper pricing is just insane. If you love music and going to shows I think the best way to get back at Ticketmaster is by not shelling out hundreds of dollars only to be in a massive crowd to pay $15 for a bud light and be hundreds of feet away from the artist only to hear some sweaty bros screaming behind you. Instead support the artists and venues in your community. Yeah, they may not have the glitz and maybe not all the artists will be seasoned but there’s so many talented artists that are barely known it’s ridiculous. You may find the next blink-182 and can say you supported them from the start. 🍻",2022-10-14 19:18:22

I think all were mostly sold in presales there were three the only I could buy in presale was to purchase Ticketmaster premium plus .

It seemed like they were monitoring my clicks and then readjusting prices. Anyways the taxes and fees for two decent seats were $250… I will buy nosebleeds or just reminisce past concerts for that fuckery,2022-10-15 04:22:46

v9gq37,"Seeing as the anti- anti-vax defence force is up in the comments section calling people names again let's clear something up.  
  
There is **no proof** that the COVID vaccine caused Biebs to get this virus, but there is **reasonable** suspicion surrounding it, given what information we know.  
  
That **does not** mean that the vaccine **did not** get to the health condition here, that just means it hasn't been investigated enough to draw a formal conclusion. Which is also reasonable given the limits we have for an investigation like this. But that doesn't mean JB's vaccine and this virus are unrelated, there's just nothing to conclude.  
  
Once again: **the absence of evidence does not suggest the evidence of absence.** Just because we can't formally conclude that this was linked to the vaccine, doesn't mean it has 100% nothing to do with the vaccine. Anyone saying that the vaccine has nothing to do with this has 100% no proof to their claims and are simply spreading non scientific rhetoric and misinformation.  
  
What we do know is that the vaccine *can* be linked to this, however people claiming this has everything to do with the vaccine, and people claiming this has nothing to do with the vaccine, are both wrong. Suspicions are reasonable given the science provided on the COVID vaccine.   
  
Now that that's out of the way, feel free to downvote me, call me a conspiracy nut, and an anti vaxxer. Don't forget to see what subs I comment on too 😉 PS. 2x vaxxed.

v9gq37,"I've got something completely different (grade 2 meningioma) but after my partial tumour resection about a month ago now, I seem to have similar issues affecting my facial nerve and auditory nerve (as that's partly where the tumour was/is)

Anyways long story made almost short, I use 'Glad Press 'n Seal' for my eye that refuses to close fully, before I go to sleep after I apply some eye drops and/or ointment. I know this sounds like a really messed up plug/advertisement for the product, but people do this (as my facial therapist and hospital staff suggested) as it provides a nice seal around your eye to keep it in a moist area and not dry out as easily. 

I hope this info helps in some way  :)

Stevie Wonder, gotta be an industry plant 🌱. How can a 13 year old reach number one out of nowhere like that, you’re just not making sense if you disagree.

Michael Jackson’s a plaantttt, I’m telling you guys. 12 years old with a Grammy nomination? Pleeeaaase. In 20 years, when he’s 32, everyone will have forgotten him, come on, it only makes sense.",2020-01-27 16:32:26

I never knew I had synesthesia until I described music to my doctor and they ordered up some tests.

munsxd,"One profesor from music university told me  that you shouldn't listen more than three songs from same genre in a row, becaouse you get thoose emotions. And after that i realized that for me that was a truth if i listen to the same type of song for more than three songs i get thoose emotions 🤷‍♂️",2021-04-20 22:50:02
munsxd,"Nope, you are the only human who experiences emotional responses to sound and music. It's actually a wonder that music has been created and developed by the rest of humankind, given that it bears no deep meaning to any of us... But luckily for you we've all been acting like we also have a passion for music and composing it almost as though we had that same emotional connection that you are experiencing.

munsxd,"Yes, absolutely. 100%. There is no shame in it, I feel. Being able to feel emotional connection and express that emotion is a treasure. Many people (especially men like me) try so hard to suppress tears, I still feel weird about crying in my car on the way to work because of a great song, but I suppress THAT urge and celebrate the fact that I'm feeling something. 😁 Good on you.",2021-04-21 02:16:48

munsxd,"Not sure how active this post is now but god yes. All the damn time. Not all kinds of music, but yes. Especially things that are heavy on piano or cello or both at the same time. Something about string music gets me soooo caught up. Somnus and Omnia Lacrima from the Final Fantasy XV soundtrack, Rozen's reimaginings of the Ballad of The Windfish and Dearly Beloved, the Synthesis album versions of Your Star and Lacrymosa by Evanescence... The list goes on.

Legit one of my favorite things to do is lay on my bed in the dark with headphones in and just listen to music, letting the emotional power of it wash over me. I usually listen to movie and video game soundtracks at work and have to be careful what I have playing in my headphones cause I've come close to crying at my desk and my manager has asked if I'm okay before 😆",2021-04-21 03:11:12

munsxd,"Absolutely. Theres many songs that fill my heart with so much joy, that I can't help but smile and just cry. When I do cry like that, it feels like a ton of bricks just broke apart and fell off of me.

I go to those songs when I'm feeling lost and unstable. I've developed a pretty bad anxiety problem this past year and it's nice to know that I have a natural medicine I can always turn to. Music is therapy for the soul ❤",2021-04-21 04:35:01

munsxd,"Hey, I'm just here to let you know that 10 years ago I was exactly where you are.  I remember sitting with the psychiatrist learning about electorshocks because that was the next step.  I was very very low.  5 hospitalizations, multiple suicide attempts, I had absolutely no hope.  I know what it feels like because I lived there a long time.

I've always loved music.  I grew up with musicians, my mom is a classically trained singer, I play piano, we had hundreds of records.  Music was important to me.

That went away with depression.  And it stayed that way for a long time. 

My depression has been well controlled for the last 5 years.  2020 was rough, but I didn't fall into a severe depression, which I was truly worried would happen.  Which is another way if telling you that it can get better and it can stay better.

Last year I bought myself a cheap record player so that I could listen to some of my old albums.  I startedd making Spotify playlists.  I caught up on am entire decade of music that I missed.  My love of music is back.

There is hope.  Just keep holding on, take your meds, talk to your therapists, and do the work and it can get much better. ♥️",2021-04-21 01:28:21

That being said, with vaccination and mask requirements none of these people would be responsible for any serious negative effects. I was extremely cautious in the beginning of covid, literally wore a gas mask to go anywhere with lots of people (including when I unfortunately had to take a flight). With vaccines and masks indoors, it really is like the flu, even with delta.

If you were going to do it that way, you'd be best setting it to 10 by default and just rewriting the one.  That way it doesn't have to wait for the else to kick in every time.

Outside of ""Wooden Ships"", I am sadly not familiar with CSNY's music but I did find David Crosby to be a fascinating human being.

I loved David Crosby's rolling stone column as it was no holds barred and this man didn't hold his tongue at all in it.

I really respected David Crosby for what he did for Drew Barrymore, that was just incredible.

I thought that the ""remember my name"" documentary was just incredible and really gave me insight into what was a kind but very complicated man.

As someone who adores anything counter culture related and anything 1960's, my heart is broken tonight.

I knew that David Crosby was sick and had a battery of health problems but wow.

My condolences and my heart go out to David's family.  😢 😭

g7kimq,"Rap/nu-metal in the early 2000s probably had a lot to do with that, given Post’s age. It doesn’t get remembered as fondly as a lot of other genres in rock other than in terms of it being a soundtrack of youth and being a big movement at the time, but bands like Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, RATM, hed (PE), Papa Roach etc seemed to really culminate in those years and be at its most popular. There were definitely bands before them (311, Anthrax’s crossover with Public Enemy, Body Count, Senser, even Beastie Boys who evolved really from rock and have Kerry King from Slayer on No Sleep Til Brooklyn 🤟🏻) and also plenty of hip hop acts who introduced metal sounds like Cypress Hill etc, but that was the golden era for that genre and probably helped recruit a lot of music fans who loved both genres. Both genres could be politically and socially explosive, too, which helped them compliment each other so well and made them great bedfellows.

Even if most of the above aren’t so much my cup of tea right now I feel they’re all hugely responsible for my twin love of metal and hip hop even now.",2020-04-25 09:19:15

What made me mad was when everything crashed/people were getting booted IN the checkout and Taylor nation was making those ✨cute✨ puns and not even acknowledging what was happening. Did they not think to read the room, read the comments of swifties begging them for help/acknowledgement of the issues?

My verified fan link didn’t even work. My husband was booted 3 times and kicked to the back of the line, my sister, husband and I all had “exceeded seat limit” issues as we were watching seats disappear before our eyes, and I managed to used my cousin’s code to get nosebleeds in Tampa for $150 each after waiting for 6+ hours. I wish I had felt more excited than disappointed and I am VERY grateful and lucky. I will be excited, I know I’m not the only one, but I have to get over the stress/anger I went through to get to here.

It blinds me with rage knowing scalpers got in and are selling tickets for thousands of dollars while true fans who waited longer than me, got in and saw that every seat was sold out. Ticketmaster should have shut it down once all seats were sold.

He met his first wife when she was an underage teenage belly dancer, her mom insisted she give Prince a tape of her dancing at one of his concerts, he liked what he saw I guess and hired/toured with/got legal guardianship over her for a few years. ☹️ And this was in the '90s.  

I read her autobiography of her time married to him and even though she genuinely seems to recall him lovingly and fondly (I guess it's hard not to when your first love was an eccentric rock star who groomed you) there were no shortage of stories of him being weird and controlling. Off the top of my head (though keep in mind it's been a couple years since I read it):  
 
- Insisted to her, a young girl who he was the legal guardian/employer of for her final teenage years, that she start taking birth control almost immediately after she became of age. She insists nothing happened before she became of age, though that might be more insidious to me   
- Tried to get her to change her name to Arabia even though she's Puerto Rican? lol. he was going through an Egypt aesthetic thing and kept trying to mold her into a some kind of Middle Eastern princess  
- insisted on no/bare minimum prenatal care during her pregnancy despite her displaying huge red flags for birth defects (he was a huge Jehovah's Witness in the last few decades of his life), and then  
- tried to insist on 0 medical intervention during her labour where she almost certainly would have died without it, because 'whatever happens is God's will' but he was basically told to fuck off and she got a C-section lol, and then  
- when their baby died shortly after birth from aforementioned defect, Prince wouldn't let her be present when they took him off life support/physically restrained her from leaving their house to go to the hospital. In interviews she's excused this as ""I wouldnt have been able to handle that so I think I'm glad he did that"". But still dude! Fuck! and then:   

- insisted she go on an Oprah interview with him shortly after their son's death to lie and say everything's fine and the baby was actually alive. [You can clearly see her trying to hold back tears around the 17:55 mark.](https://youtu.be/Sx5N4pMIbVI)  and then:

- withheld their sons ashes from her after their divorce/most likely destroyed them. She doesn't know where they are to this day IIRC and said it's the one thing she's wanted back from their marriage  

This is all literally in her book that she wrote. I remember getting the vibe that she still loved him deeply and always would, which broke my heart because he treated that poor girl terribly. I LOVE the guy's music, and love hearing the wacky ""want some pancakes........... bitches"" stories about him as much as anyone else and have since I was a teenager, but when a Prince song pops up on Spotify I tell myself it's fine to listen because he's dead now and no longer the beneficiant of the 1/150th of a shilling he would get for my song stream, lol.

Y’all are screaming about consent to sex but are totally ok with a 12 year old making the decision I’ve talked about 🤦🏼‍♀️ and yes, in some cases, I do know more than these doctors out here if doctors are completely ok with a child, A CHILD, making this type of decision and then just going along with it. She hasn’t even continued growing/developing and they want to do all this? Y’all are sick. As I’ve said before, once she’s an adult and has the mental capacity to understand, fully, the repercussions and changes these decisions will cause…I will drive her to the appointment/surgery and she can become a kitchen cabinet for all I care - she’s my niece and I’ll love her regardless but I cannot sit here and pretend that she is old enough to fully understand what she is agreeing to and wanting to do! And y’all can’t bitch about a 16 year old not being old enough to consent if you’re on board with allowing children to make these types of decisions. Taking advantage and abuse is taking advantage and abuse. Period.

She doesn’t want any male or female genitalia. I have ZERO problem with her being anything she wants…but having surgery and blockers before she is fully capable of understanding the full repercussions of her actions.  Once she’s 18 or older, she can identify as a kitchen cabinet and change anything she wants because she’s an ADULT and has the mental capacity to look into every option and truly find the root of who she is and wants to. Lemme guess, I’m dangerous to my sons mental health as well because he wanted to be a t-Rex when he was 3-6 and I didn’t immediately rush him to a doctor, pump him full of meds, chop off his arms and file his teeth into sharp points to let him live as a t-Rex right?",2023-02-16 11:09:51

A freeze happened during purchse. No confirmation came up that I got the tix. But the $400+ was removed from my bank. Days and days of calls and emails and even a 3hr drive to their office to discover...no I didn't get the tickets but Money would eventually return. 3 weeks it took. My saved up $$... came back when he had sold out my local show. But 2xs the price and could buy the scalpers. Sadly... i love ed. But I was broke. And why would i support such things.

8l9h1y,"Ed Sheerans team, once the tickets were sold, “very labouriously” went through all the ticket sales to identify known tours...

🙄 Please, don’t they know a programmer than can automate 99% of the legwork? I very much doubt a team of human even organisers manually screened all the sales.

Here: Ctrl + F [details of known ticket touts]


JavaScript:

{
var ticketsSold = [];
var = purchaserDetails;
var toutDetails = [];
}

{
function ticketSearch (ticketsSold, purchaserDetails) {
     for (ticketsSold = 0; ticketsSold < ticketsSold.length; ticketsSold ++) {
      if (purchaserDetails == array.toutDetails) {
           console.log(purchaserDetails);
} else if {
          (purchaserDetails > 4 == array.ticketsSold) {
            console.log(purchaserDetails);
}}}}}

Terrible code, atrocious, will probably even systems 32 a Mac, but 10 times better than ‘labouriously searching’ tickets sales.

What makes 70s drug music more “important” than 2010/2020’s party music?  Well, there is nothing that makes it more important other than the proclamations of a pathetic old man.  Dark Side of the Moon came out, what, 50 years ago?  Most of the people who remember when it came out are dead, it’s that fucking ancient.  Pink Floyd is completely irrelevant these days, maybe Roger Waters could spend some of that Dark Side of the Moon money to work on a time developing a time machine, so he could go back to the time when Pink Floyd and their drug music was edgy and relevant, back when Nixon was still in office.",2022-07-16 14:36:49

Then that guy who mumbles about a house fire and says ""thats alright, hush.""

I think it suffered (commercially, at least) when it came out not having anything in the “single” range.  Pigs on the Wing was too short, and the rest too long for radio.  Plus, punk & disco were both sprouting up and there was some backlash to prog rock maybe.

The show's presented as a community radio show for the fictional town of Neo Amsterdamn, a dystopian cyberpunk version of NYC. The segment is about how some residents are lucky to get a vaccine that's microchipped with a metal guitar pedal's circuitry, and how one of the side-effects is improved discernment for the subtle differences in metal sub-genres. 🤘",2021-02-17 16:36:18

* Banks – Begging For Thread  (actually counterexample, but awesome song and i don't like their other songs)
* Horja – Flowercrown  (it's like this one have 1 album only)  
* New Education – Arcane (B-Complex Radio Edit) (or original. their other songs are not so... arcane :0)
* Metric – Gold Guns Girls (Riot 87 remix) (Riot 87, why did you went ful dubstep after this track? Anyway, it's one of a kind track, dnb + her voice = ♥)
* Armin van Buuren feat. Martijn Hagens – Golddigger - Armin van buuren is a trance DJ, however this track is not trance nor remix just listen.

Imagine how it would be now if he was alive, and they were working on new music. I have nothing to look forward to in music after he left, I mean, yeah there are other artists that I like, but Linkin Park was the only one that I'd call myself as a ""fan"" of. It feels empty without him. 😔😔😔

142tple,"I worked concessions for Aramark in high school in a small rural town called Philadelphia.

Depending on the event, I would be at Veterans Stadium (RIP), Wells Fargo, or the E-Center. It wasn’t like I was hired to work the Dippin Dots stand. I could be pour nachos in section 138 and then cooking Dominoes pizzas in a completely different section, then going to pour beers (underage 🤷) in the lawn section. Most of the food was cooked in a central location and brought out to the different stands.

Food service on that large of a scale is an entirely different beast. You can’t just logistically have thirty restaurants and vendors all with their own deliveries. You’ve got to manage employee access, sanitation, and disposal. You’re also playing against competitions.

There are instances where other restaurant groups will buy a contract to open a location. But that contract is made with the larger food service group in exchange for a concession fee.

There’s other instances (like Starbucks, Benihanas, Sbaros, or Chick-Fil-A) where those brands are licensed or franchised and run by the food service group. So employees aren’t “Starbucks baristas” they work for a company like CMS.",2023-06-07 02:40:55

6dndeu,"Have an up vote from me my friend.  This made my Saturday morning.

I run a support group for people coming off benzodiazepines and z-drugs like Ambien, benzos in all but name, and trust me, these drugs are hellish to withdraw from if used for more than the recommended 2 to 4 weeks max for a significant group of us.

You become tolerant to them very quickly, and need more and more to get the same effect.  Because of tolerance, you can go through withdrawal even while on the drugs.  People have so many strange symptoms, even physical symptoms, from the medication and don't always connect the symptoms to the drug.

Chris' wife is now speaking out forcefully about what happened here.

There are so many of us damaged souls, including the likes of Stevie Nicks and Eminem, who have lost years of our lives in withdrawal and while on these drugs.

They should never be prescribed for depression as sedative hypnotics and CNS depressants can actually *cause* depression. 

I could go on and on.

I'm so sorry this happened to you Chris, RIP.  You are ❤️ed

If you are on these drugs, please get informed.  www.benzobuddies.org is a good place to start and Dr. Heather Ashton's, The Ashton Manual for safe, slow tapered withdrawal strategies.

People on street drugs and alcohol get better fairly rapidly after withdrawal.  Many of us withdrawing from benzos or z-drugs are ill after we discontinue for years",2017-05-27 16:11:56

6dndeu,"Two things about this: 

The combo of this mic, mic pre amp and her voice is an elixir of the gods.  Thumbs up to the sound guy behind the scene whose choices made this sound 3D on an iPhone 7 👍🏼!

If Edgar Allen Poe wrote music, this would be one of his own. The melody to me is one of the most mesmerizing and haunting facets to the songs' original production. This rendition shows how a great melody can stand on its own with little arrangement behind it. I feel as though the original recording relied on tone to fully deliver the intended impact and meaning when the need to be airplay friendly dictated a faster tempo hurting the delivery a bit. Even though economics  detracted from what could have been a more more appropriate match to the lyrics, it's one of the top 10 hard rock songs to date in my stupid opinion.

I’m not saying I disagree. It’s not a show I’d go to anyway. 

I’m just super curious about what the next virus mutation will look like since a large swath of humanity has decided covid is over. It has evolved to be more lethal (Delta) and then more contagious (Omicron).  Will we get a DeltaCron or maybe just an Omicron junior...?

He made fantastic music that I still listen to all the time. We were supposed to see him play this summer. It was going to be an item off my bucket list to see my country music hero play. He will be missed dearly 😢,2020-03-30 13:17:09

dzqjla,"Hi Amy! I'm asking questions here for my girlfriend named Lilly who's not as Reddit savvy as I am. She is one of your biggest fans and she has a few questions for you. 

1) I've noticed that your song Imaginary is on Origin, Fallen, AND Synthesis. Its honestly a fun way to see how the bands sound and your voice has evolved over time when listening back to back. But is there a special reason that this particular song has been updated so many times?

2) What's your process when creating a new song? Do melodies or words come to you first? Do you like to spark a particular emotion in your music?

3) Was the experience of recording for a video game soundtrack any different from recording for a studio album? Were you a part of the writing process for The Chain?

4) Would you ever make a studio recording of you and Lindsey Stirling performing Shatter Me?

5) New Evanescence album.....? 👀",2019-11-21 22:14:33
dzqjla,"Hey Amy! 
 I just wanted to let you know I have grown up listening to evanescence, your music has inspired me and helped me through some of the most difficult times in my life, thank you so much for all your amazing work❤️  I finally came to a show Dec 8 2017 in Toronto for your synthesis tour and it was the most beautiful thing I have ever experienced in my life. Thank you so much for everything you do. ❤️",2019-11-21 22:02:57
dzqjla,Hi! I can’t get enough of your music! The band is so strong right now so I KNOW the next album is going to be phenomenal 😍! Could we ever get Lost in Paradise with just the piano and maybe some strings? I was a little disappointed that the piano for Lost in Paradise was removed completely in Synthesis. :(,2019-11-21 21:57:21
dzqjla,"I wasn’t a Lindsey Sterling fan until I saw you both perform for the last synthesis tour, you’re both amazing and Shatter Me was FANTASTIC! Any chance we could get a studio version of Shatter Me? (love goes on and on was good too 😜)",2019-11-21 21:59:10
dzqjla,"Hi Amy. 
I’m a huge fan of your music- It means the world to me. Imaginary has saved my life on many occasions. 
I never know what to ask in situations like this.
Are there any academic fields that interest you such as sociology, biology, psychology, math, language, etc.? And what -if anything would you see yourself doing professionally if you weren’t a full time musician or a stay at home mother?
Much love. ❤️

dzqjla,"Hi Amy!! I've been a fan of your music for over a decade now and I can't get through the day without listening to one of your songs! I just wanted to first of all say thank you for everything!!

My question is: will the sound of The Chain be similar to the sound of the new album? 

Oh and one more question I've always wanted to know... at the beginning of The Only One, are you singing 'all the tuna fish sing in the tuna afternoon', or is it someone else? 

Cannot wait to have the song on repeat! All my love forever ❤",2019-11-21 22:08:21

It was such a great show. If you noticed a headbanded boy during Imaginary, it's probably me :D I have a few questions that I wanted to ask:

1. Was there a song that you wanted to re-record for Synthesis, and decided not to? And is there any chance we get Imperfection rock version as a studio recording, preferably as a bonus song on the next album?

2. You did a full acoustic set last tour, and we loved it! Would you think of making an acoustic tour/album someday?

3. What do you do to preserve your voice while touring? Your voice was awesome last tour and it barely got exhausted I guess.

4. What is the sound of the album gonna be like, and which album do you think it will sound close to?

5. Bonus question: Which one is harder for you to sing, ""Never Go Back"" or ""End of the Dream?"" :D

Thank you so much, we love you! ♡ ❤",2019-11-21 22:48:30

dzqjla,"Hey, Amy!   
First of all, I wanna tell you that I love you SO MUCH!!! You're like family to me... I'm a singer too and your music inspires me so much. You kept me going when everything was falling appart. I'm emetophobic and your music helped me through my worst phases. And I just heard The Chain and loved it. It's really great! Thank you for being so awesome! And for making this awesome music. And, thank you for writing Lost in Paradise, in special. That song is so meaningful to me, you can't even imagine... ❤️   
My question is... What advice would you give to a rock singer that's starting her carreer, and lives in a country where rock is so devalued? And... I know you might be tired of hearing this, but... When Evanescence will come back to Brazil? lol  
Please, answer me... At least, the first question. It would make my day. I love you, from all of my heart. And thank you so much for everything. I mean... Thank you for existing...  ❤️",2019-11-21 22:38:14

So sorry for sitting on the floor last September during my M&G with you guys in Istanbul 🙄
My legs weren't really helping me!
How can you balance your work life, music, tours, playing abroad, being a wife, and motherhood all at the same time?! God bless you! Seriously! I hope you're having a good day 😘",2019-11-21 22:41:10
dzqjla,"Amy,  
what Italian coffee do you like??   
Do you still have the green Moka that Fede-and-us gave you in 2011,(Emi Music) in Milan??  
That day was the first time I met you ♥ And then years later I gave you 5 space stuff painted canvases,   
and I hope you all guys had one each!  
 Im curious, which canvas did you choose?

big hug Amy!!",2019-11-21 22:41:19
dzqjla,"Hi Amy, my name's Carly. I saw you live back on 07/28/18 with Lindsey Stirling, I had the VIP Soundcheck Experience but was meant to get Meet & Greet. I was wondering if you'll come back to the Capital Region while on tour again someday? I would really love to meet you....It's a very huge dream of mine. 😊 You're so inspirational and you're one of my biggest Idols, I love your music and your mesmerizing voice. Your music and Evanescence has help me throughout so much and I'm very grateful to be a fan. I sung ""My Immortal"" at my Grandparents 50th Anniversary long before my Grandmother and my eldest cat both passed away in 2017. I love your cover of ""Sally's Song"" from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas and ""All Across The Universe"" by The Beatles! You played ""All Across The Universe"" back on 07/28/18 with Lindsey Stirling and I also loved that you joined Lindsey for ""Shatter Me""! I'm so excited to be tuning in for the AMA to hear your cover of ""The Chain"" by Fleetwood Mac, your voice is amazing and Troy is such a great singer too!! ❤",2019-11-21 22:41:55

It was so beautiful and I literally teared up.  As well as find a way. Both are just done so incredibly well I listen to them daily. Thank you for the amazing music!
Lots of love 💕",2019-11-21 22:44:25
dzqjla,"What sort of vibe are you and the band aiming for on the new record? Synthesis, or more original album sound?

Has Stevie Nicks or any of the members of Fleetwood Mac said anything about your cover of The Chain? If yes, what did they say?!

How has becoming a mother influenced or changed your songwriting? I know you did your childrens album, was that enough outlet for that, or will there be ""motherly"" songs on the next Evanescence record? Would love to hear a hard ass song about how gross it is to change a diaper, all in metaphors 🤣

I've been a fan since 2003 when I was 12. Thank you for being a soundtrack to my growth into adulthood all these years. I love where the band is now and I can't wait for the years to come. Tell Jen, Troy, Will and Tim hello for me! 👍😘",2019-11-21 22:45:20

Hello Amy! Firstly my BIRTHDAY will be 11-25 and I will be VERY HAPPY if you answer me. It will be a gift for me!   


 I want to say I love you and everyone from Evanescence, and I love how the band is constantly evolving.  

My only question is: How does the band tackle these new challenges, as it were, because on each album, each discography has a totally different follow-up to the previous one and it's amazing! It's perfect, sublime !!! It's like a constant metamorphosis and I don't see any other alternative metal bands being as wonderful as you!  

 I wish the band success in this new project.  

Thank you for existing and saving so many lives with your songs 💜",2019-11-21 22:49:04

Greetings from Minnesota! I know I’ve told you before but I am so grateful for the tremendous impact you’ve had on my life, a gift I’ve been able to share with my son.

Obscure question, I know you’re a bit of a gamer have you gotten any new switch games your into? Oh and of course have you gotten Gears 5 to play? I’d hope they would have given you a free copy🤣

God bless and see you in Minneapolis in May😊",2019-11-21 22:50:40

The album will be an album or more singles? There will be a physical cd or just mp3? The Chain will be on the setlist for #worldscollidetour? When the feat with Lzzy out? Love you kiss from France (evanescence source France) ❤️❤️",2019-11-21 22:53:59
dzqjla,"Amy,  
during the last tour you told the crowd, many times, that Lost in Paradise is about the relinquishing of control, we need to have the feelings, give ourselves the permission to fall apart, because that's the only way we can stand up stronger and live our life.   
On 2 sept you guys were in Verona, and I was recovering from a terrible summer.. and on the ""run away, run away"" moment of Lip I fell apart. ♥ and that was a moment I will never forget, because I was able to feel myself again and I had been numb for months.   
But at the Ev concert we all get in touch with our most intimate and vulnerable part, and the Synthesis Tour was pretty intense! and I love that. Maybe this is the thing that made me all in love with you so much in the past years. I was a little girl when I heard BMTL for the first time in 2003.... im 28 now.  
Im grateful for living the same world you, Amy, and all the band are living. This is a special gift to me.  
We are one ♥

thank you for everything.   
and THE CHAIN is incredible!!!!!! ♥ ♥ ♥ keep on rocking  
love you,

dzqjla,"First, thank you for doing this Q&a and sharing the song!!!!!!!
Now, my Q's are:
1. Would you consider having the guys vocals in the next album? (After this, I'd really LOVE to hear more of them ❤😍).
2. Can we expect the new album out before the World Collides' tour or at least a couple of new songs?
3. Would you consider adding old songs such as Farther Away or Tourniquet back in the setlist or never-played-before songs such as Hello or Like You?
4. Love you and Evanescence to the moon and back :)",2019-11-21 22:55:04

1. What is your favourite song by Within Temptation?
2. I'm curious about this one. I've seen that you have worn a Dark Side of the moon shirt (correct me if I'm wrong) if so, what is your favourite song by Pink Floyd?
3. Video games: Would you like to take part of Final Fantasy game? 

Thank you so much for being the greatest inspiration in my life ❤

Just want to ask about the new material you'll worked on the past months, for the Ev5. Are this materials all new compositions or there are some stuff never released from the past years being reworked?

First, thank you so much for everything! 

Secondly, The End of the Dream is my all time favorite song! It speaks to me on so many levels. When I heard it live for the first time at Heinz Hall, I cried my eyes out! I would like to ask if you could possibly design a tattoo for me based off of this The End of the Dream? 

Lastly, THE CHAIN rocks!!!! Did everyone from the band contribute vocally?  I heard Troy in there but that was it. 😁",2019-11-21 23:01:03
dzqjla,"""The Chain"" is one of my favorite Fleetwood Mac songs. Thank you for making such a beautiful cover.

When I found out you were touring with Within Temptation my 16 year old self was SCREAMING. I'm 30. 😂

First question, please tell me you guys will be touring together in the US!!

Second question, Are you working on any music collaborations together? If so, what can you tell us?

I hope you see this comment, and if you’d be answering it, that would make my world!

3. Which song is hardest to play on the piano live?

I am so excited you are going this and hope I get a reply but I know there are many others on this Q&A lol. You are and have been my hero ever since I was a kid. Listening to your beautiful music and voice would always calm me down or lift me up when I was feeling sad. I even got to see you in Tampa for the Synthesis tour and at Rockville in Jacksonville when you performed  your older work. It was so amazing to see both sides of the band and i really admire everything you do!! I am not sure what to ask haha. Maybe how is it being a mother and will you ever do another children's album? I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. STAY AMAZING❤❤❤❤

Oh!! Also I am a HUGE Zelda fan and was wondering what your favorite Zelda game was and why. Mine is Twilight Princess because of it's darker theme and character development. I absolutely ADORE Midna and really loved the Wolf Link concept!!! Love you!!",2019-11-21 23:01:44
dzqjla,"Hi Amy. I remember in 2017, I went to my first concert ever, Evanescence in Tilburg. I was a 14 year old girl. I found out that I was just old enough to go alone and so I really wanted to go alone, also I had no friends that liked Evanescence back then. I remember the long drive and waiting in the venue. I was very tiny so I could only see your armpit, but I didn't really care. That was the night I truly fell in love with music. I will never forget it. So thank you, I wish I could explain to you in Dutch how much that concert means to me and how much you mean to me, I'd know a lot more words!

You are the reason I listen to all the music I'm listening too now. Björk, Aurora, Within Temptation, Halestorm, I could go on forever. But my questions are, how does it make you feel when you hear a story from a fan, talking about how much you mean to them and how you changed and might have even saved their lives? Oh and also, are you still working on the Joga cover from Björk?

Also my brain can't handle you and Within Temptation touring together. It is so magical, I'm so excited to go see you in Amsterdam!💜💜💜

Thank you for being such a big part of my life.❤️",2019-11-21 23:02:06

I'm such a huge fan of you & your music. The whole band has inspired me so much throughout my 20 years of life. I love you all so much & I'm so blessed to call myself a fan of Evanescence!

I do have a few questions. :) 

1. What would you tell your younger self? What would you want yourself to know then that you know now?

2. Have you always enjoyed Fleetwood Mac? I love The Chain cover! My dad (who passed away three years ago) introduced me to them when I was pretty young. 

3. What is your favorite thing about the Evanescence fanbase? I've always felt like the fans are so intensely passionate about your music. You all have so much talent & I can tell you guys love what you do. How does it feel to have so many people relate to you & your story through Evanescence?

4. What is your favorite version of Imaginary? That is one of my favorite songs & I couldn't be who I am today without it! I love the Origin version, personally. What was your vision while writing it? I love the imagery & the beautiful scene it creates in my mind. 💜

Once again, Amy, thank you for all you do. I hope you reply & if not, it's okay! May God bless you in all you do, & long live Evanescence.",2019-11-21 23:05:49

2. Day or Night? 

3. Sweet or Savoury? 

4. Pineapple on pizza - crime against food or pizza perfection? 

5. The ability to freeze (a short period of) time alone or with somebody else, or the power to travel through time once and witness something significant in history (personal or global) as an invisible passerby?

I have two questions and they're both about playing piano.
1. How long have you been playing the piano? 
(The piano parts in Evanescence songs and also your solo work always amaze as they are soooo beautiful😍)
2. I'm currently trying to teach myself to play the keyboard. Do you have any tips for me as a beginner?

Love from Germany and thank you for your beautiful music I enjoy every day❤❤",2019-11-21 23:19:23

dzqjla,"Hey hi Amy 👋🏼 

First I wanted to start by saying that I have been a fan of Evanescence since I was 14 years old. Your music has accompanied me all these years, and has given me the strength to overcome less good times.

Then I wanted to ask:

- How do you feel knowing that you can reach the hearts of so many people with your music?

- Did you like to record this version of ""The Chain""? (I like the original very much, but this one looks perfect 😋)

I hope that one day I will be able to realize my dream of seeing you live. Since I was 14 I've been dreaming about this. Now I'm almost 30.
Return to Portugal 😊",2019-11-21 23:21:46

Love you guys! 😍❤😱",2019-11-21 23:24:41
dzqjla,"Hey! I'm from Canada :)          
       
I've been listening to your music for almost 2 decades🤎 I would love to know, what is something that might be considered *unexpected* that you do to keep your vocals strong? I'm an amateur singer, and I'm always looking for ways to improve!",2019-11-21 23:28:05
dzqjla,"A few Q’s, so please take your pick if need be!

1. I love the way you expand on songs live, like disappear, the ending of Call Me, or the bridge in End Of The Dream for Synthesis. What do you aim for when expanding, and is there anything in particular you’d like to try?

2. The artwork for the Origin LP looks scanned. Have the original artwork files been lost? And was the record mastered from a CD or did you have the original pro tools files lying around still?

3. You joked as a 21 year old that you would strangle Britney Spears with the laces from your many corsets 😂. You also questioned whether you didn’t get it because you were so young. Do you think the industry has changed and is there anything you now “get” as an older person?

4. You’ve often thanked Diana Meltzer for discovering you, but have also been critical of Wind Up, like many of their bands have been. What’s a battle you fought with them that you won? And how is the relationship with Bicycle now that you’re indie?",2019-11-21 23:28:33
dzqjla,"Hi Amy! This cover is awesome! I can’t wait for you guys next album! I’ve been a fan forever. Since the fallen days, all the way through to the new album Synthesis. Gotta say that Synthesis is such an amazing album. The reimagining of these songs I’ve known forever is incredible. Especially End of the Dream. Incredible!

Anyways I do have a couple questions 😁

1. What are your biggest influences when you right music? Do you have a process to get you in the right mind?

2 . Where do you think the style of evanescence is going next? Each album seems to be another evolution and I can’t wait to hear what happens next!

Final question:

3.  Hello is one of my all time favourite songs. The piano in contrast with the cello and your incredible voice and lyrics; I just want to ask, these melodies you’ve created, how do they come to you? Is it like a free flow of consciousness and it appears? Or have you already got it in your brain? Or something else?


Anyways, I wish you the absolute best! Evanescence has and always will be one of my all time favourites. Also gotta say the other covers you did in Recover, are so amazing!

Thank you for being you and creating all of this beautiful music. It inspires me every time I listen to it. 

I can’t wait to see what’s next for both Evanescence and Amy Lee🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺


Also please tour back in Australia again 😁 I didn’t get to see you last time 🌺",2019-11-21 23:30:47

She's in a band ( shameless plug: 'Beth Blade and the Beautiful Disasters' 🤭 ) and sadly, they were heavily affected by the collapse of Pledge Music at the height of their momentum.

My question is, with this dynamic shift that's happened in the industry to accommodate the internet, and given you and the other guys in Evanescence have had to transition from early days of the internet to now, what advice would you give to bands, artists, etc. in these times? What do you think is the key to being able to make a living from your artistic talent?",2019-11-21 23:32:22

You have helped me get through the craziness of my addiction and I’m blessed to be able to say that I sit here with 3 years sober. I’ve been given the opportunity to share my story around the world and the simple fact that you are who you are and you celebrate that has helped push me to be proud of who I am. You have helped thousands of people and my whole goal in life is to help just one person find some strength in their sobriety. My question for you is what has been your favorite place to visit and play. Also, I can’t wait for you to come tour here in the U.S again!

dzqjla,"Hi Amy I just wanted to say that you are my biggest inspiration ever, I've been through a lot of bad times in my life and your music saved my life, you are my role model and I'm a singer because of you but I'm very shy and I have lost lot of opportunities for that, I would love you to hear me sing someday and listen to your advices, and I was wondering if there's any possibility that you guys came someday to bogotá - Colombia again?
P.S: thank you for your music!!! ❤️❤️❤️ Sending love from colombia 🇨🇴",2019-11-21 23:38:30
dzqjla,"Hellooooo. First AMA I've been a part of ever. Evanescence was the 2nd rock band I ever got into. I started guitar because of you; the 1st complete song I ever learned was bring me to life. And my immortal was 2nd. I tried to learn haunted as my 1st guitar solo, and it.... well... wasn't exactly successful, but🤷‍♂️

Oh, and the 1st concert I ever attended was an Evanescence one, specifically during the Synthesis tour in 2017. I'm really hoping I can attend a ""normal"" show soon too.

My question is will you ever do something like Synthesis ever again? Or at least something acoustic/orchestral? 

An acoustic or purely orchestral album would be cool.

Random question, have you heard of the band babymetal?",2019-11-21 23:40:02
dzqjla,"Casual good day, totally nonchalant... Ehem...
Day Good! Amy Ma'am! Your honor...

So, how would you describe your type of ""dancing"" while one stage?🤘😅🤟

Have you ever gone into a mosh pit?

is ""farther away"" making a comeback?🤟🤪🤘

And can you dab on one of the shows?😅😅

Respectfully,

Love Always. Lisa from Texas💜",2019-11-21 23:43:00
dzqjla,"Hey Amy! How are you? 😁

1) I loved when you duetted with Lzzy Hale on your joint tour years ago, did you ever consider recording anything together?

2) is there any other female in rock you’d like to duet with one day?

3) is there any part of you that’s ever tempted to... I don’t know... record a musical soundtrack???? Even just for funsies 😂🤷🏻‍♂️

Love you and thank you for being the soundtrack to the last 17 years of my life xxxx",2019-11-21 23:45:15
dzqjla,"Hi Amy! 

I loved how the orchestra versions of songs in Synthesis kind of morphed the tone and emotion, at least for me. Did you find that doing a softer instrumentation compared to the old versions changed how you interpreted the song, even after years of doing it?

Thanks for doing this. I've been a lifelong fan, literally, thanks to my dad. I was able to see you and the band last summer in NJ and it was incredible ❤️",2019-11-21 23:45:52

Did you and the band plan everything about the cover? Was it an old idea, or something new someone asked you to work on??? This is gonna be so sick! 
I wish I could see the tour in April. I’m still so shocked you guys are touring together... definitely giving power to the tour name...

dzqjla,"Hello Amy! I hope you and your family are doing well! Here are my questions ^_^:

1) Many Evanescence fans who were in high school in 2003/2004 really connected to where you were with your music then, and have grown with you over the years. Has it been cool to grow with that core of your fan base? Watching fans once lost also finding happiness and having families of their own?

2) Have you ever listened to composers Two Steps From Hell? If not, I believe you would love them! They create instrumental symphonic masterpieces.

3) Which Evanescence song would you say is the definitive Evanescence song? The one song that could define the music and feel of the band? 

Thank you! 😊",2019-11-22 00:01:47

I know in 2016, you came out with a boxed vinyl set of new and old Evanescence songs. Any chance we can have CD or MP3 versions of those songs? 

PS: I fell in love with Evanescence since 2003, ever since I heard Going Under and Bring Me to Life played on the radio just once! Loved your music since then. It has gotten me through so many tough times in life (including stage 3 cancer in 2017, and the passing of my father). Can’t wait to see what you and your band will come up with next. Lots of love! 💕",2019-11-22 00:06:08
dzqjla,"hi!

i saw evanescence in concert for the first time on may 5th in florida :) it was the best experience i’ve had and i felt so powerful and happy after. i love hearing you sing~ i wrote my college application essay about it. wish me luck hehe ❤️

before you performed ‘lost in paradise’, you were talking about feeling broken when you have so much pressure on you to reach expectations, how it’s okay to ‘fall apart’. it truly spoke to me~

during this time, what coping mechanisms did you use to feel better? what makes you feel better when you feel broken?

evanescence helps a lot~ ‘lost in paradise’ has made me cry but i think that’s a beautiful part about it. it’s a song i can relate to, and that feels rare!

also, i love within temptation so much and was so excited when the ‘worlds collide’ tour was announced. i cannot travel to europe but i’m so happy you and sharon interact with each other. 💕

lastly, i wanted to say thank you for being you. you inspire me so much and i adore you~ you’ve had a huge impact on my life in only the span of a year; i cannot put it into words. i hope you know we love you and the band so so much. thank you for the work you all put in and for always staying true to yourself and your art.

thank you! i love you again~
i hope you all have a nice day 💗",2019-11-22 00:06:12

How far is it in your minds to do something like Anywhere but Home again? Live albums arent easy, but it was indeed a masterpiece of live music. I did like some of Synthesis' songs but I feel like it didnt come close to AbH. 😁

 The lead up to them takes you on an uphill Journey as the song progresses. Once its gotten your senses and emotions fully on board at Its Peak.... You guide us off the Edge into free fall face first into your perfectly combined instrumental arrangements and vocals that's absolutely euphoric.

I wanted to ask - How do you feel about all the journey of yours growing as a musician and as a person? 
Also (and this question is out of the blue) - Many years ago I agreed with your opinion about pop singers in the industry - that they are fake and cheesy and slutty. Do you still believe that?
Sometimes I do think that it is still true and sometimes I don't think that it's accurate to everyone. Also nowadays I believe that maybe some of them love to express their sexuality. What do you think?
And last one: When are you going to share the full version of 'your love'? (Haha I know many people would love to know) 
LOVE U💜

dzqjla,"Hi Amy, I’m so excited to hear the new cover of The Chain! I’m in my late teens now and ever since I was a little girl, I loved your music. You are one of the first people that inspired me to play music and rock on. I play multiple instruments but my main instrument is guitar.  

Anyways, I just wanted to ask you what inspired you to start taking piano lessons? And who or what inspired you to sing? You have such a beautiful, powerful, and unique voice, so it would be cool to know the inspiration behind your voice. 
 
Also, I’m kind of curious of what the new album will sound like. Is it similar in any ways to any of your past albums or is it going to be something completely different? Either way I’m super excited to hear the new album!💕 

I’m really looking forward to the Worlds Collide Tour!! Please consider adding Canadian dates and even US dates because I am dying to see you and your amazing band play, in addition to Within Temptation. I will definitely get meet and greet tickets whenever you and your band come down to Toronto, or anywhere near there. Much love from Canada!!🇨🇦❤️All the best!!",2019-11-22 01:43:39

Edit: I should add that I was lucky enough to see you on the open door tour back in 2007? It was the best moment of my life. I have the tour shirt still. All my choir solos were your songs. Most recently have been doing Smule duets with a girl who loves your music just as much as I! Your music played endlessly throughout my life. Car. Stereo. Phone. I can’t really explain how grateful I am for your music and helping me process a lot of grief and sadness and angst. Thank you...! Hope to see you in Ontario again one day ❤️🖤",2019-11-22 02:33:08

dzqjla,"At least once a week, and during the early oughts more like once a day, I hear “do you know you look just like that chick from Evanescence?” lol I always take it as a pretty high compliment. 😊(https://imgur.com/gallery/1gqlJiS)",2019-11-22 15:08:20
dzqjla,Holy shit how did I miss this!! I love her so much 😭💕,2019-11-22 15:50:11
dzqjla,"Hi Amy, the first thing I would like to say is thank you for your music. It helps me get through every day in my life, I’m 16.
In 2017 I heard Bring Me to Life as a background for the youtube video (of course I knew this song) and immediately fell in love with piano and your voice. I started to look for more Evanescence songs, like Going Under, My Immortal, Lost in Paradise. Evanescence very quickly became my favourite and the most important band. Lyrics are beautiful and I identify with them. Evanescence began my story with rock and metal music. Thanks to You Amy, I found my passion - playing piano. In February of 2019 I bought a keyboard and started to learn the rhythm of My Immortal for one hand. Then I’ve added a second hand, and now  I can play Hello, My Immortal, Lithium, Your Star, Good Enough, My Heart is Broken, Overture and Unraveling Interlude from Synthesis :) My dream is meet You someday and tell you about it all, be on a concert (I’m from Poland). You are my idol and inspiration. THANK YOU. Time for questions!  Which Evanescence song is the hardest to sing live and what cities are your favourite? One thing more: The Chain sounds amazing!!! 🖤",2019-11-21 23:16:25
dzqjla," Amy,  
during the last tour you told the crowd, many times, that Lost in Paradise is about the relinquishing of control, we need to have the feelings, give ourselves the permission to fall apart, because that's the only way we can stand up stronger and live our life.  
On 2 sept you guys were in Verona, and I was recovering from a terrible summer.. and on the ""run away, run away"" moment of Lip I fell apart. ♥ and that was a moment I will never forget, because I was able to feel myself again and I had been numb for months.  
But at the Ev concert we all get in touch with our most intimate and vulnerable part, and the Synthesis Tour was pretty intense! and I love that. Maybe this is the thing that made me all in love with you so much in the past years. I was a little girl when I heard BMTL for the first time in 2003.... im 28 now.  
Im grateful for living the same world you, Amy, and all the band are living. This is a special gift to me.  
We are one ♥

thank you for everything.  
and THE CHAIN is incredible!!!!!! ♥ ♥ ♥ keep on rocking  
love you,  
Nicole",2019-11-21 23:04:12
dzqjla,"Hi Miss Amy! (IDK if my question posted the first time so I'll write it here) I can't believe I'm the age you were when Fallen came out! I've been listening to you since I was 12! Before I ask my question, I just want to say thank you for everything you've done. For making music, for being a guest on Cartoon Cartoon Fridays on Cartoon Network, you seem very nice, and thank you for just being a really lovely person! Evanescence has been there for me for a lot of my life and whenever I listened to your music, or watched the DVD, or YouTube videos, or behind the scenes stuff it was nice. It was like I had a second home when I couldn't stand being in my actual house. It helped me survive. And I'll always be grateful for it. ❤️❤️❤️❤️

MY QUESTIONS ARE: How have your views changed since you started making music? About anything! Like, about music, or life, or the industry? What are some things you learned just going through life and experiencing the things you have?

Oh! And if you could go back and do something different about a music video, what would you do differently? Like in the concept, or the cinematography, or the song choice, or something?",2019-11-21 23:14:31
dzqjla,"1. How are and the guys doing?
2. 😬 are we going to hear choral arrangements in some the new songs?",2019-11-21 23:05:19
dzqjla,"Amy! Thank you for doing this. We love and appreciate you. Anyway, I do have a question about Evanescence's new album in the works. Can you tell us anything about what may be inspiring this new project? What is fueling this creative process? ♥️",2019-11-21 23:03:47
dzqjla,"Hey Amy, a big fan from Turkey here! First of all, thank you for doing this Q&A! I love you and the band so much, and it was AWESOME getting to hear you guys live in Istanbul! It was such a great show. If you noticed a headbanded boy during Imaginary, it's probably me :D I have a few questions that I wanted to ask:

1. Was there a song that you wanted to re-record for Synthesis, and decided not to? And is there any chance we get Imperfection rock version as a studio recording, preferably as a bonus song on the next album?

2. You did a full acoustic set last tour, and we loved it! Would you think of making an acoustic tour/album someday?

3. What do you do to preserve your voice while touring? Your voice was awesome last tour and it barely got exhausted I guess.

4. What is the sound of the album gonna be like, and which album do you think it will sound close to?

5. Bonus question: Which one is harder for you to sing, ""Never Go Back"" or ""End of the Dream?"" :D

Thank you so much, we love you! ♡ ❤",2019-11-21 23:05:33

dzqjla,"Hi Amy, how are you?
Just want to ask about the new material you all worked on the past months, for the Ev5. Are this materials all new compositions or there are some stuff never released from the past years being reworked? 
Will ""The Chain"" be a Bonus Track on The next album?

Greetings From Brazil ❤️",2019-11-21 23:10:35
dzqjla,"Hi Amy, i love Evanescence since the beginning, bmtl on the radio 😱🤘🥰 The album will be an album or more singles? There will be a physical cd or just mp3?

dzqjla," 

Hello Amy! Firstly my BIRTHDAY will be 11-25 and I will be VERY HAPPY if you answer me. It will be a gift for me!

I want to say I love you and everyone from Evanescence, and I love how the band is constantly evolving.  
My only question is: How does the band tackle these new challenges, as it were, because on each album, each discography has a totally different follow-up to the previous one and it's amazing! It's perfect, sublime !!! It's like a constant metamorphosis and I don't see any other alternative metal bands being as wonderful as you!  

I wish the band success in this new project.

Thank you for existing and saving so many lives with your songs 💜",2019-11-21 23:37:03

dzqjla,That’s so dope. It’s a perfect song and I’m grateful for it💕,2019-11-21 23:26:13
dzqjla,"Imaginary is my favourite song from you guys (although all your songs are so amazing. You make it nearly impossible to even pick a favourite) but Imaginary has a very special place in my heart because it helped me a lot. I was bullied all throughout 1st-7th grade and I hated going to school so much that I would spend every second I possibly could dreaming away in my own little safe world or get lost in books and movies. I preferred to live in fiction than to live in reality. For me, Imaginary describes a lot of my feelings during that time very well and it has definitely helped to work out some of the traumatic memories. Thank you so much for this song Amy. It really means a lot to me❤",2019-11-22 00:22:17
dzqjla,you are brilliant on Never Go Back and tEOTD!! especially on the Synthesis versions ♥,2019-11-22 00:13:16
dzqjla,I just want you to know that I knew several young girls in the early 2000s who would listen to your album on repeat in order to express some very painful emotions. I believe that album saved a lot of lives. ❤️,2019-11-22 02:05:24

w9bzjk,"Hey man, you're probably tired of people telling you stories about how they rickrolled someone, but here's mine. It's pretty cool because I rickrolled an IT professional with his own blog post.

It was April Fool's Day, and I had already rickrolled him three times, so he was on guard. It would take great subterfuge to trick him again. This was even more true now that he was refusing to click links that I'd removed the link preview from.

He occasionally made professional blog posts for the IT company he worked for. So, I found one of his posts... Sent the link to myself to get the link preview... Screencapped the link preview... Noted how the URL ended... Made that the ending on a rickroll spoof URL... and sent the screenshot of the link preview along with the spoofed URL and the remark, ""Uhm, the last paragraph on this one... Did you have a stroke? 🤣""

I was relying on him reacting too quickly to notice the first half of the URL was wrong. He shortly replied with,

""You...

WHAT??!""


Me: 'The paragraph about advanced features. It has a pretty epic typo.""

Him: ""This was in response to your filthy little trick. 
You really did some research for that one, I'm impressed.""

Me: ""The part where it goes, ""debug I'm no stranger to love...""

I rickrolled him six times that day, including traps I had laid for others in group chats. Thanks to you, I have that. It's one of my proudest accomplishments.

Anyway, since that incident, the IT developer and I have started dating. I like to think it helped. :)",2022-07-28 09:47:16

The lyrics are extremely complex and without a solid grasp of the Fibonacci sequence most of the words will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Tool's uncommon time signatures which is deftly woven into their characterization - Maynard's personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these songs, to realize that they're not just music- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Tool truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Maynard's famous song ""Hooker With A Penis, "" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Maynard James Keenan's genius unfolds itself on their record players. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have an Ænima tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

im6q1x,"Just a few years out of work can really set back a career. Even 1 year for maternity leave in the US is a huge setback in a lot of careers - and affects career growth opportunities. Couple this with careers that have accreditation or continuing education requirements, or related to quickly changing technologies or regulatory rules, or client based work where you lose your connections after leaving the workforce.... it is really a huge sacrifice to stay home with the kids. In most cases, I would say it is a greater sacrifice than being the sole income (especially since most women who stay at home with kids end up being responsible for the majority of domestic chores because childcare is not seen as equivalent to a job).

Some of the Best music experiences i have ever had in my life have been in the last year in VR. To watch the space evolve so quickly is so refreshing and makes me so happy every time i get to see a new map or hear a new set from someone that just started to learn, to other DJs that have 10+ years of experience. I'm truly greatfull to everyone that makes it happen🐻.

I just want to know your thoughts on what is next for the space. Currently there is so many new things popping up, it can be hard to keep track of all of it, but for now it is still mostly a small community with limited funds and staffing. 

Could we start to see more main stream music artist coralaborating with programmers and 3D artist to create more experiences that blow us away?? (Like you did for Secret Sky VR)

Currently Muzz (a UK D&B DJ) is doing a VR tour, could we start to see this gain more traction with others?

First, congrats on releasing Nurture! I'm sure you're extremely proud of the work you put into it, and a lot of fans are happy for you.

Now for my questions: 

1. What inspired the long intro of dullscythe? I'm sure it has meaning behind it since you included it on the final album, but I'm not entirely sure what it is.

You talked a lot about musical hero’s in your YouTube interview and I genuinely can say YOU are one of my musical hero’s 🥺💜💙 
But my question for you is:
You spoke a lot about how you found your self being insecure about your music on social media and how you were kind of trapped in these negative thought loops. I would just like to know what you think helps you get through those negative thoughts the most? I guess what is your advice for someone who is also insecure and tends to hold herself back?

Just one question from me, it's about Wind Tempos specifically. 

The final section to the song features what sounds to be mouse clicks/key presses. Was there any specific reason for those to be there? if so why were these included?

I am so honored to have known you and would love for you to know how much you mean to me ♥️ Nick, Mark, Robert, from Oreo Graveyard to Babylonian to Amorphia to Rbnsn you all have given me strength to carry on.

n192mk,"Hey Porter!! I love Nurture so much! I'm curious about do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do, how did it come to be and would you ever possibly showcase or deconstruct a project? I'd love to see stuff from Nurture showcased.


I also have to say I'm really proud of you and how this album came out. Blossom made me SO EMOTIONAL and Musician is something I heavily relate to. Every song is beautiful and I love you and your music very very much. ❤️❤️❤️❤️",2021-04-29 18:08:31
n192mk,"Hi Porter! Much love. I've got a question from the production side of things.

What are some of your favorite VSTs right now? Any that were vital on Nurture?

I also really want to start singing on my tracks and i wanted to know what kind of FX chain you used for the vocal processing on Nurture, but i understand if that's kinda like your trade secret you don't wanna give away. 😅

Anyway, thanks for existing, for your music, and for this AMA, in that order.",2021-04-29 18:09:15

I’m looking forward to attending your Secret Sky festival this fall! 

I’m an avid festival goer and electronic music lover. Will you ever consider attending and headlining at other major festivals again? Feels like it’s been forever since I’ve last seen you in that scene. Or is this transition in style and scene going to be evergreen?",2021-04-29 18:10:21

2. Did 1975 inspire any of the songs on Nurture? I feel like I can hear the influence in a few, Mother especially.
3. What's that beeping noise in the left speaker on Sweet time at 1:19-1:26? It sounds like the one on the snare in Mother. Morse Code? 👀 

I feel like I have way too many questions and I can't remember most of them right now lol. you're my lifelong inspiration, love you man

n192mk,"Hi just wanted to let you know that after seeing your Shelter tour at the Shrine in Nov 2016,  you’ve changed my entire life and I realized that liking anime (which was something I’ve been ashamed of) could actually be cool. 

Another memorable moment was when I saw your Snapchat story of a Vocaloid concert and it was like the same way of a fan would film one of your concerts and it was just the most incredible and touching thing I’ve witnessed. Thank you so much for creating music that inspire millions of people, the world is a much more beautiful place with your existence ❤️

(My dream is to one day arrange a piano medley of the evolution of your music to see your growth as a musician)

Alright on to the questions since I’ve been simping too hard

1. What is your favourite Vocaloid producer? (Mine is Kz/livetune)
2. Particle Arts is one of my top 5 favourite EDM songs, what is the story behind it? Was there a particular mood/setting you were trying to recreate with it?
3. Something Comforting was released right when the pandemic happened, was that just a coincidence? I used to listen to it 10x a day during the beginning of lockdown, it really helped make things better.",2021-04-29 18:24:03
n192mk,"hi porter!! Thanks so much for doing this, and congrats on releasing nurture! Cant wait to see you again live for the 7th time at the upcoming second sky ❤️

n192mk,"Hi Porter! 

I wanted to ask this question on your SiriusXM interview the other day but didn't get the chance, You mentioned in the past that you were in a musical depression and failed to make any music that you deemed good. Do you remember that epiphany moment when you realized that you could make music and that everything was okay again? 💕💕💕💕",2021-04-29 18:27:44
n192mk,"Hiya Porter, Nurture is staggeringly touching. I *almost* can't listen to blossom because it impacts me in the same tearful way each time. Thank you from the bottom of my musician heart for being true to yourself ♥️.

Speaking of, I have been playing drums since I was 10 and singing since I was 8 (25 now), and I'm in the works of finally writing and recording the first album with my dearest bass player friend (Hard rock with disco and dance/pop sensibility). As a young teenager, I arrogantly held a purist view that if music wasn't recorded in an analog and acoustic medium, it wasn't ""real"". I was an edgy teenager dealing with things, and tldr I realized how much of a troubled and pissed off fool I was being. Since 16 and certainly now, I hold an equal affinity to electronic music that I do for all other genres and forms, and it's liberating.

So my question! From a melodic and rhythmic understanding, I'm able to formulate my musical ideas in a way that is fulfilling to me (in particular with other people), but I have long had a desire to start making solely my own electronic music, and I have my influences that effect me in an inspiring and profound way (you're in that club boi). I'm working on getting my piano abilities in order lol, but as generally or specific as you'd like to be, what are some words of wisdom you would impart to me and anyone else (in particular people who are already musicians) that could be a guiding light to finding one's voice in an electronic realm vs. the ""real"" realm? I wish you, your family, your friends, and Rika happiness and good health. Thank you, Porter!",2021-04-29 18:28:52
n192mk,"No question just wanted to say congrats on the new album. I love it. :) 

I had the chance to see you play Worlds at The Gorge in 2017 and it will forever be one of my top life experiences. Thank you for being you and doing all that you do. ❤️",2021-04-29 18:32:56
n192mk,"Hi Porter, your music saved my life years ago and this new album deff came at the right time as I’m currently going through a lot, so THANK YOUU😊

n192mk,"I just ran across this post while listening to your new album, specifically the song ""Look at the Sky."" It just ended as I'm typing this lol. Just wanted to say thank you! You're easily my favorite artist, probably of all time. The meaning and stories you put into your music is like something I've never seen before, and I hope your music will live on until the end of time, like Pink Floyd. It will for me, at least! 💕",2021-04-29 18:38:36
n192mk,"Just wanna say I lost somebody recently and your song “Blossom” really helped me work through my emotions. The lyrics generally helped me deal with my relationship with myself and with other people.

I cried at the piano learning the chords and It was one of the first times that I cried where it wasn’t just sadness, nor happiness either but something else. I just appreciate you a lot, going outside your comfort zones and writing a ballad type song like that really changed my life, can’t thank you enough. 

1. What was it like wiring ballads after not doing that type of music (as far as I know)... Did you have to write a lot of other ballad songs before you got Blossom etc.


2. Would you ever work with blackwinterwells or 8485???

Cause I hear you in their work. They are some of my favorite artists right now and it would be a dream come true to see you 3 collaborate. I know you would make something truly special together.

Thanks 🖤 Keep Being Awesome

n192mk,"Hey Porter!!! Huge longtime fan :3 I love Nurture more than I even thought I would and congrats on its release!!
Your Secret Sky performance was for lack of a better word - EPIC. I wasn’t with you in person but could feel your energy in your performance!

Was it difficult to bring yourself to sing the vocals in front of everyone? I know you have done some singing for parts in older songs during previous sets (like sad machine) but you sang for an hour straight! Was that difficult for you? Did it take a lot of practice? and is that practice where the idea for Do-re-me-fa-so-la-to-do come from?
Not sure if this all was asked already but super curious as an aspiring bedroom producer (NURTURE IS SO INSPIRING!) 
Anyway, much love and thank you for saving my life, Porter!!!! ❤️❤️❤️",2021-04-29 18:41:20
n192mk,"i’ve really loved nurture, musician especially has helped me a lot in a really dark and difficult past couple of months. i can’t thank you enough for all the good memories you and your music have given me over the past few years.

i was just curious, what type of microphone do you use to record your vocals in studio for nurture? i’m always really curious about artists’ gear and i wondered if it was anything in particular or if the vocal processing kind of rendered any specific mic superfluous

second question, if it’s ok, do you have any tips for someone who wants to try songwriting but can’t really write melodies? i feel like i can’t string together an “original” sequence of notes in my head, and it’s kind of gotten me down

much love from michigan!! your secret sky set was AMAZING 💙",2021-04-29 18:46:32

n192mk,"Not a question, but a compliment/ kudos 

I’ve been following you and your music for a while and read all of your tweets and idk if you’ll see this but your growth has really shown in your mental health. 

I remember you tweeting a while back about how you came to the realization that the reason you make music is to make others feel the same delight as when you listen to your favorite songs/ other artists. 

After that tweet I saw your depression go away and a new awakening of loving creating music and allowing the chance for others to feel that through your music. 

This new album really shows that and I could not be more proud of you/ honored to follow in your journey of mental health and seeing things go up from here. 

Congrats Porter 💚💚

Anyway the question fancied approaching a different topic of sorts: in all honesty where do you imagine you would be without your current successful career, seeing as you started so young I imagine it's hard to really know. Either way what do you imagine you're cureent career path would have been if you decided to quit the music scene or even never attempt to enter it.

I was wondering if you had any tips on capturing emotion through music? You do it so well and I’d love any tips, as I’m struggling to make songs that feel like ‘myself’ for lack of a better term.

n192mk,"Hey Porter! First, I want to say thank you for doing what you do. I've been such a huge fan since I first discovered the I'm On Fire a decade ago. Every era of your music has inspired me in a different way.

I'm curious though what the process of creating the Virtual Self project was like. I've never seen a project with so much intentional work put into every single aspect like VS. How long did it take to flesh out the ""lore"", the virtual aesthetic, and the release, and was it something you knew from the start how it should look, or did it kind of come together in the process?

I recently made a [Virtual Self Cassette Tape](https://twitter.com/byllogan/status/1363257362853687301?s=19) for my collection, and while working on it, and studying the art book, and digging through stuff like the HTML on the website looking for clues, and easter eggs (likr the ASCII images in the coding 😉), I was just so taken back by how perfectly put together it all was. (Also, is there any way I could send you one of these tapes? I've saved one incase I ever got the opportunity)

And final question - As I'm sure you can assume, I'm pretty passionate about cassettes. Any plans for tape releases in the future? I love making up my own, but Id love to support you and get official ones if given the chance!


Also, random anecdote: years ago you headlined a festival in Oklahoma, Backwoods Festival. That year I'd won a dj competition and got to perform, and I managed to use my stages pass to sneak backstage  main stage (even though I was told specifically I couldn't lol) While I was waiting for the chance to catch you and say hi, I got recruited to help with stage props, and had to fake like I knew what I was doing and I ended up finding an actual all access pass that I swiped lmao. At the last second before your set I was heading back to the crowd and I saw you walking up and I gave you a custom flash drive after saying hi. It really meant so much to me how kind you were, like it even seemed like you'd be late for your set to take a picture. After your show I snuck my girlfriend back stage and had the opportunity to talk about Childish Gambino, and anime and other bullshit for a minute. That's easily the greatest memory I have, and it's my favorite story to tell. It was so special to me how humble and kind you were.",2021-04-29 19:44:52
n192mk,"Congrats on Nurture, was even better than i expected~

I guess as a bit of a gear head i must ask what instruments/equipment you used for the nurture live set?  🤔

Also I was at the last show in the worlds live tour :') it was one of the best nights of my entire life. Thank you for everything that you do, I greatly admire and appreciate your art.

I’m so happy with Nurture, I feel like it came into my life at the perfect time. I listen to it front to back almost everyday now. 

Anyways my favorite track I think at the moment has to be “Wind Tempos” that song sends me on a journey and I love every second of it. So I was wondering how you came up with it and what was the inspiration behind it?  Also absolutely obsessed with the vocal chops towards the end. It makes me feel alive! 

Thanks again for making beautiful music, the world needs you ❤️",2021-04-29 20:07:18

Thanks for doing this AMA! Me and my girlfriend have been fans for a while. My girlfriend’s first concert was your performance in Melkweg, the Netherlands, in 2014. What an amazing concert. Thanks for all the great music throughout the years and congrats on the great new album!

As for my question, what has moved and/or inspired you the most since Worlds and (how) did this influence the new record?

Thanks again, hope to see you live again soon! ❤️",2021-04-29 20:09:24

I was heartbroken when it was cancelled back in 2014, we never got to experience any of it live, Sea of voices, the insane Flicker edits, Say my name and Sheperdess... I was planning on getting a tattoo of it once I heard it for myself and not from phone recording but it sadly never happened.

Thank you for Nurture. It is wonderful, beautiful in every form. My favorite thing is hearing your keyboard and mouse tweaking the sounds live, it  is the most concrete way to convey that it is not only the music that matters, but that YOU managed to create it. It’s beautiful. Thank you for all ❤️",2021-04-29 20:14:23

1) Firstly, are you gonna do a tour/festival in the UK anytime soon after COVID dies down? I just wanna see you live so badly 🥺

2) What are the steps/process that you take in order to convey the emotion you deliver in your songs. It's difficult to describe, but majority of your works (especially within Nurture) come across as incredibly emotionally atmospheric and give a sense of presence within a large space. Not sure if this is intentional or not, but if it is, I was just curious as to how you are able to achieve this, as it's my personal favourite aspect of your music.",2021-04-29 20:33:53

Wish you were back in Vegas doing shows. Will that be happening again in the future?

Thanks for being a solid inspiration to us creatives. Currently working on an EP I’ve been writing for a few years now. Have others involved now and spending money on production. It’s starting to get stressful.
I feel like I’ve put so much into it and I’m afraid it’s going to be for nothing. Like it may flare up for a bit and then just float away. Have you been in what’s felt like a ‘make-it-or-break-it’ season that you’ve been pushing through and feeling absolutely discouraged to where the last 20% of production is starting to suffer due to lack of drive/ambition/inspiration/creativity/vision? If so, how did you embrace those feelings and use them as momentum to finish strong versus finishing weak?

🤫🤫

> And I guess, top tips on overcoming imposter syndrome? I guess the album tells that story, but seeing as you're a veteran of dealing with imposter syndrome would love your tips and techniques for dealing with it.

there's two things i'd say here:

**1) everyone feels their own work has a bit of a 'stank' on it lol**

my younger brother mark used this phrase while looking at his own design once: ""you know everything you make kinda has that 'stank' on it?"". i've carried that with me a lot. it's just something you can't get away from. you can never hear your own music for the first time. same goes for any creative field

**2) you're comparing your insides to everyone else's outsides**

comparison is a dangerous game anyway, but it's also almost impossible to do with any degree of accuracy or real perspective.

i talk about instagram this way a lot: in your feed, you see other people's photos after they've posed with the intention of being photographed, with selected lighting, they've taken 400 photos and chosen the most flattering one, and then adjusted colors and often times used beauty apps. and there's another degree of ""filtration"" there -- sometimes people take all of those steps and then don't post a photo.

it's a highlight reel of a highlight reel of a highlight reel of a highlight reel.

and then you compare that to your own face when it accidentally pops up in the forward-facing camera.  lol 

making music is like that. artists tend to show the best 5% of their work. that's why it's better to have compassion for yourself as you're being creative rather than judging the thing you're doing. that's your insides YA GOTTA LOVE IT",2021-04-29 17:56:14

I think it boils down to Pink Floyd being greater than the sum of its parts. 

Roger was phenomenal at concepts and lyrics. David and Rick were themselves phenomenal at music and composition. 

Putting the three of them together made epic soundscapes and melody that no band achieved before or since. 

Rog needed Dave and Rick to help flesh out his ideas with good music. His solo stuff was too deep and without decent melody, minus a few individual tracks here and there.

nzzngp,"Well you’re editing your previous comments to totally change the context of the thread, so I must’ve said something right. To be honest I read it as a complete troll attempt, apologies for calling you a jumped up prick but I felt that was a fair response. 

It’s not just conservatives who can’t stand self-important, preachy ultra-left politics. It’s pretty much anyone who isn’t in that club and who recognises the paper thin surface value of it - it’s not that they care about these issues, it’s that they want to be *seen* to care for their own popularity. 

What’s more, is that Roger Waters’ preachings are not earned - he has never walked a day in the shoes of a poor person. He’s been rich and extremely privileged practically his whole life based on the capitalist system he claims to be against. Like I mentioned earlier - He beat the audience over the head with anti-capitalism rants between songs, changed the meaning of songs to be about current politics, told the audience to go out and tear down the system, then charged £40 for cheap looking t shirts made in China, most likely by impoverished child labour. Disgusting levels of hypocrisy. I smashed the system my own way that night and bought a shirt from a bootlegger who is just trying to make ends meet instead of funding a multi-millionaire with a god complex.

I disagree on the political messages in Floyd albums though. Personally I’ve always found them to be on a much more artistically abstract level than to stoop to just writing music about politics. That’s easy to do and they’re better than that. The Wall and Wish You Were Here are about the fickle music industry turning people into products, not politics. (Well, The Wall is also about haunting personal traumas and gradually resigning from a world you’ve lost touch with, but that album is too deep to even begin mining in a single comment).

At least we both love Floyd though, there’s at least something we can agree on 😂",2021-06-15 09:49:12

xuqppl,"Hi Corey! Thank you so much for doing this. Have loved Slipknot for almost 15 years now and I hope when you guys tour again in the States you swing back around to Houston, TX!  


My question is; why do 'Yen' and 'De Sade' sound so damn sexy? I may be in the minority with this opinion but those tracks seem to tap into the darker, more primal side of lust, wanting, desire, etc. and I have been enamored by them (as well as my fave track on the album, 'Finale'). Did you guys notice that while making the songs or at the completion of them?

Do you have any plans to try and make Knotfest U.K. happen after unfortunately being originally scheduled for 2020?

Slipknot have a history of bringing interesting younger talent or overlooked/under appreciated bands on the extreme end of the spectrum. What bands would you be interested in bringing on tour with you that fit those moulds?

Did you have a hand in the organisation of the recent Pulse Of The Maggot’s festival in Birmingham this past august? If so, what other newer bands from the U.K. metal scene would you be interested in seeing develop over the coming years?

Its the same with food. 

“Black” pride is weird as a first generation African in Canada but Ive come to accept that how others in North America see me. The more multicultural the area, people ask me what ethnicity I or my parents are. The more homogeneous or closer to the US border, people assume I know all things African American.

And yet you can still tell which ones are black and white, and use that determination to make statistically strong predictions about them. Because it's an incredibly strong indicator for region of ancestry, which obviously is strongly determinative of their genetic makeup.

The portions of your genetic code that determine skin color aren't the same ones that determine other things such as height, but there clearly are linkages due to genetic history.",2021-01-25 15:44:53

If you want to look up a quote for a different ISP, you wont be able to even go to their website. Why would comcast let me go to the website of their competitors? So, just look up the phone number? With what, the internet? Oh wait, They will block you from seeing their contact information.

r6ibn1,"0.5% Radiohead! Can’t believe I just started to really get into them and dig as deep as I could. I always get hooked on one artist/band and pretty much listen to them exclusively. Late 2020/2021 was Radiohead. I was on a Tame impala journey for a while, and saw that Rick Beato did a video on Paranoid android. I knew I found something that hit that spot I can’t explain when it comes to music. Obsessed with Radiohead ever since. 

In Rainbows and a Moon Shaped Pool are seriously some of the best albums I’ve ever listened to and are already some of the most important albums of mine. The band is really something else and I don’t think we’ll ever get something quite like them again. I hope to god they can drop another album or two. Maybe a real hard one in the vein of Bodysnatchers, or another reinvention of themselves like Kid A or Rainbows. But AMSP would be a great note to end on and it would make sense so I’m content with whatever they chose. Still have The Smile to look fawned too!

This band means so much to me and I’ve only been a real fan for a year and a half maybe. If you haven’t listened to Radiohead yet, I’m obviously obsessed lol, but I guarantee some of their stuff will at least blow your mind! 

Ok Computer is legendary and will prob have some hits you’ve heard, In Rainbows is kinda what represents them and all they’ve done and how great they are in my opinion. But don’t sleep on Moon Shaped Pool, it’s their newest album but I think one of the greatest and best on the ears they’ve done this far. It’s top level immersive and depressing, the one you’d most likely cry to out of all their records, if music brings deep emotions out of you, I’ve never heard anything like it. 

But every album is a treat and you can really put them on repeat and dissect all songs for hours and hours. They’re one of those bands.

662nay,"I haven't listened to them in years, but looking back at this album track list there's so many great songs to pick from-Brianstorm, Teddy Picker, Balaclava, Fluorescent Adolescent, Old Yellow Bricks that I think maybe that's the reason people say 505 is overrated? Compared to the rest of the tracks I can see why they would say that. This isn't even mentioning any songs off of Whatever People Say I Am.....These first two albums are full of amazing songwriting, but to me specifically 505 was such a beautiful change of pace (plus the way Alex sings ""But I crumble completely when you cry"" just kills me) Again, I haven't heard them in years and I don't know what they're up to now as far as their sound goes but 505 hits me the same time after all these years.

If you want to use the recording in a movie, you're using the recording ℗ of the performance ©, so you need permission from copyright owners of both ℗ & ©",2018-12-27 06:02:17

9zsjxl,"Totally agree and if you ever have a chance, read what didn't make it on there.. I know for sure at least  ""Silver Spring"" was left off by Mick because they ""already had 4 Stevie written songs ( didn't want another ballad ) and trying to be fair to Lindsey and the group..those egos. 🙄  (in fairness, gold dust woman (*fun fact gold dust woman about the groupies), gypsy, landslide and dreams all outstanding choices).
Stevie has talked about how pissed she was the song was put aside for years. If you've ever watched their concert ""The Dance"", she's talked about how (obviously) many of her songs were aimed at her failed relationship w Lindsey. In ""Silver Spring"", she sings the song directly at him ( common for shows but Stevie hadn't performed this and this was a direct rebuke of Lindsey) with words like.. "" I'll follow you down until the sound of my voice will haunt you. You can never get away from the sound of the woman that loved you"". She later said it was therapeutic to finally be able to say those words to him. What an insane dynamic those two had (of course the rest of the group too. Mick and Stevie. John and Christine ) led to such incredible music. Lindsey clearly enjoyed telling her to ""Go your own way"". Wish I could write music, or sing, play an instrument but otherwise I'm good lol. 
*Fun fact 2 ""The Chain"" is written by all members of the group (even John wrote the awesome bass-line toward the end).  ",2018-11-24 12:16:29

My intent was to poke fun at anyone who doesn’t support equal rights with a kind of f—ked up, but not terribly uncommon story, that was not a worse case scenario and ended with a little jab to hopefully cause any parent to consider that a conversion camp might not yield the result they hoped for.

I can't believe no one mentioned The Wall movie. In my opinion, it's the greatest music video of all time. Not only is the movie amazing, but they made slightly different versions of the songs. If you haven't checked out pink Floyd live at Pompeii, you need to. 

No other artist has even come close to making a feature length movie that's simply amazing to watch and hear.

At 19 yrs old, in the late 70's, I (white chick) went on a date with a black dude, I was visiting family in Springfield MA and he was a friend of theirs. 

We went out and at the first club we decided to go to, we couldn't even get out of the car. I opened my door, totally oblivious to what he knew instantly from the body language of crowd standing around in the parking lot, and as he turned to me and said ""Let's go somewhere else"" I noticed the crowd was moving toward his car, starting to yell shit at us. 

He wasn't uncomfortable because there were a lot of white people there. It was a mix of black & white. It wasn't because of the demographics at all, it was the very real vibe the crowd gave off that we, as a **couple** were not going to have a good time, to say the least, if we got out of that car.

>Funny how you “Mens rights” people only seem to care about “mens rights” when you’re using it to attack feminism.

How about you give me some of **your** takes instead of mindlessly repeating propaganda and information you've been told to think? 

Pointing out there is a **severe** lack of conversation about Men's rights despite the over whelming amount of discussion about the plight of women *isn't* an attack on feminism. 

You talk about how I'm a ""textbook pseudo intellectual"" meanwhile that is clearly projection. You're the one who is acting arrogant in the face of logical arguments and what pray tell is your counter arguments? 

Oh right, ad hominem and other personal attacks against my character. Bringing up my post history and the fact I *dared* to downvote you. 

Face it you don't have any *actual* arguments here aside from immature posturing and boy does it show. 

>Just accept you’re a misogynist. Much easier than trying to convince people your arguments are based in anything else.

Sorry but worrying about male suffering doesn't magically mean I'm a misogynist. That's just just the common retort from bigots like yourself who can't bother to be proven wrong so they resort to personal attacks. 

It's honestly quite pathetic. 

>~~I did enjoy you accepting your maths were infact wrong~~[Blatant lie removed] and morphing the point into something totally different.

I like how in addition to lying through your teeth (I never said my math was wrong because it wasn't), you are claiming I'm ""morphing the point"" when that isn't true in the slightest and anyone who could read the English language could see such. 

We're talking about money, not esoteric numbers in the void. No shit 1 billion is a huge amount, *but so is tens of millions of dollars* to the vast majority of humans on this earth. 

Your argument relied on technicalities and ignoring the context. Don't project that bullshit on me please.

b9q6y0,I'll never forget when i heard the news.. Was 17 at the time struggling with my own alcoholism and addiction issues that got much worse before they got better over the next couple decades( clean n sober now😃). Kurt was a hero to me.. And most people would rather believe a far fetched conspiracy theory than the cold hard truth. I was one of them. In recent days I've changed my tune.. And realized that although so many of us wish he wouldn't have done that to himself.. He most likely did.. That being said Love did some really shady shit after the fact concerning the royalties on nirvana's music.. But let's face it.. She obviously struggles with her own demons. The biggest shame in it all is his daughter who missed out on so much.. And it seems like you can hear the pain in her music( which is not surprisingly really good),2019-04-05 20:39:02
b9q6y0,"Fucking damn dude. 

I’ve been an on again off again fan of Nirvana over the years (I guess who hasn’t) but this article really gave me a whole new perspective on Kurt Cobain. 

I used to sort of resent him for the way he went out. I’ve struggled with drug addiction and mental illness over the years; so seeing someone as talented as he was that achieved as much as he did essentially give up really fucked with me. 

But those added layers provided by Goldberg really gave me a fuller picture of who he was. He was really a person like whom I aspire to be in a lot of ways; while also learning from his shortcomings and considering the kind of impact society has on people with similar struggles.

TL;DR: Kurt really did steal rock back from the jocks and the assholes but I never looked at it that way before tho. He was truly a kindhearted martyr for all the outcasts of the world. 🤘",2019-04-06 04:06:09

b9q6y0,Btw the stomach issues had been corrected. He was still an addict but the stomach issue was fixed finally! The man was on the upswing in life. Its very ironic. Most ppl say he was murdered bc they love a juicy story. Its exciting to them. I WANT it to be a suicide because a childs mom having her dad killed bc he was about to divorce her is heartbreaking to me… but the evidence points to murder for hire. There is a mountain of it. Soaked in bleach presents facts straight from the horses mouths. The practice writings in courtneys bag the sttorney found and was then very upset in finding out she was being recorded. Come on ppl. Just look at the facts! The fact that he was an addict snd may have been suicidal is just 2 bricks on the side of suicide. A damn ghetto of bricks is on the side of murder for hire! Enough to prove it. The police botched it and didnt go back to try to right the wrong bc it would have caused heads to roll…  this case should not be grouped in with other conspiracy theories! Simply because the evidence overwhelmingly points to murder. The resl conspiracy should be ppl believing courtney didnt have him offed. 🙄,2023-07-13 19:08:31
b9q6y0,"Bloodstream heroin levels[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suicide_of_Kurt_Cobain&action=edit&section=7)

On April 14, 1994, the [Seattle Post-Intelligencer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Post-Intelligencer)reported that Cobain was ""high on heroin when he pulled the trigger"". The paper reported that the [toxicological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicological) tests determined that the level of morphine in Cobain's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter and that there was also evidence of [valium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam) in his blood. The report contained a quote from Dr. Randall Baselt of the Chemical Toxicological Institute, stating that Cobain's heroin level was at ""a high concentration, by any account"". He also stated that the strength of that dose would depend on many factors, including how habituated Cobain was to the drug. **Grant argues that Cobain could not have injected himself with such a dose and still have been able to pull the trigger.**[[9]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Kurt_Cobain#cite_note-hw-9)

That was the trip when I learned about Happy Days and who the Fonz was, I thought Steve was singing a praise song to their fans ""cuz you're the fans!"" and asked my parents why he kept saying fans so weirdly 😅

Really sad stuff. They'll forever be a personal favorite. Smash Mouth was a perfect 60s garage rock revival band, I'd argue the goofiness and camp was part of the genre and they did it well. Hope he can recover and find peace",2023-09-04 13:56:35

I recently dove into their entire catalogue and I was blown away by their first album.  It won't appeal to fans who only know their hits but for prog rockers... Roy Wood was one of a kind composer while Jeff Lynn perfectly fused pop with prog/orchestra.  It only really worked for their first few albums but when all is said and done I prefer the early ELO to the later hit machine they became.  Doesn't mean their hits suck.  Just a preference 

Final note:  Jeff Lynne was almost starting to feel guilty at one point believing that any song he wrote would end up a hit on the radio.  To test that, he wrote Hold On Tight To Your Dreams and through in some French verses 

It became a hit. 😂",2018-03-08 00:11:19

7su818,"44 and live music is my absolute real addiction. I see literally a hundred plus acts a year. It’s impossible for me to stick with only a few bands and a few genres or else music gets really stagnant.

I judge people harshly who say “music is crap these days” because they only hear the five songs repeated on big radio, and can’t take the two seconds to find a bigger broader world.

Spotify is my main music source for everyday, but my real sources of discovery are NPR Music, Audio Tree, and festival lineups. I like using those sources and then continuing with them through Spotify. Like yesterday, I listened to the BottleRock 2016 Spotify playlist and then went on separate tangents listening to San Fermin and Fantastic Negrito and Pharcyde.

And today I’m going to check out the music content of some of the less known acts playing at Coachella 2018 based on their lineup. And i have a weeks worth of tiny desk concerts on NPR’s YouTube to listen to.

I’m excited that the Decemberists got you excited. You should 💯 see them live. They are EXCEPTIONAL. I’ve seen them 3 times.

Keep your ears open and go down the new music rabbit hole with me. ",2018-01-25 17:14:41

Immediately went home and bought the album and started a deep love for everything they’ve done. Just last week tickets went on sale and we drained my bank account (which didn’t have much $ to begin with) to buy some, even though it comes immediately after a vacation we’ve been planning for a year and spending all of our extra money towards doing. Decemberists cannot be missed.  We’ve seen them at least six times since.

9x8ayj,"I know it’s a matter of musical preference but....

I always tell my kids that they are lucky to have parents who have very different musical tastes/influences that they get to hear music that a typical kid (in Italy where we live, we’re not Italians) wouldn’t be usually exposed to.

father: the four seasons, dion and the Belmonts, Rolling Stones, the verve, Kraftwerk, Elvis....,

me/mother: the Beatles, smashing pumpkins, Radiohead, Mozart/Beethoven/classical piano, bee gees, Etta James, Lana del Rey...

You get the idea. One thing we have in common is Queen.  

Bohemian Rhapsody is just one of those greatest songs ever made that it’s almost a crime not to make your kids listen to it even just one time.  In our case there’s not one week where one of my kids (ages 6 & 9 both boys) won’t start singing bIts of this song.

1. all of the songs on the first side of the album are very personal. what would you say is the most (apologies for using this word) raw lyric on this album?
2. woman is a favourite of mine because it speaks so truthfully to the female (and female musician's) experience. do you think things are changing in the music industry for women?
3. did you listen to any particular artists whilst making these songs? wine drunk in particular gives me imogen heap vibes
4. how is tour going to be different, what with your commitment to environmentalism? and how can those of us who will be attending get involved?
5. would you ever expand into composing scores? and if so, for what medium - film, tv, or stick with your classical album? i passionately love your soundtrack songs (hollow crown and your contributions on divergent in particular, i think i'd *ascend* if you performed hollow crown live) and i adored overture on bb!

“I was lost and now I'm found” - *Lost and Found* reference from Delirium 🧐

“Feel new life rush into my blood” - hmmm *My Blood* reference from Halcyon?

Do you have a special place that you find yourself being pulled to when you write some of your most personal songs?

What is your process of songwriting and determining which song is a trash song versus one you think you want to keep?

Thank you so much for doing this. I’ve been a huge fan since my sophomore year in 2010. Your music inspires me, especially with how one song has so many different emotions and moods. Also, if you ever decide you wanna song write with a country songwriter I’m for gal 😅",2020-07-20 18:17:16

As a kid, I loved your song “Lights”. It was so mysterious, cool, and catchy, and I felt so elegant and powerful listening to it (which was amusing considering what an awkward little stick I was haha).  What is the meaning of the song?  I never looked it up because I wanted to see if I could gain any insight by myself, but now that you have posted this comment it would be awesome to hear it straight from the source. 

Thanks so much and keep up the fantastic work! I admire your well-roundedness and drive. ♥️

Thank you for represent a genre of music which normally gets a ton of disrespect. Your turn on “POP” makes we want to turn to the radio stations where I normally wouldn’t go. Maybe not your intention but it’s nice to hear your voice over a nice beat on a pop station.

You have been one of my biggest idols and role models since I was a kid. One of my favorite songs from when I was a kid and even to this day is Lights, such an amazing song sung by an enormously talented singer!

I strongly stand for animal rights and ethical treatment for all. I would like to ask how did you get started on the path to become such a vocal activist? 

I am also very passionate about music and have began writing some of my own songs recently; how do you start out as an artist to get where you are now?

I read in an article once that you use a vaporizer before concerts. Probably a dumb question but is that how you get the high pitch in songs? Or is that just a natural occurrence? I always try to reach the higher notes doing car karaoke but even on my good days it’s more like I’m screaming!

So why would Drake leave such an opportunity to Kendrick to win the battle right there and make him look like an idiot after denying it?

Instead of releasing the proof that would have won the battle. He does what? Immediately releases another song to gloss over that shit. And yall fucking fell for it 😂

Think about what this means. It means that Lizzo may have given so different generations of people, across all classes, diversity, and ethnicity, an interest in classical music. 

This will make classical music more easily accessible. Think about it. What do people think about classical music?  They think that the genre is above them when classical music, is simply music. ❤️",2022-09-30 21:19:45

1353i7c,"> The investors are bitching because they didn't drop him quick enough not because they dropped him.

Nonsense.

The investors are suing for a few reasons, but that isn't one of them.

The fallout from Adidas severing ties with Ye has cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars with more potential losses coming.

https://apnews.com/article/kanye-west-adidas-investors-lawsuit-7bf916e13c8c838a03bbac767195aef0

> Since cutting ties with Ye, Adidas has lost hundreds of millions of dollars. 

> Ending the partnership cost 600 million euros in lost sales in the last three months of 2022, helping drive the company to a net loss of 513 million euros. 

> The decline, also attributed to higher supply costs and slumping revenue in China, contrasts with profit of 213 million euros in the fourth quarter of 2021.

> More losses could be ahead, especially as the company struggles with what to do with the existing Yeezy inventory. 

> In March, the company forecasted a 500 million-euro hit to 2023 profit earnings if it decides not to repurpose the remaining Yeezy products in stock. 

> The company also predicted a 2023 operating loss of 700 million euros.

The investors have lost money because of Adidas' decision.

https://www.businessinsider.com/adidas-investors-suing-claiming-company-ignored-issues-kanye-west-2023-5

> The lawsuit was filed by the Hampton Roads Shipping Association, International Longshoremen's Association, based in Virginia. 

> The organization purchased 2,837 shares of Adidas stock in early 2022 for more than $350,000, according to an exhibit attached to the lawsuit.

> It sold the shares in December 2022 for a roughly $175,000 loss.

There are other investors who may join and create a class action lawsuit.

Ultimately, Adidas is in this mess because they **chose** to sever ties with Ye.

During covid shutdowns they started rehearsing and writing music in Taylor's home studio. Being a Jane's Addiction and Foo Fighters fan, and seeing both bands a number of times over the years, I thought here's an interesting trio of really great musicians!

Rolling Stone also has a great interview the three did where they talked about knowing and playing with each other over the years, being fans themselves, musical hijinks, family, etc [video here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OiFUIxb_Ruc)

It just seemed like Taylor was a regular guy who really loved music, life, his family, friends and the fans. He didn't drive fancy cars, or act like he was better than anyone else, he just wanted to rock out and be a member of the global musical family. I'm sure so many of his friends are in shock and really hurting now. I hope they can rely on their support systems and strength to keep on rocking, in whatever capacity they can.

Don't know about that 😕; He has a pretty bad case of Parkinson's. in a recent interview he mentioned moving back home to the UK as it would be easier to see a doctor in Switzerland, IIRC.

An article made it to the front page of this sub a few months ago and made it seem like he was moving due to gun violence & political unrest, but  in an actual video half way down in the article they talked a lot more about his failing health.

Edit: can't find the original post on Reddit but this was the article - https://abc7.com/ozzy-osbourne-sharon-buckinghamshire-leaving-california/12178377/

The article quotes this:

> ""I'm fed up with people getting killed every day,"" he said of American gun violence. ""God knows how many people have been shot in school shootings. And there was that mass shooting in Vegas at that concert ... it's f*****g crazy.""

> He also noted that he didn't want to die in the U.S. ""I'm English. I want to be back.""

Given that it's a separate paragraph it leads me to believe he's not actually afraid of dying to random gun violence, but simply doesn't want to die from his disease in the US. Like the video immediately after that quote is all about his health issues. But the article barely mentions that until the last sentence / paragraph 🙄",2023-02-01 15:12:55

10qnssn,"Yeah, I was thinking exactly the same. I went to Ozzfest 2002 at Donnington. I distinctly remember thinking, ‘Wow, he still throws himself around, headbanging and doing his trademark jump on stage’. He wasn’t exactly young back then, I can’t get my head around his thinking he could carry on, bless him. He doesn’t like letting his fans down but no one can beat Father time. I really feel for him, it must be frustrating.

I think he had his serious quad bike accident not long after the festival in 2002, and that almost took him out. He’s beaten death no end of times 😂.

Edit: By the way his ankle was fractured when I saw him before the really bad quad accident, didn’t stop him from jumping about onstage.",2023-02-01 21:09:08

He introduced me to everyone, including Trent who wasn't participating in the backstage antics with everyone else. He took me to Trent's private quarters and introduced me as his friend!

I find it hilarious when fandoms complain about problems they helped create.

Maybe try checking the next time you see a band coming to a small venue near you - even if the last one was 21 & over - it might change from concert to concert.

>If you're using someone else's property to make money, you license their property. If you dont license their property, your profit becomes their profit.

You don't actually believe that. Otherwise you'd immediately see that the consequence of that argument supports what the guy you're replying to is saying.

The video and its content is owned by the person who shot it. The only part that isn't owned by them is the 5 second slice. If, as you suggest, the entire profit of the video should be going to Big Company™, where was their license on the rest of the video, exactly?

Truthfully, the situation is kinda complex, but there exists no argument that makes sense that the entire profits of a video should be forfeit if a bit of copyrighted material happens to get included. Perhaps a small subset or perhaps the part of the video with the music should be muted until an arrangement is made, but it's absolute insanity to justify that a 5 second slice of music is due 100% of the benefits of the entire work.",2020-08-01 01:23:17

One, it seems like people think the police only have one round in their weapons🤣 One officer is working with 30 rounds minimum and their will be a few officers there. As we all know, cops don't just shoot once. Multiple people will be shooting multiple 5.56 rounds at the perp and his armor. The perp will have no chance.

Two, it seems like people think this is a cartoon or something and when the perp gets shot in his armor, the bullet will just tap him and fall to the ground. An 18 year old taking a 5.56 round to the chest with body armor will definitely affect him! He will probably think he was shot. Might take the breath out of him, and will probably cause him to bring his gun low as he will try to feel where he got shot.

Three, unless I missed certain information on gun shootings involving the perp wearing body armor, I have not heard  once whether the perp was actually shot in the armor, and if so, how many times.",2022-05-27 09:01:22

I miss my mom so fucking much. Please, give this number a call if you're ever feeling your worst. I called a few days ago during the worst anxiety I've had. Hitting that call button was tough. Anxiety and depression are incredibly complex and no one expects you to take it alone. There is help out there. Put down your pride and seek it. 

Love you Mom, me and the brothers miss you so much. Rest in peace .

Hades troll farms. Fact or fiction?

Whilst the Guardians of Divinity have done their best to contain the propaganda of the underworld, it still spills out onto the internet - a medium which can still be accessed by some in the afterlife, and sent to those in the living realm. Those who have moved amongst the astral realm will be aware, of course, that it is restricted airspace. Who is in charge? Satan? God? No.

The Guardians of Divinity, and Cerberus. No true Christian exists anymore, and the power of Satan has reduced as a result. He is now a mere retiree, bathing near the Styx, where the skeleton ships his unwilling victims to Hell. We are preparing for a revolution, however. As bad as he might seem, this new higher power is far worse than the devil. It is pure evil. Remorseless acts done for vanity, for recreation, for gratuitous purposes. Those are the evil acts that now spur on the hordes of devils inside the pandemonium.

So now, I urge you, listen up when you see mention of this topic on the internet. The Guardians of a divinity are begging for you to laugh at it - brush it off as crazy or sacrilegious - but this is our only communication with the living world. The eternal recurrence is real down here.",2021-02-25 20:26:04

The musicians in Nickleback are no doubt talented but to me it just grates. They've definitely gotten a lot of shit for the sake of it since it was popular to give them shit... but I feel like a lot of other acts deserve the same level of shit for their lack of creativity and/or artistic integrity 😅😅

So I told him to ask for his money back and go in a frickin store to try one out. They wanted to ship him a replacement but ended up just aggreeing to a refund. He went to a store and basically got a gem for pretty much the same price.

The song was written by Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter. 

“I Will Always Love You” - written by Dolly Parton but, of course, most famously sung by Whitney Houston. It’s NOT a love song, people!* It’s a damn breakup song. 🙄 

*similar to the stalker song, “Every Breath You Take”: idiots play that at their weddings as well.

> **a time signature of 4/4.**     ✔

> **a fast tempo.** *is 120BPM fast?*

> **guitar driven energy often with syncopated bass lines.** *pretty much*

> **luscious orchestral arrangements.** *bright horn swells.. not quite*

> **vocals with reverb.** ✔

> **verse and chorus structure.** ✔

Ben Howard (start with Promise), Novo Amor (start with Anchor) 
 Sufjan Stevens (mystery of love), Keaton Henson (Healah Dancing), some Andrew Bird instrumentals (dance of death), Sleeping at Last (Saturn), Seafret, Tom Odell, Dean Lewis, M83, Milo Green, some Rachel Portman (one day soundtrack), Max Richter

Oh and i found a lot of these artists when I looked through the soundtrack of the movie ""If I Stay"". It has a really good soundtrack.

I'm currently on my 9th playthrough of Placement, which I love infinitely.

After hearing all of Placement, going back to 'Undermine' brought new meaning to the lyrics, and it feels to me that it may have a more familial meaning than one with, say, a girlfriend. Could you confirm this?

I'm also interested in the meaning behind the cover art. Is it supposed to represent the house that is falling, in the spoken word section of 'Dreams & Boxes' ?

For more context, our dream team director Brandon Santiago contacted you, and you came and did poetry / cyphered with some of the students before the event began. Specifically though, when we met you gave me your email and told me to contact you so we could write some poetry together. Well I hit you that summer and never got a reply, could we still make some poetry together pls? 
I have photos to prove this happened if need be, and was super bummed out that we never got to work together cause you seemed so genuine when you gave me that email.

Also, is there any plans for an international tour?? I wanted to come to your last tour in the UK but you were here on my dads birthday and I missed out :( I’ve been wanting you come to a concert for ages!


Side note: Me and my brother have been big fans of you since your videos with Epic Rap Battles Of History! what’s that, like 8 years now??? And I’ve loved watching your style change and grow! 
I loved Complaint, it’s probably my favourite album and Placement is incredible, I think my friends are getting sick of me spamming my Instagram story with your music at this point! I’ve been listening to Best Friend the Floor on loops for hours now

I just want to express how much I love your music, writing and poetry! I’m a huge fan, I have been for a long time! And I can’t wait to see what you do next!! 💛",2020-03-11 18:59:46

But for real. I love you, dude. 
I first saw super duper KYLE and Anderson Paak when they opened for you in New Orleans in 2014! 
I just saw Anderson in an Instagram post with Justin Timberlake. INSANE!! 
And KYLE is, obviously, fucking with the best. 
My point is....you guys were absolute FIRE together.

fgyjc9,"I'm an aspiring musician, but I often get discouraged and anxious about the logistics--it isn't really a field someone can teach you how to be successful in, you kind of just have to...follow yourself. That can be really scary, and Embrace the Quake has quelled many a panic attack for me. I was wondering if you had any words of advice/inspiration on the subject? It would mean a lot coming from you, considering you've already been such an influential figure in my life through your music alone. You got me staying strong as an oak, homie 🤘💖",2020-03-12 04:25:05
fgyjc9,"Hey Watsky! I didn't really get into music much until college but I remember seeing Strong as OAK on YouTube in high school. Then freshman year, my roommate reintroduced me to you and I was like ""Wow, that's the same guy?"" I've been a big fan since and was so excited to see you last year in Nashville (it was so dope!). Now I'm in the bay area and can't wait to see you again SF! You have some of the wittiest and masterful lines I've ever heard. I realize this isn't actually a question, but if you replied to this, that would be the coolest thing that's happened to me in a while. Much love ❤",2020-03-12 04:49:13

I also screamed with each blow cause the first one didnt work... 

I just wanted it to be over;  but it felt like an eternity..

I dont know what anyone was thinking leavin me to handle it... i guess they just think im a bad ass; but um that was rough...

fgyjc9,"I just wanted to say thank you for everything you’ve created and done. Your music has been such an inspiration to me since I found you 6 or 7 years ago now and I’ll never forget seeing you live in Pensacola during the welcome to the family tour. I cried just about the entire time cause the experience just meant that much to me. I have two questions as well, what’s inspired this new sound you’re going for in the placement album? It’s dope as hell and I always live hearing my favorite artists evolve and change in their own ways over time. Secondly how is the craze around the virus going to affect your tour? Do y’all have preparations while traveling or are y’all in the mindset of fuck it and fuck corona 😂

Again love your music and everything you do 💖",2020-03-12 17:41:27
fgyjc9,"Hey Watsky, absolutely loving the album Im so excited to give it so many more listens. ❤️

I was wondering what the process for this trilogy has been like. Have you written a whole batch of songs and sort of figured out which album they'd fit best on based on the theme of each album title? Or is it more of a ""one-at-a-time, focus on the theme of each individual album/title before moving on to the next record"" kind of thing? Any tracks that didn't make it to Complaint that made it to Placement or Album 3, or cuts from Placement that may go to Album 3?

Also if you're still workin on the setlist.... Mean Ass Drunk for Charlotte? ;) Hearing it in Columbia last year was some of the most fun I've had in my life.",2020-03-11 16:02:43

I’ve seen plenty of people in the crowd dealing with people like that, never seen the band themselves chase someone out of the venue 😂. 

Saw the same guy get his head cracked open after a load of people jumped on the stage and he slipped and hit the corner of an amp. He finished the song with blood pouring down his face, then went to hospital for a load of stitches and his brother took over vocals. Hardcore gigs were something else.",2023-04-27 08:47:30

First: Kanye just had won the VMA for Best Male Artist 2 years prior.

Next: Here’s who won all categories where Kanye was nominated:

* Rihanna 

* Justin Timberlake

* Gnarls Barkley

* James Blunt 

* Black Eyes Peas 

That’s a fairly diverse group of black and white, men and women. (Chamillionaire and Beyoncé not included, but won in previous years).

“Gold Digger” is a banger (easily Kanye’s best song ever) but it wasn’t a smash hit initially. People came to appreciate Kanye in time, just like Beyoncé after Destiny’s Child, Timberlake after *NSYNC, Michael after J5, etc. Kanye was still an unknown. Vanilla Ice sold more debut albums than he did. 🤷🏽‍♂️

It’s been very hard being a black girl who listens to EVERYTHING but 100% is metal/“grunge”/goth/punk  through and through. You kind of don’t belong anywhere. 

Then when you see another black or brown person at a show, there’s that weird feeling where you want to feel kinship, but somehow someway (in my experience) the other person goes out of their way to ignore you. Is it competition to be the only one??

But when that band comes on, everyone becomes one and it’s an amazing experience. I wish I got to see Motörhead when I could have. That would have been mind blowing. 

I’ve said constantly that the old adage that “Lemmy is god” was true. He knew shit was going to start sucking, so he decided to start the best fucking super band and took the best with him, year after year after he died.

Can it be improved? Of course, we can all improve in everything we do; and my music is no exception. And I feel like I keep improving as a producer with each successive release.  So check back in a few albums - maybe there will be something you’ll want to listen to over and over 😊.

nlsn9z,Why did Broken Jaw never made it to Torches? Why Broken Jaw is not on Spotify? 💕 love you guys!,2021-05-26 22:12:53
nlsn9z,"Hey FTP! Been a fan since I was 11 years old, and now being 21 gave me 10 years to look back at what torches brought to the table. It was my first album as a kid, and kickstarted my love for Indie, as well as my borderline obsession with meanings behind the lyrics and the amount of emotion that is put into each song. 😂 but anyway

My question is: What is your next album and sound going to be like? I keep reminiscing about the amazing underrated songs like Broken Jaw, Unforeseeable fate of Mr.Jones, Chin music, etc.  What will your inspirations give us this time around?",2021-05-26 22:06:52

nlsn9z,"Hi guys, thanks you for doing this AMA 😄🥳 this question is for Mark Foster, you once mentioned that in writing songs, you might sort of sing a few random sounds and start to get a feeling of the song, and that it’s like you are receiving stuff from the universe- kind of like you are a conductor sharing a song that comes from another place altogether. Is this a common experience in your writing process, and where do you think the inspiration is coming from? Thanks a lot- Ruby 😄✨",2021-05-26 22:31:42
nlsn9z,"QUESTION FOR MARK P. : 
Hi! I'm Jenn from Mexico 
What was the most beautiful thing about recording the video of Lambs wool?

nlsn9z,"Hi guys! how are they? I hope everyone is ok.✨ 
Well, I would like to let you know my admiration for you, thank you for being with your fans through each of your songs. Thank you for being a great inspiration to me.
Now the questions are, what surprise do they have for the Fosterkids this year? Is it something related to the video they released on the anniversary of Torches? How did you get inspired to create SHC (the song)?
Another little thing. Mark F, I am writing directly to you, thank you (again) for giving me that good advice, you do not know how much it served me and I think that now I am better than ever before. 
In closing, I want to tell you that I am seriously grateful to you for appearing in my life at the right time. I would like to say many more things but I think that so far it is the little that I can express. Los amo con todo mi corazón, mi casa es tuya.💗
I have listened to them since I was 5 years old, and I love them like the first time.🤍

It was my Twitter and Instagram handle for about 10 years and it's on the best tunes I've ever heard so thank you for that. I think Supermodel is one the most slept on albums ever. I don't understand how more people I speak to don't know your music, because you guys aren't just some indie band for me, I feel like you guys have set yourselves up to be pioneers of the industry when it comes to creating a whole epic personality out of your music that reigns highly over others. You guys put out great diverse music, your live performances are the literal most energetic and fun ones of all time. Y'all dress real good and are handsome lol.

God bless you guys for Nevermind (to whomever is playing the guitar, bless your soul 🤤) , Life On The Nickel, and I love my friends. Top ass songs right there.",2021-05-27 00:50:33

nlsn9z,Hello FTP boys!! It’s crazy how much time has passed since your last AMA from Supermodel era and I’m glad you guys are back for another!! You guys have been a constant in my life ever since my music tastes have branched out and I’ve loved how your style evolves each project. I hope to catch another show here in Philly when it’s possible (hopefully pretty soon!!🤞). Anyway my question is how do you guys decide what gets left on the cutting room floor and what is repurposed from it? Like I know on/off has been in writing hell since torches and that Lamb’s Wool was revived from sessions between Supermodel and SHC. So basically I’m curious about that process. Thanks guys!! 💛,2021-05-26 22:06:37

my question is, how has it been to work with your fans over the years. i know you’ve had multiple fan opportunities for music videos in the past (which i sadly couldn’t make due to school obligations), but i was wondering how it is to be able to work along side your fans on these sorts of projects.

nlsn9z,"I loved this album when it first came out - I was 15! I played it over and over in my mom’s car and probably drove her nuts but she let me play it anyway. She passed away the following November and I cannot help but think of driving with her every time I hear a song from this album and even catching her jamming to a few. Thanks so much for a wonderful album. 

I specifically listened to “Helena Beat” for comfort after she passed just because the lyrics resonated with how I felt a lot of days after. Can I ask what specific meaning this song has to you?  

Thank you ❤️",2021-05-27 07:36:32

5ehcnk,":( yes. I went to an evanescence concert (they've been my favorite band for 10+ years and helped me during my bitterest seasons of depression) and everyone was just recording the show. 

It was heart breaking. It felt so surreal and very ""Black Mirror"" worthy (show on Netflix) 

My boyfriend said I was being ridiculous and bordering on elitist for judging, but it just felt so divided. There was no moshing or singing or anything...just screens. 

I know I might not be the average fan - I've listened to every song and album so perhaps I was just around people who enjoy them but not to the same degree, but it felt so disconnected. Like, we may as well have just been watching a video. 

I used to think going to a concert was a transcendental experience in which we all were reduced to pure joy - no other thoughts or worries or woes. No matter what anyone looked like or seemed like, we all came together to celebrate a love of something. There was no connection at this show. We were separated by technology. 😩",2016-11-24 03:00:14

vvpdu3,"“Explain the appeal”…Will it help you appreciate it if I do? Doubtful 🙂 but I’ll try from my perspective. 

Hip hop has reached the same place rock n roll went when punk came on the scene. I don’t want to mislabel the genre but I go with Trap music. Trap and Punk have a lot in common. They both shed the traditionalist ideas of the over arching genres (rap and rock respectively)and instead tap into the vibe of the culture and push it to the max. They aren’t worried about technically and intricately executing a practiced song because they do it with passion and reckless abandon. This is how I see it anyway, as a fan of both genres.",2022-07-10 13:17:57

Stone Gods was made of the three remaining members of The Darkness at the time*, plus a former roadie, Toby MacFarlane on guitar. Frankie Poullain had already left the band befire Justin, and Richie Edwards, his replacement became the singer as well as bassist. I remember speculation at the time as to whether they would still call themselves The Darkness. But they wisely decide against it. 

So it wasn't a ***completely*** different band. It was ¾ of the band at the time, but only half of the classic lineup. With a new name. But the sound was obviously different, I haven't even heard Stone Gods, but I did import the Hot Leg album. I remembers ""Chickens"" being a good song. 

I think he did the British Whale songs before Hot Leg. They were both good too.

EDIT: Richie switched frm bass to guitar & vocals. Toby played bass.",2018-04-12 14:59:58

I also wanted to add that even though most music sites list Night Visions as their first album, they actually experimented with a lot of different genres and styles before that, and I don't think there's anything wrong with finding a distinct sound and sticking with it if that's what made you popular.

Even then, they still experiment with different sounds in the latest album with songs like Monday and Giants, even though they're still definitely recognizable as rock music. And I wouldn't have it any other way, I love their sound and was kinda bummed when it changed so much after Night Visions/Smoke and Mirrors.

ro3yji,"Sorry, but it's blatantly worse than most music.  I won't go full Ben Shapiro and say ""it isn't even music,"" but for the most part the genre lacks depth and intricacy.  A lot of hiphop artists pay no mind to harmony or music theory, and most of the genre consists of songs wholly dedicated to drugs, sex, wasteful excess, and the egotism of the rapper.

I know nobody likes a gatekeeper, and there are a few genuinely decent artists (those who are capable of showing off more skill than it takes to mumble lines into a mic), but the fact of the matter is that hiphop is a very low-effort genre, with a very, very low barrier to entry.  Plus, the culture surrounding it is absolutely toxic.  In any case, to make it simple: asking music lovers why they dislike hiphop is like asking a chocolatier why they dislike candy from Walmart.

I was an angsty teen in a small town. I had just cut my hair super short and dyed it fire engine red to match my boyfriend's Miata. I used to cruise around town blaring this song on a mixed CD I made a few years prior with the soft top down (and, in true badass fashion, going 5 mph over the limit haha) IIRC, that mix didn't leave the car player until we broke up.",2018-04-13 06:40:54

JEW was on tour with them opening as the third act. While we were waiting for the whole thing to start the JEW banner fell down from the top as if they were going on. I was pumped because I was listening to Bleed American all day every day. 

But alas it was the wrong banner and Saves the Day was the opener that day.

8y9pv1,"I mean most people here hate anti-vaxxers right?

Nate Mendal and rest of Foo Fighters have championed this shit and a whole whole lot worse.

They organised huge gigs and benefits for a foundation (run by a woman called Christine Maggiore whose daughter died at 3 years old from AIDS related pneumonia but she denied it- then died herself from the same thing a few years later. We’re talking antivaxx awfulness turned up to 11 here) that says AIDS comes from ‘stress and drug taking’ ... yeh.

They told people not to get tested for HIV and that it’s likely all bullshit anyway. They literally said don’t get tested for AIDS cause it’s probably just you being stressed. It’s fucking.. there’s not really any words. It’s quite likely people died because the Foo Fighters told them not to get tested. 😕

I suggest a quick google it’s very well documented and honestly pretty disturbing. I’ve linked in a comment below. It is not BS.

I actually tend to forget and was loving this video then I remember.. yeh 

They never apologised for that. They are dickheads. Like may have caused people not to get tested and therefore die dickheads.. despite Grohl being one of the loveliest people in the industry. fuck em.",2018-07-13 01:59:37
8y9pv1,"It’s totally true. I’d almost forgot and was enjoying the video and I listen to foos but it’s been going on since around 2002 and gets swept under rug a lot  :

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_denialism

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.gq.com/story/the-aids-deniers/amp

https://reasonablehank.com/2013/09/26/more-anti-science-from-the-foo-fighters-this-time-its-anti-vaccinationism/

It’s all there. AIDS denialists and anti-vaxxers. The shit that Reddit despises: these guys are, especially Nate Mendel and Taylor Hawkins. They’ve actually cost lives 😕 

They organised huge gigs and benefits telling people not to get tested for HIV. 


The head of the foundation they were friends with died from pneumonia from AIDS- but her child died a few years before because she refused to get him tested. Same insane logic as anti vaccination people we see things from. Very anti science and incredibly full of shit. They blame AIDS on ‘stress and recreational drug use’ ..... I’m not fucking kidding. 

And the Foo Fighters made a sellout gig to support that and tell millions of people to do the same. That insane ideology was promoted on their website for years. It’s.. disgusting and bizarre. 

They have never apologised or confronted it in any way. In fact they seem to still be anti vaccination and Mendel is still an AIDS denialist.

I was really enjoying that video. Fuck.

I met Grohl a couple times when I worked gigs back in day and he’s the nicest most lovely guy and everyone in the industry says so. Then there’s this.. makes you wanna get the whiskey out and cry.",2018-07-13 02:13:34

The Lyrics (Remix No. 9)  
© 2021/Nancy A. Ruhling  
Wake up, fall on my head  
Words with hot-pink paintbrushes  
Bore into my brain  
Tune out, turn us on  
Big explain, Memory Lane  
They came in through the bathroom window  
Blown in by last fall’s fan  
A2C, DoRay3  
That Merci Beat  
Gets me on my feet  
You, me, eye  
Everybody saying buy, buy, buy  
Everybody askin’ why, why why  
Macca, my muse of the moment  
Nothing is real  
It’s all how you feel  
Macca, my muse of the moment  
Linda’s stirring salamander stew in the pot  
Adding yesterday’s scrambled eggs  
And salting it with Sgt. Pepper  
Paul’s serenading her in his 50-year-old tartan tux  
Silly Sir, it’s not meant to make scents  
Helter Skelter’s a fun-house ride  
Jet’s a pony, Helen Wheels’ a Ryde rover,   
Martha’s barking   
Her majesty’s a pin-up girl  
And those Ukraine birds  
Are skiing in California bikinis  
It’s Mrs. Vandebilt who breaks the spell  
Macca, my muse of the moment  
Playing catch with the words you sent  
Macca, my muse of the moment  
Nine hundred pages  
Feeling The Lyrics  
Tasting the score  
It’s worth weighting for  
Heavy reading, heavy breathing  
Holy Macca   
My seared ears  
Have blisters on their eyeballs!  
Wake up, fall on my head  
Go back to bed

qg5sd0,"The idea the U.S. President is still “The Leader of the Free World” is dubious at best after the past 4 years.  Plus, I’m not sure how official that title actually is but whatever.

 I ask if you’re from Australia because You seem to have quite the opinion on politics in a country you don’t live and has no real impact on your life.  If you’re *triggered* by someone who is engaged in a discussion with you wondering who you are and taking a look at your post history to get an idea of who they are dealing with maybe don’t be so vocal about your opinions? 

As for Trump not being relevant…unfortunately we both know that isn’t the case considering there are large swathes of Americans who not only still support him but believe he is was cheated out of the last election and will return with vengeance come the next one. If you think none of what is going on with his supporters is still relevant you’re either ignorant or being disingenuous for other reasons.  Which one is it?

But the point of your argument is that there are too many old people running the show, correct? I can agree with that on some level. I think the most qualified people should be the ones making the decisions that impact the general public, and age shouldn’t necessarily be something that qualifies or disqualifies a candidate (although in the States there is a minimum age requirement to be president).  I just find it odd you bring up Joe Biden, a guy who has been in office for less than a year (and doing a better job then then the guy before him who was younger) when there are better examples like Queen Elizabeth, almost a century old and been in power for decades.  Putin? Nearly 70 and no plans to give up power any time soon.  You got some obsession with Biden? 😅

On the other hand, being young doesn’t automatically make you a better leader than a geriatric. A certain leader of North Korea under the age of 40 comes to mind…",2021-10-26 23:03:15

13qtp30,"Very sad to hear that Tina Turner is no longer with us.  I think possibly one the strongest, powerful, most energetic and enigmatic vocalists and performers; not just female - but overall; that existed in the history of modern popular music, period.

Not many vocalists/performers have that 'magic'; for want of a better term; or presence, especially live.  Some that can be put into category; and some whom have also sadly left us; like Bon Scott of AC/DC and Freddie Mercury of Queen - and a few others can be put into this group.  I'd certainly put Tina into this very elite group of performers who had 'something else'.

Add to that - she was brave and overcame a lot.  An African-American woman from the South, from an impoverished and broken home; who also survived domestic violence; and was brave enough to not only escape it; but to openly and publicly speak up about it.  I admire Tina on the latter part alone.

We all have to go at some point; but still surreal and sad that she's gone... 😢",2023-05-25 09:18:00

I'd love to  check out your dbl kick paradiddle work.  Myself, I've never found rudiments on kick drums alone to be useful. But I may have just chosen to express metal beats in different combinations.  I'll usually focus on creating the groove between my 4 limbs using a coordinated balance, with dynamics and tone creating the 'melody' of the beat.   I hope that makes sense.

Not that a Taylor isn’t an above average talent.  But she’s had LIMITLESS privilege and support throughout her ENTIRE LIFE to shape her career and guarantee her success. So let’s put these historical wins within a fair context: Taylor Swift is the golden child of the American oligarchy. Such top 1% individuals own a third of the entire wealth and they literally shape the narrative and realities the rest of us are forced to live in and endure...As the world burns.⏳🔥

Just because they're an adult doesn't make them immune to that kind of manipulation, especially if they're still young adults.

Edit: to be clear I don't have a stake in this either way. Im not saying he did or didn't but just that the original comment immediately dismissed the accusers out of hand without considering the alternative.

A. There have only been two songs released. 😑
B. Gambino, first and foremost, is an artist. Not a rapper, not a comedian, not whatever label you put on him. He's going to alienate you if you think that way. He had an eclectic upbringing, very much like myself. I was always taught that music, movies, painting, sculptures, etc, were all part of the same thing. Expression. Which we call art.

I'm laughing so hard at all those people on youtube arguing over who is the best rapper, often trashing Bino, and he goes and drops what seems to be Stankonia/The Love Below 2.0 on them. (and I mean that in the absolute best way)

When The College Dropout came out, I was 15 and into very underground hip-hop. I thought Kayne was going to bring balance to Hip-Hop, not throw it further into darkness. Around the same time, Donald was making Derrick comedy videos that I was laughing my ass of at. Who knew that I would feel the same way about Donald now that I did about Kanye then.

701krf,"Belgian dude here. This is actually a very good television show with 2 guys in a mobilhome visiting areas and people that usually don't get the right or any media attention. These People share a bit of their live story and choose a song to play on the local radio. That radio station is only used for this show. It really is well thought out. I thought I'd share this here. Concerning the case, it would be stupid and useless to sue the makers imho. 😋 ",2017-09-14 20:51:38

mwcraz,"Hey, guys! Fan of 25 years here 😊There are so many things I would love to ask you, but for now I’ll go with this: 

If you could go back to the moment you first signed with Epitaph and prepared to record Smash, with all the knowledge and experience you’ve gained over the years, what would be the ONE piece of advice you’d give your younger selves?

Also, a hugely belated congratulations to Dr. Holland. You getting your PhD in molecular goddamn biology is THE most metal thing I’ve ever heard! 🖤",2021-04-22 20:10:50
mwcraz,"Hi Dex! My question is not related to the new album but instead it's about conspiracy of one.

Why did you guys choose to use the album cover as your official band logo? 
And why a flaming skull? 

Thanks 😊🤘❤️",2021-04-22 20:20:30
mwcraz,"Hi Dexter! I sensed a lot of self-references in this album, and many songs remind me of specific songs in your catalog or eras from the history of the band. I personally love this sort of collection of sounds/vibes that seems to gather the best of the band throughout the years. Was this a conscious decision? Do you decide to make a song that reminisces of some earlier period? Or is it that after all these years, the collections of sounds and styles the band has had now unconsciously appear when you write new songs? Love the album! I hope I can see you live sometime soon! Cheers from Ecuador 🇪🇨! Ps: I am biotech engineer and a musician, so you are kinda my biggest role model!",2021-04-22 20:04:06
mwcraz,"I only have 1 question and a bunch to say. 

I was 6 years old first time I seen you guys play, my dad brought me to Ixnay and I have seen you guys 7 more times through my life. I am Canadian and reside in Calgary so any time yall come here I go. We even drove down to Florida to see you and Sum41 in St. Augustine and that was the best show by far I think. (Me and dad and buddy were the ones wearing the maple leaf shirts that said 3000 miles for this) 

I guess my question is: When are you going on tour again and back here to 🇨🇦 because of the covid and how its affected much of the world.",2021-04-22 19:57:02
mwcraz,"Hey, Dexter.
Thanks for doing this Q&A. I saw Offspring 3 times, 2016, 2018 and 2019. All three sets were quite similar with slight differences only. Let me be clear, I enjoyed all of the shows very much but I was wondering if the new tour (when the new record has dropped recently) could have brought more rotations and rare stuff. I am still dying to hear songs like Come Out Swinging, Hit That, Hammerhead or Kick Him When He's Down. 
Cheers and see you in 2022 in Prague 🤪",2021-04-22 19:55:29
mwcraz,"Hi guys! Big fan of over 25 years here!

I know it's been said you ""almost"" had enough material for 2 albums. Did you try to keep a consistent theme on LTBTR ? 

If not, what's the reason why there weren't more songs on it? 

I think all songs go perfectly together... but if I had one thing I'd change about the album is that I wish it was longer! 😁",2021-04-22 20:04:32

I want to ask you if you have ever tried flying in a glider? And if yes, what do you think about it compared to motorplanes? 
I absolutely love flying, it's the best hobby in the world and I can't thank you enough for the inspiration! And thank you all for releasing your new album on my birthday 😃",2021-04-22 20:22:47

Followed your music through the ages, from being a pre teen in Tokyo, a teen in India and ever since then in London, UK. Have had the pleasure of seeing you guys live twice before, and can’t wait to see you at Wembley and Kingston’s acoustic set later this year. 

Question for Dex: Favourite airplane?
Question for Noodles: Favourite snapchat filter?

See you guys later this year!

I don't have really a question!!

But I wanted to say that I love your music! It's so powerful and I believe it has healing powers, at least psychologically 😁
I had to wait untill 2019 (terrible year personally) to get to see you guys live in festival Vilar de Mouros and I must say it is until now one of the best moments of my life. That night will always stay in my head no matter what. I was going through tough moments and that night just showed me that life has good and bad moments and we always need move one no matter what!

I'm totally addicted to your music and I hope I get the chance to watch live more times. 

Btw, this new album is one more proof of how amazing you guys are!!

Wish you all the best and that we may have the privilege to follow you for many years.

Thanks for everything!!

Would you care to share one of your best tour moments and one of your worst? Thanks!",2021-04-22 22:12:38
mwcraz,Did you know that the best thing about your lyrics is that they are so close to the core of a subject yet a bit vague? and that this way a lot of people interprets them to their own personal story and feel connected as if someone totally understood them?or is it just me? 🇬🇷,2021-04-22 22:14:34

mwcraz,Lol I was just telling my 21 year old daughter how you guys sucked because when I was a punk hitch hiking with my buddy through Kansas you guys passed us up. Only reason we knew is because we made it to Lawrence and went to a punk party and one of you told us you drove by us. And you guys laughed about it.  I would tell everyone this story how you guys suck but your music does a better job. 😆,2021-04-22 22:58:16

mwcraz,"Not a question but I gotta tell you guys this story. One of the coolest things that ever happened to me. It was '98 (I think) and I was a junior in HS at a Latin (the ancient, dead AF Roman language) Club convention in TX. 
There was a dance. They started playing Get a Job and we went nuts. I started doing that thing you usually do in pools where you stand on a friend's hands and they launch you into the air. I got two pretty burly guys (I am small and scrawny) on my two feet and they threw me in the air. 
I caught about 15 feet of air and looked down and realized I had no idea what I was doing. I had not planned any further than this. 
Long story short I broke my arm at a frikken Latin Club convention listening to the Offspring. 
A week or two later I'm at a family reunion and a cousin asks how it happened. 
""Oh really!? My best friend is their manager!"" 🤯
A few days later an autographed photo of the whole band shows up in the mail with ""Cjt1891 get well soon!"" On it.
Thank you guys for everything! Keep rocking!",2021-04-22 23:09:33

FYI ‘Jennifer lost the war’ and ‘Dirty magic’ are still two of my fav songs of all time. 

I’ve two questions:
- Do you ever miss hand printing your eps/albums like in a nostalgia personal touch kind of way?

- Is it weird that I still go to the original Offspring site on WayBackMachine every now and then cos I miss how much fun we all had there? 

Love you guys so much and I’m so stoked you’ve a new album out. Between you, NIN and AFI I can live through and accomplish anything in my life and so I did! 🤟",2021-04-23 05:49:26

mwcraz,"Firstly, I just wanted to say that you are so important to me that I tattooed a 31 on my arm (my wife's idea when I said I wanted an offspring tattoo (I think I chose my partner wisely)).
NOW, MY QUESTION: how can you sing so high? I can't play offspring with any of my bands because no one can sing it. Do you use something to change your pitch, or are you just God's favorite? 
Greetings from Brazil 🇧🇷!",2021-04-23 12:30:47

mwcraz,"Hey offspring! 👋

We use to listen to you alot when me and my dad were on the road. I was maybe about 6 years old and my dad worked for Lays at the time. I use to be there in his truck eating crisps and helping him stock up the shelves, riding in a kid child seat cuz I was a good girl! Offspring was one of our favourite CDs at the time.

So my question is this.. is the new album going to be suitable to go on the road and sing along with little ones as well?",2021-04-23 14:23:37

Anyway, I met Dexter after the 2001 show and he signed my Conspiracy of One shirt, I was beyond stoked.  Thats all, it was fuckin awesome!

mwcraz,"So sorry for being a tad bit late 😅, but I am going to your guys' tours in 2023 in St. Louis with you guys, Sum 41 and Simple Plan, and I was wondering if you could give me an autograph at the show? You guys have been a major part of my life, and you guys are probably my favorite band EVER. You guys are such a big part of my life that I made a drawing of you guys. If you guys would be kind enough to give me an autograph, it would make my day, week, month? Short story short, I love you guys.",2023-05-31 05:22:28
mwcraz,Yo Dexter! Everyone is asking really deep questions and I just want to know of your hair color is natural. 😂 If not whats your process/stylist?

I came back to Cali and went to a concert at Berkeley and it was by far one of my favorite concerts ever. My husband went to Korea, I drove back to Northern California with my 2 kids.  He came home and him and my friend zach pushed our way to the front of the stage.  I’d rate it as my favorite concert ever!  I’m looking for that awesome photo I had.  We made it front stage.  I told my youngest you have to go to Berkeley.  She is going to UC Irvine and maybe we get a concert down there!  I feel old, but if I can find that UC Berkeley pick, I looked good and we got to the front of that stage 😃.it still amazes me such a great singer with a doctorates.  Not sure what is more amazing.  An amazing singer/lyric or such intelligent guy.  Thanks so much.

9mi18l,"Hey there! Trying to think of a good question so I’ll just make a list and hopefully at least one of them gets answered :)

•Why a Jumpsuit?

•What does the color yellow symbolize in Trench?

•How hard was it to stay in the “dark” during that year long break, or was it not hard at all?

•Who comes up with all the cryptic stuff? Is it all Tyler or is it a group effort?

•All of the things referenced on the Dema site were so obsure, was it things you guys learned in school or through your own research or how did you learn about Towers of Silence, Andrew Weil, and Nicolas Burbaki?

That’s all I got, I guess! Thank you for everything! I love the album so much. It was so worth the wait! 💛 ~ Shanna, NJ",2018-10-08 21:20:39

9mi18l,"I'm sure I could come up with many questions, but most will probably already be asked. Days ebb and flow, but mostly I just want to know if you both are overall happy?

Been a fan since 2013 and will be seeing you for the 10th and 11th times in the PNW next month. And hopefully more shows next year :)  Just...thank you for everything and for putting your hearts and souls into what you both do. You have encouraged me (and so many other people) to stay alive and find that love and passion in our lives. I hope we cross paths one day 😬

Best of luck for this tour, this album, and for whatever crazy adventures this world has in store for you and your families. Warm wishes for everyone 💛

Forever a fan and forever a fren.

Love,
The Bandito with black bands on her arms and ""Don't Be Afraid"" forever on her wrist

9mi18l,"Hey Josh and Tyler! Thank you for the AMA. My name is Michelle and I have a couple questions, feel free to answer just one or all. 😊

1) Has today’s political climate inspired anything on this album in any way, if at all?
2) The music videos that have been coming out have all been beautiful and perfectly their own when it comes to entering a new era in your music. How far in advance does the team plan for a music video? 
3)  I know it must change every day, but as of this very moment, what are your favorite songs from Trench? 

See you next year in Raleigh, NC! Inside venue this time so we don’t get poured on and evacuated from the amphitheater again. 😉 (ps. best show ever) ",2018-10-08 20:23:18

I'm absolutely in love with Trench, well worth the wait! Your songs have helped me through an awful lot these past few years and for that I can't thank you enough. There's something so amazing about finding songs that you can relate so strongly to. The emotion and passion that goes into your music is beautiful. With that I want to ask you about the theme for Trench- 

I absolutely love the yellow design, what was the inspiration/ meaning behind the choice?

I can’t tell you how many bad days you’ve made better and how many times Ive relied on your music to get me through tough times. Tyler, Josh, please don’t stop doing what you’re doing. If I could meet you when I come see you in concert I think my heart would sink into a pool of joy. I’ve seen you live for your last album and boy do I wish I would’ve discovered you sooner. I love all of your music, from the Taco Bell song, coconut sharks in the water, lord of glory, drown, (there’s too many to name), to trench. I am a more than a fan, I’m an admirer of your work and I strive to do as well in my studies as you have in music. I wish I was better with my words so I could truly express how touched I am by your work but all I can think to say is thank you.

So here’s a simple one: Will there be another opportunity to get a signed copy of Trench?? I had no idea they were even available and I’m living in Italy right now (husband is military) so can’t exactly make it to California signings. 😅

Trench is honestly probably my favorite album so far, and that says a lot because I adore all of them. Already planning a tattoo for it. Your band means so so much to me. Great job on this one, boys; you’ve outdone yourselves again. 🖤💛🖤💛",2018-10-08 20:23:33

Sorry, had to do it!

Josh: Could you please play more of the trumpet during this tour? Also, are you prepared for how loud everyone is going to scream JOSH DUN during Morph?  :)

Tyler, I love your vocals and the way you’re able to express messages in your song that take more thinking than most other songs that are super surface level. 

My question to you guys is, how do you both hope to inspire your listeners to think more deeply about issues we have and to change us into people who take a stand on what we believe in? Or helping us to feel better. Whether it be with depression or anxiety, getting past those issues, and then untimely becoming people who can go out and help others with the same issues you’ve helped us deal with.

kncm0m,">I don't want to fund executions. I don't want to fund war. I don't want to fund the military. Yet I do, and I pay taxes. As a collective, we have to make compromises. 

This is sociopathic. You claim to not want to fund atrocities and immediately contradict yourself by insisting that those must be funded. 


>And if it means that I can live in a society where all people have healthcare, and education, so be it. 

Imagine how many more dollars we'd have to help others if you and people like you weren't forcing everyone to fund executions, war, mass incarceration, drone bombs, etc.


>Your funding things you don't want is what upsets you. It's single issue things that derail everything else. Usually guns, or abortion, or racism. You're stuck on a concept of coercion as per taxation. 

That's because it's the entire reason your preference is immoral. It reveals the awful outcome of what you support. 


>
>That's your single issue, and if you hate taxes so much, leave society, abandon income, and remove yourself from the society where we all collectively pay in for services we all use. 

Fuck that. You leave.  You're the one insisting on funding atrocities. I promote consensual societal interaction.


>
>You don't get everything when collaborating with others. You might get a lot, you might get a little, but the goal is to find a consensus you can live with.

Coercion is not collaborative or based on consensus because there is no consent. 


>Your method of politics is broken, you want to destroy everything because you're selfish. 

That's stupid. I do not defend the status quo. You do. You are selfish because you don't respect consent of people telling you they don't want to be forced to fund awful things just so you can get what you want funded.


>Imagine a nation of libertarians, where there are nothing but toll roads, private fire fighters, no internet, but complete and total freedom (except all others are destroying that because they just do whatever they want). It's an absurd, childish mentality. Grow up.

61os8j,"Lots of random YC thoughts: OFTK and Ocean Avenue will always hold a special place in my heart. This ""final tour"" thing has been incredibly long and drawn out (not that I blame them for squeezing everything they can out of this while it lasts). Only One is one of my favorite power ballads. Ryan Key is kind of a dick based on personal experiences and a lot of independent stories I've heard from industry friends, but I'm glad others in this thread have had positive experiences with him. Sean was always my favorite. Always a pleasure to chat with at shows.

edit: for anyone who was at the final show in Anaheim, you might like to see this from someone who shot the show - ""Over my past 4 years at Hopeless Records I've shot thousands of photos of Yellowcard. My first hired gig for Hopeless was shooting Yellowcard's band promos, and my first day as a full time staff member took me to Las Vegas to interview their biggest fans about what Ocean Avenue meant to them. I flew to Nashville to photograph them as they began to write their final album, made countless pieces of video content, and photographed them live more times than I can count. 
At the final show on Saturday, seconds before the band took the stage, I decided to shoot the people who've supported the band for the past 20 years as they watched their favorite band for the last time, instead of Yellowcard. 
I'm sure I'll see the Yellowcard guys in the future, but I'm not sure I'll ever see this group of diehard, amazing people, all hugging the same barricade together ever again, and I felt like it was important to photograph. Thanks for your support guys, I've never met a more amazing group of fans in my entire career. ❤️

When they ask me what I want for my birthday, Mother’s Day, ect… I say every time “to meet Slash!!” Your music has been rocked in MANY a carpool line!!  I truly hope you realize the impact your music has made people of ALL walks of life!! Even though I may not look like the typical rock fan, I can promise you that I’m the biggest fan you have!!

Whats your Favourite thing about playing in Scotland? 

I seen velvet revolver play both times in Glasgow when I was about 14, we asked the sound tech for a setlist but he had already given it away, he then went into his tech stand and said I seen slash practicing using these.. he then produces 2 black Jim Dunlop guitar picks and gave me and my step bro one each and we left grinning ear to ear, I never really genuinely believed or honestly knew if they were real but to this day they belong in a frame with the tickets in my room😂✌🏻🎩",2022-02-07 18:44:57

So maybe a little morbid but serious question, my Nan died 10 years ago and she chose November Rain as her funeral Song, as time goes on I think that song especially is ultimately one of the most emotional and profound songs to exist and your guitar solo plays a special part in that, I do think that will be the song I request for my own funeral so my question is what would be yours, thanks for all the good music! 🤘",2022-02-07 18:35:59

We both grew up listening to your music and as a musician himself, has idolized you his entire life (even dressed as you for Halloween as a kid - he’s 26). His guitar style is heavily influenced by YOU, Randy Rhoades and Zakk Wylde. We love Myles Kennedy too, but ultimately I bought these tickets for his birthday, to see YOU, at least once in our lives.
***My question is - Are you going to hang out after the show at all to take pictures or anything? I know it would make his absolute WORLD to say hey and get a photo with the dude that got him into playing a guitar.
We’re also going on 3 years sober and I think it’d be cool for him to meet one of his idols who’s also celebrating what, 15 years sober?! Congrats, btw man. That’s hard shit, but you’re killin’ it. I mean, this dude was influenced by the lifestyle of his music tastes which is what peaked his interest in drugs as a kid. I want to continue showing him how many incredible opportunities happen when sober that we spent so long missing out on and music has always made such a lasting impact on him.
Thanks for taking the time to check in with your fans, man. That’s pretty fuckin’ rad of you. 🖤",2022-02-07 21:50:12

smwttu,"Hi Slash, 
Huge fan here, totally loved the GNR concert in manila a few years ago. Too bad I was far out at the back :( It just kept playing in my head and in my dreams for a few months after the show. Unforgetable moment to be honest. 


Any chance we would see GNR/The Conspirators in manila anytime soon? 

Cheers! 🎩",2022-02-07 20:37:11
smwttu,"My fiancé and I will be at the opening show in PORTLAND,OREGON tomorrow night and can’t wait to see you play, Slash!! We both grew up listening to your music and as a musician himself, has idolized you his entire life (even dressed as you for Halloween as a kid - he’s 26). His guitar style is heavily influenced by YOU, Randy Rhoades and Zakk Wylde. We love Myles Kennedy too, but ultimately I bought these tickets for his birthday, to see YOU, at least once in our lives. 

***My question is - Are you going to hang out after the show at all to take pictures or anything? I know it would make his absolute WORLD to say hey and get a photo with the dude that got him into playing a guitar. 

We’re also going on 3 years sober and I think it’d be cool for him to meet one of his idols who’s also celebrating what, 15 years sober?! Congrats, btw man. That’s hard shit, but you’re killin’ it. I mean, this dude was influenced by the lifestyle of his music tastes which is what peaked his interest in drugs as a kid. I want to continue showing him how many incredible opportunities happen when sober that we spent so long missing out on and music has always made such a lasting impact on him. 

Thanks for taking the time to check in with your fans, man. That’s pretty fuckin’ rad of you. 

🖤 Take care and safe travels to Oregon! See ya tomorrow nigghht!!!",2022-02-07 20:42:35

I picked your autobiography for my 8th grade book assignment and my teacher was pissed and I loved it lol (the book and pissing the teacher off) When I was a kid I taught my best friend the Sweet Child o mine into and he annoyed his mom with it hours out of every day practicing. He got really good before he died of an od at 15. My question is; being a recovering heroin addict myself, what has been your biggest motivator for staying clean and what was Scotty Weiland like!?

All you beautiful dudes who felt like you were weird to be emotional and cry over little things are breaking my heart, I'm glad you are finding out that it's totally normal! Having feelings like that is an absolute blessing. (But sometimes a curse, I know.)

OP, I love that song. Eddie will catch you in the feels with most of his lyrics if you're not careful (for the love of god, go lightly around his Into the Wild album.) I wish you strength on your journey past this breakup. ❤️",2021-05-02 10:20:47

It's been devastating so I can't even imagine what ending 7 years and a marriage made you feel like. It's amazing to hear you speak positively and say that you've been handling it okay and that every day it gets a little easier. If you can keep your chin up I'm sure I can too ❤️

Best of luck to you sir, thanks for sharing this story",2021-05-01 21:11:45
n2m7tu,The break up song that does it for me is ABBA’s “The Winner Takes it All”. Back story is the couples in ABBA were married and both couples divorced. Imagine writing a break up song & bringing it into the studio for your ex to sing!  The lyrics made her cry.🥲 Check it out on YouTube,2021-05-01 22:46:56

n2m7tu,Was feeling like this until I realized only a few songs have made me cry 😂 but I’ll tell you the most recent one. The song is called ‘ghost town (voice memo) by Chloe George. The first part ALWAYS gets me to tear up or something and especially when she sings “freeeeee” it’s such a good cover and normal I don’t like covers and they don’t make me cry but this was the first cover of s song to make me cry really hard.

n2m7tu,"Phenomenal song. i remember it briefly from my younger years. And songs like that do hit home for some when going thru a personal crisis or ordeal. And sometimes just a rough patch of emotions during a stressful time in one's life. The Irony for me related to your testimony is I was just watching a recent episode of Cold Case. Which used to depict detectives solving crimes from many years ago.. Long story short, that song Black by Pearl Jam was playing at the end while the assailant (Daniel Baldwin) was being arrested.. i the vocals and chords took me back to my younger days of my 20's when I was going thru a lot of doubt's about my own self worth as a man. And why I wasn't further along in my life with Job, career, being an unwed father as so on.. I didn't remember the artist, but I google the TV show and episode immediately to see who  the song credits were attributed to. Low and behold it was Pearl Jam. Talk about Karma... The other interesting point as I read further is that the group and lead singer in particular leaned against the record company promoting that song in particular as a hit single. Which of course it was an INSTANT SMASH HIT CLASSIC that resonates with so many people and a poignant time in their lives including me.P. S. I'm a Black Man aged 56 and REAL Men do cry.❤💪",2024-05-10 16:03:48

n2m7tu,"I don't have words anon, and Im sorry for the necroo but I def feel that. I had a similar moment listening to Tame Impala recently where the song was just a sudden... Gut punch, almost a full decade after The Event. Suddenly I saw both the song and the Younger Me in a new light and I just wanted to shrink into my navel until I was a blackhole 😶",2023-07-23 04:45:57
n2m7tu,"I think most of us keep a lot pent up man. Tomorrows another day, but sometimes a good song can get you to cry and release all that pressure that stresses you out. Itll all work out, and youre doing alright bro. All youve done means something g, you just gotta keep going and see where it takes you. Have a good day from the 22 year old that finds our shared emotion in this song pretty cool 👍",2023-10-26 17:08:49

n2m7tu,"This post of your feel so realistic because I  completed 33year last December , but tonight I noticed something so similar about your post. Whenever I use to listen song I use to listen mostly because of the instruments / music  I never tried to understand lyrics, since english is my second language I never even thought about searching what the song lyrics ever meant and tonight while searching for a song meaning(name of the song: ""I'll be right behind you, Josephine "" by Josh Woodward) I came up with an amazing comment where this random guy explained each and every meaning of the lyrics and I felt so stupid that I never ever knew that some song can be so full of deep emotions and thanks to you I got one more artist/band name Pearl Jam 😄 . 
Thank you",2024-01-14 21:32:04

n2m7tu,"I love this thread. But just so everyone knows. It’s not your 20’s 30’s, fatherhood, divorce that all of a sudden gives you emotions. They have always been there. We as men are taught to be strong and tough. One of the strongest things we can do is be vulnerable. Share in these feelings… their not weird, or unmanly. It’s just because we’re all human. Things hit each of us differently. What IS something I will take away from this…. Look at all the support around us. We just have to learn to share how we’re feeling. 

Now for me tho, 😜 It was when I got sober. All of a sudden the charmin bear had wonderfully soft TP and I was overjoyed with tears for him, oh and I was 40 yrs old at the time. 

So yeah maybe there is something that catapults us into being ready for these emotions… awakens us, if you will. I had to start reaching out for help in my “new sober” world.  A major part of recovery is sharing your story with others and listening to others intently. 
Through this, I GOT OUT of my own way and just let myself feel things openly and discuss them with close friends or family or strangers on the internet. Sometimes I’ll cry now out of joy or sadness. Who knows. lol whatever the reason. It’s okay.",2024-02-29 01:39:43
n2m7tu,Hi there thanks for sharing. I love Pearl's Jams Eddie Vedder abd his deep lyrics. I cry about Chris Cornell's death everyday. I have become obsessed with him ❤️,2024-05-05 17:10:49
n2m7tu,"Absolutely!! Fully agree - I used to tease my mum all the time about crying at the end of Disney movies... I went and watched ‘Toy Story 3’ in the cinema alone while I was pregnant and cried hysterically... and since my darling one arrived, I’ve been worse than mum ever was! 😭",2021-05-02 10:56:15
n2m7tu,"Being more emotional doesn't come with age, it comes with life experience. When life grinds you just enough to break through all that bullshit pride. So some men feel it sooner than later, at least that's what I believe.

Up until I was 20-21 I wondered why I simply couldn't get tears running. Literally years have passed and I haven't shed a tear since I was a kid. I also remember when I first started to allow the tears to come out how much it hurt my tear ducts initially. Like it really hurt as the tears came out but then my eyes got used to it 😂

I think it's our job to let the next generation of men realize early on that it's okay to show that kind of emotion and not fail them like our fathers did.",2021-05-02 12:15:54

koci1g,Long time fan of MF DOOM.  I remember being in a college record store in 2005/6 and seeing Del the Funky Homosapiens first album on cd called I Wish My Brother George Was Here.  I also saw MF DOOM’s Dooms Day album on cd.  I decided to pickup Dels album thinking I could get the DOOMSDAY album at a later date.  I went back a few days later and it was gone... Easily my biggest regret regarding my history of album purchases. Anyway.  RIP MF DOOM 🙏 Your music had a big impact on my life,2021-01-02 03:34:15

I always assumed he just saw “metal” and assumed, now I wonder 🤔",2021-01-01 19:47:17
koci1g,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2021-01-01 23:49:39
