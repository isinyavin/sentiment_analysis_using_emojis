I've put them up on the 2nd of November one year, but I've also not put them up until 3 days after Christmas because the stress of people coming over for new year's eve was the thing that finally got me going once 😂 (we don't even celebrate Halloween here, let alone Thanksgiving, so I don't see a reason to definitely wait until after Thanksgiving)

I love Christmas. I love the music. I love my beautiful Christmas decor, 85% of which I didn’t pay a single cent for, because it’s mostly very sentimental hand-me-downs. I love sparkly shit. And it’s not even like it’s a “BUY BUY BUY SPEND SPEND SPEND” thing with me. I just like the feeling and the magic and again the decor is just so fun. 

It makes me happy and doesn’t hurt anyone. In our house, Christmas starts Nov 1st!

It brings me joy so I do it. If people hate it they don’t have to come and see it 🤣

rugocg,I was lucky enough to purchase a house right before the prices started to get insane. I want everyone to be able to afford a house but I would not be happy if my house suddenly became worth less than I paid for it. Selling this house someday is probably the only way I’m gonna be able to pay off my student loans 🥲,2022-01-02 22:43:04
rugocg,It will. 😂,2022-01-02 23:11:22
rugocg,"Yup, I'm 18 now and despite not even having a job, I've been anxiously hoping the housing market collapses soon since I was 16.


I'm in college now taking a pre-med major and even though I'm nowhere near that point, it's just a stress I have tucked away in a little corner of my brain until I actually reach that age and realize, well fuck, how am I gonna afford a house 🙃



At this point we need to start lumping Gen Z and Millennials together because a lot of stereotypically millennial stresses are also common among Gen Z due to the sheer number of millennials complaining (rightfully so) about the juxtaposition between the expectations for reaching life milestones by a certain age that they were led to believe by ~~c~~boomers, and the reality of this stage in our society. 



Plus many of us either have older siblings/relatives or older friends we see experiencing anxiety as their future approaches like a train. 



Personally, at this point, I'm living a lifestyle of balancing hedonism with a firm moral/ethical foundation so I can maximize the pleasure short term because I don't predict quality of life will improve. If our species can rest the responsibility of preventing complete global nuclear annihilation on two knucklehead leaders, be unable to eradicate all forms of racial prejudice centuries after it's peak prominence, and profit off of increased tuition costs at the expensive of fewer highly educated individuals to lead the world in the future, I have no hope. Call me pessimistic but this is just an aspect of the human condition. If the industrial revolution progressed despite the environmental damage, who fucking knows what humans will cook up next.",2022-01-03 14:41:06

Lived there for 3 years. Flipped it. Sold for 124,000 last year. Now live in a 140,000 with a little bit of land now. Profits we build a new garage mortgage went up $150 a month when we moved. But we got a little more bang for the buck being in a more ideal location, and have 5 acres. 
But… what we bought is dirt cheap compared to some areas I realize. Most people around me get homes at 24-25 years of age. 
I realize job opportunities are not as excellent where I live and schooling is also “alright” not awesome too. 
I should also add this is Northern Wisconsin near the Great Lake. In a little town of 500 people. About 40 minutes from to a town of 20,000 people.. that’s where we go to Walmart 🤣 so there is definitely some down falls.

Did we need the covid bill to get the people who are already vaccinated vaccinated? No? Ok than. Your argument is invalid.

elehnu,"Really it just comes down to text size and screen width. Each horizontal line uses blank braille instead of spaces, so they are all treated as really long words. It relies on all those words being more than half your display width, so two can't be next to each other. But as resolutions get higher and screens get bigger, more devices can put two ""words"" next to each other, breaking the art. So the original might look proper in portrait mode, but break if you switch to landscape.

fwsnwz,"This ~~sorta~~ happened with my Gram's cat when I was like 11/12 years old...

So, sadly Gram's cat disappeared, then a few weeks later I was at the SPCA with my mom when I saw an identical cat that I *swore* was the missing mouser. I called gram up to excitedly explain the good news & she came by to pick the cat up (I believe she showed pictures as proof? This was probably '00/'01 so it's a bit blurry..) and took her home. 

...We only realized that it wasnt the same cat when some time later we found her giving birth in the linen cupboard 🙀 ...which was certainly unexpected since the OG cat was fixed 😅

Ended up working out in the end since the new cat was much friendlier & gave birth to a kitten I took home & she ended up being the coolest cat companion. And she lived almost 20 years! The surprise birth happened on Good Friday, [so ^obviously I named her Friday..] and she passed on just last year. She was a baddass 🤘 Keep on rockin, Friday 😻",2020-04-08 03:57:58

Actually where did he get his cat from originally? Their may be a whole litter of them waiting to come home?

What about the owner of one he took or one he took in? Found any : seeing any?lost and found posters or wanted signs? 

Some man took my kitty but that's ok my Bill's have gone down and I am no longer a prisoner to meow meow meow... I think she was an alien from outer space she always seemed to be stalking me...I would see her everywhere I went. I swear one time I saw 9 of her crossing the street in front of a semi and her eyes turned colors in the sun... don't get her wet!!! She eats 9 cans a day... hungry cat...
Have fun with your new best friends!!!

Only kidding, doesn't every pet take over our lives? We let them... those to are conspiring though....its written in their smile they look really happy...

11tka71,I'm a successful man and women still don't want me 😂,2023-03-31 03:34:09
11tka71,Yeah I remember going for a mortgage and being told by the mortgage lender that I need to take out additional credit cards in order to qualify for a mortgage. 🤔,2023-03-17 17:21:28
11tka71,"Agreed. Once they allowed a scam charge of 19,000 for a fiat in Amsterdam on my card. With a limit of 2500 bucks. 

I do not have a license. I was not in Amsterdam. I can't drive. I especially didn't buy a 19k fiat. To make a long story a bit shorter, I'll never use TD, TD will never want me, and I will absolutely never be paying that money. When on the phone with the agent about how the charge was even processed on a card with a 2.5k limit, the girl literally said ""sometimes that just happens."" 

With interest fees, my last bill from a debt collector was around 32k, but they'd so generously take the original 19k they say. I'm never paying it, my credit has recovered slowly over the years, and I still managed to buy a house so why should I?

Fuck TD, but shoutout to the guy who got them to buy him a fiat 💪",2023-03-17 13:01:27
11tka71,"They didn’t have the cash app in Europe 20 years ago. Again, I understand your use of hyperbole to really slam that point home, but is so factually inaccurate that it doesn’t make the point you want it to. Instead it makes you come across as whiny. 

That’s not how hyperbole is meant to be used. Hyperbole should be obvious absurdism. When you use it to conflate years with slightly more years it’s just misinformation.

The light years one is good. That’s how you’re supposed to use it. If you’re gonna go hyperbole, go all in. 😊

Keeping a ledger is about more than just creating bumpers on your overdrafts. It’s good to put your hands on the numbers and work with them a little bit. But you do you.",2023-03-17 15:15:34
11tka71,I know it's not a bailout and I don't care- it's just funnier to watch you whine about downvotes because no one gives a shit what you have to say 😆,2023-03-17 12:41:55
hob8xc,It is my birthday today and I bought $100 worth of Pokémon cards and got a $500 tattoo 🤣,2020-07-10 05:04:38

hob8xc,"I've had so many bad birthdays I don't even bother anymore 😂

hob8xc,😂,2020-07-10 13:36:08
hob8xc,I realised that my bday was just another day when I invited my friends for a night out only 2 turned up. Then the following year my parents said they were going to do stuff so they couldn’t do anything with me and then I find that they were spending the day with my brother. It’s not like me and him don’t talk we live together 😢,2020-07-13 19:18:47
hob8xc,People can’t catch a break. Get criticized for celebrating your birthday. Get shitted on for not wanting to celebrate your birthday. What can you do? 🤷‍♂️,2020-07-10 00:55:16

hob8xc,No - I just don’t think I need a some kind of reward for being born. It’s not like I had anything to do with it😕,2020-07-10 03:05:34
hob8xc,"I don’t do anything for my birthday because for 1. Its expensive & and a waste of time IMO 
2. I don’t care as long as i at least get some money 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️💵",2020-07-10 03:15:44
hob8xc,My mom scheduled a photo shoot for my sweet 16. She realized after and talked to me about it. She said she was sorry and would reschedule it if I REALLLY wanted her to (she put emphasis on the really.) then continued to talk about how it would look very unprofessional for her to reschedule it yada yada. I got the hint and said it was fine and that I was getting too old for parties anyways. Even tho I secretly was very heart broken and cried later. I messaged my friends if they were free that day and asked if they wanted to hang out. I didn’t mention my bday cause I just didn’t want them to make a hassle over something so small. Woke up bday morning to one of my friends messaging in all caps that it was my bday?!?!  Cause of a fb notification. I said yeah but it’s not a big deal. And not to worry about anything. I get to her house and we all got together. She surprised me with mini cupcakes and we all played video games together ☺️ I just wanted to cry because these girls I knew less than a year cared enough about me to make a fuss. Even when my mom didn’t. They are still my best friends many years later.,2020-07-10 03:20:11
hob8xc,Birthdays make me sad 🙃,2020-07-10 00:07:32
hob8xc,I don’t care about my birthday. But I’m the most immature person in the world. They literally don’t mean anything 😂,2020-07-10 00:52:38

qbwyd3,"I disagree. I once saw an injured ant being taken care of by two of his buddies. He injured his legs or something and each of the ants walked on either side of him, guiding him off of a ledge, guiding him back home, and was walking at his pace. It was honestly the most incredible thing I’ve seen and that was evidence to me that they’re more than just “biological robots piloted by instinct”. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Also studies have shown that lobsters feel physical pain and I’ve always been like, duh. Of course they do. It’s baffles me people have believed otherwise just because they have a smaller or perhaps “simpler” neurological system. I study biology in college by the way, so I know how intricate these living being are.",2021-10-20 21:08:11

8vzmij,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Wednesday frog. The meme is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of r/me_irl most of the memes will go over a typical r/all redittor's head. There's also the frog's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these memes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Wednesday frog truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the frog's existencial catchphrase ""It is Wednesday, my dudes"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as kidpix2's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Wednesday frog tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
You want to know why I love Wednesday frog? Wednesday frog is a completely self-made meme. So many other memes are based in nostalgic childrens shows, funny faces, relatable situations, or references. Not Wednesday frog. Wednesday frog is completely absurd. It's a low-res generic toad, and an arbitrary method of celebrating Wednesday. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog did not do so out of recognition. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog did not do so because a pre-existing meme format. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog upvoted a meme literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower. Wednesday frog is evidence that humans can stare into the meaningless void of eternity and force their own meaning onto to it. I will always upvote Wednesday frog, my dudes!",2018-07-31 00:45:24

8vzmij,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Wednesday frog. The meme is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of r/me_irl most of the memes will go over a typical r/all redittor's head. There's also the frog's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these memes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Wednesday frog truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the frog's existencial catchphrase ""It is Wednesday, my dudes"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as kidpix2's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Wednesday frog tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",2018-07-04 07:41:23

Day 2 - you will cross paths with an old friend you have missed.

Day 3 - you will find yourself with a lot of money.

Day 4 - your day will be perfect.

Day 5 - the love of your life will kiss you.

Don't break this. Send it to 14 friends in 10 minutes. 

It's not that hard. Whoever sent this to you must care about you.

Don't know how to send it? Lol. Just hold your finger on it and it should say forward.",2017-07-13 03:31:40

qg2ubx,"It's from the perspective of an individual and a relationship that we were not apart of. I'm not a fan of getting involved in people's personal lives especially when it's about topics as emotional charged as raising a potential human. I'm confused as to why she even made the video if not to publically shame him. She wanted to expose him as a bad guy, but why? I just don't get it. I'm still going to watch the video she made and form my opinion based off of that, but I haven't been able to because of classes.

Just from my pre opinion I don't understand why she made the video. If she thought he was a bad guy, she already divorced him. Why make the video? Again I just don't see a reason other than attention. I don't know why the internet is so involved with public personalities private life. This seems like such a weird violation of privacy.

qfrajw,"When I was a Lyft driver for a short time. People would mark themselves in stupid places and I would have to try and call to find them. You wouldn't believe the amount of times people would send me to VM repeatedly. Sometimes the app text messages wouldn't go through, or they would take a while to process/send it so I would just call. Lyft would change our numbers to like a 315 area code or whatever and people would deny it. I would call them repeatedly... you'd think they'd get the hint, like... you just ordered a service and the car that you ordered is near you but can't find you, and now your phone is blowing up? 🤔🤔 so when the timer would get past 5 minutes we were allowed to cancel without any penalties and get a time and trouble fee, I'd always try one last time... Sometimes that worked because then they'd be like ""Hello!? HELLO!?? Are you my Lyft? I'm so sorry plz don't cancel 😢  I didn't know that was you!"" But it's ike... who else would it be?

h0wkxe,"I think this is where a lot of people get the two systems confused. There are international standards for volume as well. Just because you are not using cups, doesn't mean you have to weigh everything. I grew up using deciliters, which is pretty close to a half cup. It is the practice of using volume to measure stuff that eventually leads to weighing, not specifically using cups or spoons.
Imagine figuring out what one cup of cold butter is. 
Weighing offers higher precision and in the international standard system there is a clear relation between volume and weight, for water at least. Now this also seems to be the case with one cup being half a pound, which is also 8 ounces, right?
The real advantage of using SI units is the prefixes, not really the amount each unit corresponds to (even though that also makes more sense 😅) 


But I have both cups, deciliters, spoons and scales in my kitchen. Most of the time the few grams off here and there don't matter, but in baking for instance... Volumetric measurements of flour is a science.",2020-06-11 16:11:23

fs72im,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  


And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. 😎",2020-03-31 09:46:41

g5f6vr,"The Germans in WWI were terrified of Canadians, since they were the most brutal and effective in trench warfare (mostly because of [Fake News](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucified_Soldier)©) They took no prisoners, no wounded or allowed the enemy to disengage. 

They were also the only ones [not to respect the Christmas Truce](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/the-forgotten-ferocity-of-canadas-soldiers-in-the-great-war).

Canadians had a bad rep from every side of the war, both allies and enemies considered them pointlessly brutal and irrespective of the rules of war, both official and unofficial.

Discounting many legends about cannibalism and other inhuman acts of violence, there are few testimonies of the Canadian's senseless vuolence.:

During the tin can exchanges that were popular among troops stationed in trenches close enough to be at earshot, the Canadians would respond to the German corned beef with grenades disguised as cans of food.

Wounded or surrendered enemies were almost always killed, then booby trapped to kill those who would  try to retrieve the bodies for burial during the Quiet.

Canadians were the masters of trench raiding, with the only strategic objective of slowly massacring the enemy in their own barracks, without ever conquering the territory.

>Before the attack on Vimy Ridge, veteran Archie McWade said he was told, “Remember, no prisoners. They will just eat your rations.”

Basically the Second Geneva Convention was created to stop armies to act like Canada, which [did not attend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907#/media/File%3AConvention_respecting_the_laws_and_customs_of_war_on_land.svg) the 1907 Hague Convention, despite being part of the Commonwealth.",2020-04-21 17:50:43

I searched the internet and as jackalt said, its not a thing. I think she know Im attracted to her, what do you guys think?",2022-02-15 19:40:34

wjeuxs,"I FUCKING HATE FAJITAS!!
I worked at chilis and we always dreaded when someone ordered a fajitas cuz they would 100% be a pain to serve. 

So the only thing cooked is the meat the rest is just thawed in our thermalizer. Once the meat is done (the severs/food runners/QA) have to heat it all on a skillet top covered for about 80 secs. While that’s going we have to warm the tortillas (corn is a MF’er to deal with). Then you gotta time it so the tortillas don’t get too cold but you don’t want to wait too long or else the fajita mix would not sizzle and be “too cold” when it came out even though it was still steaming 🙄",2022-08-09 00:27:11

kvlyh2,"You 👉 may 🗓 be onto 🐦 something 😅 here. Memes 🐸 used 🎶 to be simple 😡. Relatable 🧠. Worth 🤑💰💳 a chuckle 😀🙂😆. Then they evolved 🤓🗿🏰. New 👌 formats 🤡🙃👌, new 🆕🆒 tag ❌ lines 〰, new 🆕 content 🌍✔ that was then turned 😍 into a new 🆕 meme 🐸. Then memes 😂 became ❓ increasingly 🌝 meta 🆕✔ and self 💯 reflective 💡. They parodied themselves and the users 🏻 who both made 👉 them and consumed 😓🥄🧟‍♂️ them. They built 🔧🔨 off 📴 of one ☝🤔❓ another 2️⃣. They grew 🌱. They morphed into something 😅 entirely 🇺🇸 novel 😐😋☺. This progressed ↗ to the point 📍 where even 🌃 that wasn't enough 💦. They had to become 💦 something 😅 more than themselves. They became ❓ surreal. They became ❓ deep 😂🤔😱 fried 🔥 and nuked 😈. Each flavor 😵😰 building 👷 off 📴 of the last 😍 and transforming ✨ into a nearly 👣 intangible 👻, unknown ❓ entity 🚹.

Art 🎨 progressed ↗ in a similar 👱 fashion 🙂. Started 🆕 off 📴 simple 😡, I'm 💘 talking 🗣🧠 cave 🕳 drawing 🎨 simple 🔢. Then some pottery 👀💦 and some small 👌 abstract 👩🏽‍🎤 sculptures 🗿. Subjects 😙 everyone 👥 could relate 👫 to and understand 📚. Then, as technology 📱💻 allowed 😖 for the creation 😮 of cultures 👳🏾 and societies 🌍👥, art 🎨 began 🔘 to reflect 🔎👁 that change 🚼👫 and it evolved 🚶🐆🐇 along 💁 with it. By the Ancient 🗿🎼 Greeks 🍆🇬🇷 and Romans 💯, art 👌🏼🎨🍕 had become 😌 a more advanced 🎊 version ℹ of the Stone 💎 and Bronze 🥉🤔 Age 👴👵 arts 🎨. Better 👍 drawings 🎨, paintings 🖌🎨, and the addition ➕ of mosaics. Sculptures 🎨 eventually 💦🍆 shifted 🔀 from stylistic 😎 expression 🚛 to naturalistic representation 🇺🇸. Still 🤞🙌 accessible 🔖 to everyone 👥, yet 😇 more nuanced and complex 🏢.

After 2️⃣ the fall 🍂 of Rome 🏛 art 🎨 stagnated and didn't change 📈 very 👌 much 🔥 for nearly 👣 a millennium 💯. Early 🕐 Christian ✝👬 art 🎨 dominated 😩 for the most part 🍆, consisting of murals and frescos and simple 😡 statues 🗽. All 💯 of which were based ✊👌 on 🔛💦 the Ancient 📜 styles 😎. Romanesque and Gothic art 🖼🔥 also 👨 built 👷‍♀️ upon 👦 these precedents. This all 💯 changed 🚼 when ⏰ the Renaissance attacked 👊.

A cultural ⛩ explosion 💣 changed 🚼 the art 🙇🎨 world 🌎 forever 🕐🕔🕤; arguably 🗣 starting 🔘 with the Italian 👌 artist 🎨, Giotto. He 👨 began 🔘 using 📤🏻 techniques 💡 like 😄 foreshortening and linear 💨 perspective 👀 so that the material 💎 world 🌎 could be represented 🅱 as it appeared 🤔😐 to us 👨. A callback to the naturalistic stylings of the Greeks 🇬🇷. Almost 💦 like 👍😊 a reference 📖 to the days 🌞 of yore 👉. A celebration 🎊🎉 of how art 🎨 used 🎶 to be, but 🍑 with the explosion 💥☄ of new 👌 techniques 🥋🤹 and technologies 📱, the art 🎨 grew 🌱 increasingly 🌝 diverse 👱🏿. New 🆕 and improved ✔ frescoes, meticulously crafted 👌 sculptures ⛏, architectural marvels 😻 and the inclusion 💨 of new 👌 materials 💎 in these works 💼. Instead 🚔 of tempera, oil 💦 was introduced 👹 along 💁 with new 👌🚘 styles 😎 of depicting 🖼 light 💡 and shadow 👤 through sfumato and chiaroscuro. These techniques 🔧❌ and stylistic 😎🤩 changes 📈, while impressive 😍, were simply 😡 an advancement 🎊 of pre 🎀 established 🔍 art 🎨. The Renaissance paved the way 💫 for the explosion 💣 and diversification 🌈 of dozens 🌹 of art 🎨 movements 👣 that followed 👀.

From prehistoric 🤠 art 🎨😤 to the end 🔚 of the Renaissance, art 🎨🍆😫 was mostly 💯😶 about 💦 the same subjects 🏫 and used ♦ similar 👱 techniques 🔧❌ to accomplish 💰 the goal 💕💦😫 of producing 😥🔫 a work 💼 of art 🎨. Yes ❗✅😊, the technical 🥋🤹 proficiency exponentially improved ✔ but 🍑 considering 🤔 the centuries 💯 in between 👉👈, few true 💯 advancements 🎊 were made 👉.

Compare ⚖ this to memes 🐸. They were so simple 🔢 at first 👆 and really 💯 were nothing 🚫 more. Then they got 🍸 better 👍. More technical 🥋🤹. More circumstantial ❌. More media 💦 to create 💯 them with. But 🍑 memes 🐸 could last 😍 years 🗓 or many 👬 months ‼🆘📆 before 😂 dying 💀‼ off 📴. As time ⏰ went 💨 on 🔛, the longevity 📊 of a meme 🐸 shortened. This is paralleled ⏸ in the art 🖌🖼 world 🌎.

After 👀 the Renaissance the Baroque period 😩🍫 started 🆕. Then the Neo-Classicism, Romantic 💕❤😍, Realism 😳, and Impressionism movements 👣 not long 🍆 after 2️⃣. Still 🤞🙌 utilizing the same technical 🔧❌ process 🏭 but 🍑 the reasoning 🤔 behind ↩ the movements 📦 changed 🚼. No 🚫 longer 🍆 was it about 🤔💭 simply 😡 depicting 🖼 the world 🌎 around 🔃 us 🇺🇸, it was about 💦 prompting ❓ the viewer 👀 to consider 🤔 new 👌 thoughts 🤔 and ideas 😏💡. Urging 😩 them to look 👀💏 past 💦 the image 🖼👀 and think 🤔🇮🇹 deeper 😩💦 about 💦 meaning 😏 and context 🔎. Pushing ✋🏽 the boundaries ⛓ of what art 🎨 could be. The Baroque to Impressionism era 💦🌹 spanned roughly 🤕 300 💦 years 🗓. Compare ⚖ that to the thousands 💯 of years 📅😒 between 😉 archaic art 🎨 and the Renaissance. It was a huge 😤 explosion 💥🧨🎉 of self 💯 expression 😤. Finally 👆, in the mid 😝 to late 🕛 19th 📆 century 💯 starting 🔘 with Post-Impressionism, Modern 🖥 art 🎨 emerged. This movement 📦 focused 👁🔎 on 🔛 self-consciousness, self-reference, introspection, existentialism, and even 🌃 nihilism 👀. I'm 💘 talking 💬 Fauvism, Cubism, Futurism 👾, Dada 😂😫🤪, Abstract 👩🏽‍🎤 Expressionism, and Surrealism to name 📛 the most well 😤 known 🎓.

These styles 😎🤩 changed 🚼 what art 🎨 could be. They were no 🚫👎 longer 🍆 about 💦 depicting 🖼🎨📸 life 💓 as is, or layering 💽 a painting 🖌 with hidden 👐 motifs 🌚🌝 for only the privileged 💁 to understand 📚, they were in and of themselves absurd 🤪. Abstract 👩🏽‍🎤 shapes 🤙👀, aggressive 😡😦 lines 〰 and colors 🎨, nonsensical 🙄🙃🤪 dreamscapes. But 🍑 it didn't stop ❌✋ there.

Post-modernism. Pushing ✋🏽 art 🎨 to the limit 💃 of its potential 😧. Pop 💥 art 🎨, Conceptual 🤔 art 🎨, Minimalism, Fluxus, Installation 💯 art 🎨, Lowbrow art 🎨, Performance 🅱 art 🎨, Digital 👧🏿 art 🖼, Earth 🌏 art 🎨. These movements 📦 are about 💦 skepticism 🤔🤯, irony 😂🤪, rejecting grand 🔝 narratives 🛬 and reason 🌟 and instead 🚔 embracing 👨 the idea 💡 that knowledge 🎓 and truth 🙌 are the result 💹 of social 👨👥, historical 🚫, and political 🇺🇸 discourse 🤤💯 and subsequently 😎 are a subjective 🤦‍♂️, social 👥 construct 👷🏼‍♂️🛠. It's irreverent and self-referential. It's avant-garde pushed 🙈 to 11 🕚.

But 🤔🤤☹ what's 😦 next ➡📷? Post-postmodernism? Metamodernism? Hypermodernity? Who knows 🤔? Only time ⏰ will tell 🗣.

This is where memes 🤣😂 are headed 💩. They started 💢 off 📴 slow 🐢 but 🍑 have picked ⚒ up ☝ so much 🔥 momentum they're 👨 evolving 🌚 at an exponential pace ⏰⚠. They used 🎶 to hang 😜 around 🔃 for a couple 👌 years 🗓⏱ at most. Then it turned ↪↩ to months 📆. Then maybe 🤔 only one 👆☝ month 🗓. Suddenly 😲 it was a week 🗓 tops 🔝. While some particularly 😇 great 👍 memes 🐸 do still 🤞🙌 stick 🍆 around 🧱🎶🎵 much 🔥 like 😄 the masterpieces 🤩 of art 🎨 in the past 💦, new 🆕🚗 memes 🐸 are created 🔨🎨 every 💯 day 📆, every 💯 few hours 🕐. New 🆕 movements 📦 of memes 😂🤣👌🏻 are being created 🔨🎨 all 💯 the time ⏰. Anti-memes. Dank 👌 memes 🐸. Abstract 👩🏽‍🎤 memes 🐸. Wholesome 🤗💯 memes 🐸. Surreal memes 🐸. Deep 😱 fried 🔥 memes 🐸. Nuked ☄ memes 🐸🔍. Even 🌝 black ⬛ hole 🕳 memes 🐸, time 🕰⏰ travel ✈🚢🗿, and dimensional memes 🐸 are now a reality 💯. What's 🤔 going 👉 to happen 😱 next 👉? A return 🔙 to the classics 👴? A new 🆕 format 🤡🙃👌 so brilliant 🤖 it steals 💰 all 😤 our hearts 💔🤒 and then starts 🔘 a whole 💦🍔 new 🆕 movement 👣? I'm 💘 excited 👀😃💦 for the future 📅 of memes 🐸.

I couldn’t tell whether you were

1. Trying to say that most people experience some of the things people with ADHD go through and that’s why people often relate to them, despite probably not having adhd.

2. ADHD people are just lazy and making up excuses

3. Similar to the first one, people mistake some of the symptoms and experiences of having adhd as the whole deal, when it’s more than that, and you might be irritated at people constantly being like “so relatable!” When it’s more than just the memes.

pwdopk,"Psychiatrist. A therapist, psychologist, or master's of social work are all wonderful credentials and exceptionally skilled at talking things out and perceiving things differently... But they can't write a prescription. So you talk to them, they say yeah I think ADHD might apply then you start over with finding a medication person. 

Start by looking into what executive dysfunction actually is because it's definitely not that hyper little boy running around the classroom. Look into the diagnostic criteria in the DSM 5 and see if a. you relate and b. It's impacting multiple areas of your life now and in childhood to a clinically significant degree. Then talk to your primary care physician for a psychiatrist referral or find one in network with insurance and make an appointment with them directly. Most important, you might think you meet the criteria for ADHD but the psychiatrist must rule out your symptoms being caused by any other possibility, that's why so many of us get stuck in ""anxiety and depression"" diagnostic column for so many years. 17 years on SSRI and STILL anxious and depressed. Low and behold 6 months of no SSRI and yes to Adderall and I'm not fucking depressed anymore cause my executive will mother fucking function. I'm not anxious about unpaid bills if I can organize my mind to focus on paying them. Who knew!

edit88888: So there’s a chick in my class I like; unfrotunately im quiet, calculated and intelligent and she likes big dumb jocks. So anyway one day me and her boyfriend are walking among a group of our felow students when a gang banger appears and threatens with a gun. Her ‘big and though’ boyfriend instantly freezes and loses the ability to speak. I on the other hand squint my eyes and step forward pulling my katana for judo practise out in one fell swoop. “Go ahead” I say. The gun is only 400 years old while the sword is the child of many millenia. Do you fancy the odds?“ Instantly the gang-banger drops his weapon and runs. My other classmates cheer while her jock boyfriend pretends the whole thing was funny. She looks at me and sees what she didnt see before. She thanks me with a kiss, but I don’t smile because I was only doing my duty. Safe to say she saw who a real man was that day. I may be quiet and collected, but raise a weapon against me and youll face your worst nightmare",2018-03-14 13:39:38

12kp1au,"I had to [break some of these down into individual gifs](https://imgur.com/a/MCv8jdJ) to analyze them more closely.

Seriously I want to meet the person who came up with all this, this person must own the gym because no typical gym member could get away with using the equipment like this, they would be kicked out so fast 😂

Let's start with the first one, he's doing split lunges with one foot on the seat of a rowing machine and the other foot on a bosu ball while doing back squats with an entire squat rack on his back 😂

The next one someone is down there with a leg press while he's bench pressing a rowing machine, and above the leg press he's also pressing the weight of a man up there doing cable rows

Third guy makes a beautiful kinetic art piece of himself elevated on way too many boxes doing deadlift rows with barbells connected in parallel series, 



And the guy hanging upside down doing neck lifts with a trash can and a vacuum cleaner fastened to either side of whatever that deadlift rack is called

And this is clearly a state-of-the-art gym with the best equipment because the treadmill that last guy is on is the curved kind of look at him holding a tire above his head",2023-04-13 14:27:24

12kp1au,"I'm dead 💀 (biologically speaking I am, in fact, alive. However, to emphasize how hilarious I found this, I made a hyperbolic statement saying that I was dead because it implies that I found this video so funny I ceased to live. However, I am indeed alive and well so there is no need for you all to worry. I was simply employing the tactic of figurative language in order to better and more effectively communicate my message. Additionally, using slang and sayings commonly employed by the youth has made my message more understandable and reachable by the younger generation, many of whom are in this chat. For example, I could have said ""that video was a real knee slapper"". This would have made sense to some of the older people in this chat as knee slapping used to be a sign of hilarity. However, in this digital age in which we now live, knee slapping is not as common and many of today's youth may not understand the reference. I therefore made my message more understandable to younger people through my use of simple, easily understood slang. I hope this clears everything up, and I appreciate any concern that I was actually dead. I can assure you I am alive and well.)",2023-04-13 18:49:52

***Dora the Explorer*** is an American animated television series created by [Chris Gifford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Gifford_(actor)), Valerie Walsh Valdes and Eric Weiner that premiered on [Nickelodeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon) on August 14, 2000. The series is produced by [Nickelodeon Animation Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon_Animation_Studio) and is one of the longest-running series that aired on the Nick Jr. block.

## 

## Plot

📷From left to right: Swiper (in background), Dora, and Boots

The series centers around Dora, a seven-year-old Latina girl, with a love of embarking on quests related to an activity that she wants to partake of or a place that she wants to go to, accompanied by her talking [purple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple) [backpack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpack) and anthropomorphic monkey companion named Boots (named for his beloved pair of red [boots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots)). Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora's travels, along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve (with ""assistance"" from the viewing audience) relating to [riddles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddles), the Spanish language, or counting. Common rituals may involve Dora's encounters with Swiper, a [bipedal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipedal), [anthropomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphic) masked thieving [fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox) whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through [fourth wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall)\-breaking interaction with the viewer. To stop Swiper, Dora must say ""Swiper no swiping"" three times. However, on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other people, the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the stolen items. Another obstacle involves encounters with another one of the program's antagonists; the ""Grumpy Old Troll"" dwelling beneath a [bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge) that Dora and Boots must cross, who challenges them with a riddle before permitting them the past that needs to be solved with the viewer's help. Known for the constant breaking of the fourth-wall depicted in every episode, the audience is usually presented to two primary landmarks that must be passed before Dora can reach her destination, normally being challenged with games or puzzles along the way. The episode always ends with Dora successfully reaching the locale, singing the ""We Did It!"" song with Boots in triumph.

On numerous occasions, television specials have been aired for the series in which the usual events of regular episodes are altered, threatened, or replaced. Usually said specials will present Dora with a bigger, more whimsical adventure than usual or with a magical task that must be fulfilled, or perhaps even offer a series of different adventures for Boots and Dora to travel through. They might be presented with an unusual, difficult task (such as assisting Swiper in his attempts to be erased from Santa Claus's Naughty List) that normally is not featured in average episodes, or challenge Dora with a goal that must be achieved (such as the emancipation of a trapped [mermaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid)). Sometimes, the specials have involved the debut of new characters, such as the birth of Dora's superpowered twin baby siblings and the introduction of the enchanted anthropomorphic [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) that accompany Dora on many of her quests.

6pll5h,"I refuse to be a part of this. Wednesday frog isn't special anymore. It gets posted too frequently, it is the lowest of low effort, and should be abolished.

First, Wednesday frog isn't special. People post it like every week. 

Second, Wednesday frog is the lowest of low effort. I put in no effort to thinking today and I thought of Wednesday frog. 

Finally, it should be abolished. Wednesday frog is ruining our sub's creative potential. Let's oust this 🐸

In conclusion, Wednesday frog isn't special anymore. It gets posted too frequently, it is the lowest of low effort, and should be abolished.
