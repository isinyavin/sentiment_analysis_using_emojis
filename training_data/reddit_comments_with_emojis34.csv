i am the kit,  so very small,

there used to be another...

n yet - i barely can recall,

you  humans called her

'mother'...

you  cried that day she went away,

the tears streamed down your face

i think that's when i heard you say

you'd try n take her place...

n now the way you're  brushing me -

it makes  me feel so calm....

somehow, a distant memory...

can i just call you

'mom' ?

i feel the Love - your gentle touch,

you're calling me 'good boy'

the *brushing* that i Love so much,

i'm Crying tears

of Joy!

He's the sweetest cat but I wish we could keep him inside.   We watched him get hit by a car one night (he is down to 8 lives now!) and we texted the owners to tell them to maybe have him checked out and they didn't care. I try to keep him happy indoors though and we play with him even though we're both slightly allergic lol Cats are the best.",2022-04-21 22:29:13

I hope you know your choice mattered. ❤",2021-07-09 04:23:02
oggmyx,Adopted a 12yr old Dalmatian once. He had actually already been sent for euthanasia and I caught them before they did it. He lived another two years with me and was much loved. His previous owner had Alzheimer’s and was no longer able to care for him. Older animals are the best and deserve great homes! ❤️❤️,2021-07-09 06:58:17
oggmyx,"I took in an old dog that was abused most it’s life, had teeth falling out and some serious neurological issues where’s I’d see him stand one foot in his water bowl eating food not even noticing or sleeping with just one leg on his bed and the rest off. He used to sleep a lot (and snored) cause I think he was ready to shuffle off his mortal coil after a long battered life. 
He took to me out of the rest of the family for some reason, maybe I was just as fucked up as him.

One for my few regrets in life was not staying with him when they put him down I just couldn’t bring myself
To see it’s and I still hear his yells and howls to this day. Rest easy Tripp. Hope I gave you at least a few good last years after so much abuse and I hope you can forgive me for not being there in the final goodbye 😭",2021-08-14 09:41:28

Other living things start to smell also as they get older, but at least you can wash the exterior. Old cats put a film of stink on themselves every time they ""clean"" themselves.

oggmyx,"My heart 🥺 when we have our own house I want to rescue older kitties. When we lived in FL we rescued an old gal who lived outside our complex. Neighbors who lived there for 10+ years said she was out there skinny when they moved in. We scooped her up, bathed and fed her, and she slept for 3 days in a laundry basket with a blanket. We named her Olive. She had the biggest, wisest eyes and a raspy meow. Took her to the vet to learn she had kidney and liver disease, and she was at least 15 years old. She was my first cat and our first child together. We had her for about 7 months before losing her. It was the hardest thing ever to hold her on my chest before the vet visit knowing she would be gone in a few hours. We sobbed in the office for over an hour before we could bear to let her go. But man, she lived out those last few months to the fullest. Eating, sleeping, all the cuddles. Not a care in the world. I told her every day how strong and beautiful she was. Damnit now I'm crying lol we have her ashes and a lil vile of fur with a photo album in the living room. Love you forever, Olive.",2021-07-09 06:09:53

oggmyx,"Last year, we adopted a 10 year old tabby and a 7 year old huge black floofy cat (they both lived together prior to their owners becoming ill and surrendering them), and the past year with them has made my life so much better. I’d do it again a thousand times. She only started doing this 6 months ago, but our tabby crawls on my chest and nuzzles my face while purring and it makes me so damn happy ❤️ I know I am going to be utterly destroyed whenever they pass over the rainbow bridge but it’s all worth it knowing that they know they’re safe and loved by us.",2021-07-09 00:50:07

oggmyx,"I'm allergic to cats a bit! We adopted house bunnies instead, highly recommend ❤️",2021-07-08 23:00:59
oggmyx,"Also pet rats are amazing. I've had cats and dogs, but my rattos were the cuddliest, friendliest little boys ever. Everyone gets super weirded out by it but then once meeting them, they understood immediately. A year since we lost them and I miss them every single damn day. They're like a mix of cats and dogs all wrapped into one, it's the best description I can give. 
They sense emotion, love affection and have so much personality. And wow can they be SASSY!! 
They had a cage, but the doors were never closed unless we were cleaning the house or something was happening. Literally, free roam rattos. 
 Ferguson would play fetch with you. He knew the sound of my bfs car and would run to wait at the door when he heard it (how I knew bf was home). He had a 'thing' with everyone, like sitting between my one friend's huge boobs and just pop his head out,, other friend he had to sit on her right shoulder when she visited, he had to sit on bfs dad head (like the top lol) at least once a visit,, other friend he was obsessed with her jacket pocket (inside pocket, so he'd climb in a pop his head out and be so snug)  -- it was honestly so damn beautiful. Every morning, he'd hear the sound of my bfs spoon in his futurelife bowl and would RUN,, but their excited runs are more like HOP scamper HOP scamper. He'd join me when I was napping, just snuggle slightly under the blanket (so his head popped out, like a human haha) and would nap with me instead of in his own bed. When his brother passed away, he made the decision himself to sleep by my bf and is feet every single night. If we tried putting him in his own bed, he'd sqweek until he was allowed to choose where to sleep (at our feet). 
His brother, Cecil, was more cat-like. You could only love him when he wanted love, for as long as he deemed fit. He was a bit of a dick tbh, but still loveable 😂 they looked after each other so much. Cecil was skittish, so new places weren't his favorite. He'd usually stay in his hammock, while Ferguson would make multiple trips filling his mouth with food, running to Cecil to drop it off by him, running down to fill his mouth again and giving it to Cecil. It was SO CUTE. When Cecil passed, we realized that it was him who'd been doing doing cage cleans - we'd wake up in the morning and ALL (yes all) dirty linen and tissue paper would be pushed out the cage. Because Cecil did a clean. Obviously we still cleaned their cage (3 x a week) , but Cecil would do the inbetweens I guess.
Such beautiful pets.
Such bad, wrong reputations. 
Sorry but I really miss my babies 😭🙈",2021-07-09 07:20:37

q25ttb,"Thank you so much for doing this. I worked at a pet shop years ago and we had a partnership with a cat shelter. We would keep kittens and cats in a large cage and people would adopt all the time. 

Then there was Damian. He was FIV positive and had no teeth at all. Maybe 11 years old, road rash on his head from getting hit by a car. Sweetest cat ever. He had lived almost his entire 11 years in the shelter. 

After two years roaming the shop as our resident kitty, a fantastic family finally adopted him. Good people exist ❤️",2021-10-05 23:00:42

q25ttb,"My cat Jackson is only 1 when I adopted him but he was returned 3 times before I got him because he was a black cat. One didn’t like that he was talkative, one didn’t like he didn’t photograph well and wasn’t super clingy, the other I can’t remember. 

I just adopt older cats/cats that have a hard time being adopted for a reason too. They need it! ❤️❤️",2021-10-06 05:11:46

my cat, Bolt, was 10 years old when we got him - me and my other half wanted a kitten like most people but when we went to the shelter he had been their ""Cat of the Week!"" For two months straight. Didnt regret it a second he was the best friend I ever had

q25ttb,"I was ready to adopt a second dog, and the shelter had a temporary spot in the mall featuring some of their dogs. All were cute, young dogs and I told the worker I was more interested in a dog that was less likely to get adopted. She was like “will you come take a look at this girl?” and brought me to an album of other dogs at the shelter, and there was this mid-sized, black dog that they just couldn’t get adopted. She’d been there longer than any dog ever and there wasn’t a good reason why. I was like yeah, I’ll go over and meet her now. Since I had another dog, I swung by home to pick him up because a greet was required. My other dog was suuuuper chill so I was pretty sure unless she was a psycho, there’d be no issue. There wasn’t, so I was like yeah, for sure, I’ll take her. That’s my girl now. The woman started sobbing. Her name at the shelter was Liza (I renamed her Riley) and when we finished up our paperwork and got ready to leave, the woman got on the speakers and said “attention everyone, Liza is going home. I repeat, Liza is going HOME!” And I could hear screams and cheers from all over the building. She was such a good girl. I lost her to cancer in 2014 but she gave me 6 years first, and she wasn’t young when I got her. I loved my Riley girl. ❤️",2021-10-06 04:35:13

q25ttb,"I have owned 4 rescue dogs and 3 rescue cats, and most all of them were already an adult when they came in to my life. The adult dogs have all been better behaved than the one we got as a puppy, the adult cats better behaved than the kitten with less bad habits such as marking or tearing up furniture. 

I feel like the adult cats were generally calmer and more affectionate- maybe it was because they didnt have the usual zoomies that younger cats often do, or maybe because they knew what it was like to have a harder life and in their own way show their appreciation for receiving a new lease on life.

I like to say that I helped rescue them, but truth be told, they rescued me. They have taught me to be a kinder person and to appreciate how precious life is. 💓",2021-10-05 23:39:54

ud68px,"It really depends on the bird! Even little parakeets need a lot of space and patience. People always get those tiny cages from Petsmart and feed them an all-seed diet, which is wrong, so you really have to do research before getting one. Parakeets can even kill each other if they’re introduced from different flocks too soon. 

Larger parrots like this conure, or much larger ones like macaws and cockatoos need constant attention and enrichment. They’re all different kinds of temperaments too. I’m not an expert, but I remember when my family had both macaws and cockatoos. The macaws were extremely intelligent and knew each of us. The cockatoos too, but they were way more emotional - they could be super sweet and cuddly or extremely nasty lol. Macaws have dangerous bites because of how strong they are, but I’ve been bitten way more by my cockatoos. On top of the space, attention, constant pooping, and special diet, the vet will always be more expensive because you need an exotic vet. 

All this being said, parrot ownership is extremely rewarding. They love you like no other. I have cats now but when I’m older and more financially stable I may consider getting a large parrot again. Anyway, hope I could shed some light ☺️",2022-04-27 23:25:58

ud68px,">”I think I could manage a bird, it doesn’t seem that hard”

Before buying or adopting a bird, make sure you’ve read [this comic](https://cooperscorner.info/?p=19209).

To be frank with you, birds can be amazing little boogers, but they cost a lot (a big proper cage, healthy bird pellets and safe fresh veggies, a constant supply of new bird toys, extra travel cage, vet visits etc), and they are very sensitive and emotionally vulnerable, and many of them will self-harm if they feel anxious or aren’t treated well enough by pulling out their own feathers (“plucking”) and biting their own skin until it bleeds.

They need a lot of attention and love, every single day, and they need to be let out of the cage to fly around indoors and play with you for a substantial amount of time, and they make a lot of noise (some birds like budgies chirp constantly in a never-ending chatter - even in their sleep - and other birds like lovebirds have flock calls that are made to be heard from kilometres away), and you can’t punish them for that or “train it out of them”. It’s just a bird thing.

You can’t count on them being able to sing or talk or like to cuddle or do any of the cute things you see pet birds online do. All birds have very different personalities and abilities, and some will never be able to do what you hope they will do, or want to be close to you or cuddle you, and you need to be aware of that and respect that.

They can destroy things in your home like pulling wall paper off of the wall or chewing up your books or plucking out the buttons of your keyboard or biting through cables or ripping holes in your curtains or biting off chunks of your furniture with their beaks.

Their respiratory systems are extremely fragile, and you need to stop using perfume, hairspray, scented candles and can’t use strong cleaning supplies without moving them to a different part of the house until the airborne chemicals have completely dissipated. You need to throw out all non-stick pans and also some hairdryers or anything else with teflon in it, because the teflon coating of non-stick pans gives off fumes that are lethal to birds. So does the fumes from self-cleaning ovens. The fumes of cooking frying oil is really bad for their lungs as well, and you need to keep them far away from the kitchen so they won’t breathe in any of it. The fumes of self-cleaning ovens can kill them even if they are in a completely different part of the house.

Avocado will kill them within 24 hours because it disrupts their bodies’ ability to transfer oxygen to the cells. Apples are tasty snacks but apple seeds contain enough cyanide to kill them. Some potted plants in your home are poisonous and can be lethal if ingested, and many birds will play and nibble at any plants they find. The soil in plant pots often contain mold spores and can be very dangerous if ingested.

You can never ever open a door or window while the bird is outside of the cage, or they might fly out and then get lost, not being able to find their way back, and die from starvation, thirst, succumb to the elements, or get attacked and killed by a predator. If you want to bring them outside safely you need to get a flight harness for them if you want to be sure they won’t get swooped away by the wind and get lost forever.

You can’t go on a vacation unless you have someone you absolutely 110% trust and who the bird has met before and likes who can care for them while you’re away, and you need to make sure that that person is aware of *all* of these things. 

Also, I would strongly suggest not having a bird and big predator animals like cats or dogs in the same house. Some will say it’s possible, but all it takes is one unsupervised moment or one sudden spooked animal lashing out, and your bird is dead.

They are lovely animals and I would not trade mine for the world, but I’m not going to lie to you and say that they are “easy” animals to care for. They need a lot of love and care and attention and patience and commitment. Please make an informed choice ❤️",2022-06-04 11:01:17

vazbqt,That’s amazing. Cats usually take some time to relax into their new human and home. My first rescue took 6 months to come out form under the couch. She had been returned 4 times because she would disappear and when she showed back up they didn’t want her anymore 😞 I vowed to never do that to her. She lived a long and happy life till she passed away an old lady. This kitty here is impressive! Insta-bond 💜,2022-06-13 03:03:02

vazbqt,I had a black cat just like her.  she was so fond of me... If she knew im in my room she came running to.  she was so cut and her voice was so sweet man! Don't know why she stopped eating..  she didn't want to eat anything..  then one day she never came home.  sometimes i still hope that what if she comes back one day and surprises us.  i know  not gonna happen  if she was alive she would already.  everyone in my house wanted to pet her but she would just come to me. I miss my her. She is gone for almost for 5 months now.  still i feel like she will come back. 😔,2022-06-13 03:29:47

qfq9ds,"Only partially. Pandas are nonsensical. They would have eventually evolved out even without humans having meddled. For example, giant panda mating rituals take weeks but females are only fertile for a few days a year. This makes them incredibly difficult for us to breed even with our scientific knowledge much less... On top of that their babies are born incredibly incredibly small And they cannot take care of two of them. On top of this! It appears that female pandas prefer males who have won a fight for her affection, and in captivity they will often turn away a male presented during her fertile time. 😐

upil5f,"My dog escaped her pen when she was over at my parents house while I was on vacation. She triggered the security alarm and the cops showed up and called my parents at work and they had to drive all the way back home and it was a whole big thing. 

Parents stopped bothering with the pen after that and that’s how my dog transitioned from x-pen to having free rein of their house and my apartment 😂",2022-05-14 18:16:24

upil5f,"😂 just reminds me of my sister’s shih tzu, Layla, when she’s outside she will come running if you have treats, but if she’s into something and you call her name, she won’t even look back. It’s like she suddenly doesn’t know what you’re saying lol. I do agree they’re hard to train when they’re not food oriented",2022-05-14 22:35:44

upil5f,"Omg, you’re so lucky. LOL - our boy is great, super easy. But this little girl. Holy shit, she has us so wrapped around her paws, she even REFUSES TO PEE unless we have a treat ready and waiting. People tell us, well if you just don’t give her treats, she’ll eventually pee. Um, yeah we tried that awhile back. She held her pee for so long, so many times in a row, she gave herself a UTI that resulted in a $200 vet visit and two weeks of antibiotics. So we just stick with the much healthy option of “treat for peepee”. 😂🤣",2022-05-15 20:02:23

gorm9o,RIP Texas ❤️,2020-05-23 00:09:15
gorm9o,Lost ours at 13 and she was such a nose attached to 4 feet! 🥰,2020-05-23 01:08:02
gorm9o,"My old vet (we moved ☹️) loved my dog so much that they would give her free reign of the office. One day when we were going to leave, they were like “okay see you later, you can come pick her up... some other time...” implying I should leave her there.

My last dog was such a little shit and wasn’t as cute as this one. Of course I loved her just as much, but it’s such an ego stroke to have people fawning over your dog...",2020-05-23 03:51:27
gorm9o,"When I brought my kittens to the vet right after I got them they were about 5 weeks old and tiny. The vet asked if we were in a hurry because she wanted to take the kittens into the back so everyone working there could see and cuddle them. We were in no rush so she took them back for like 10 mins or so. My girl cat had trouble pooping the first week so she went back a couple times and everytime they seemed so excited to see her.

They went back pretty frequently the first couple month to get all their vaccinations, but I think they were around 3 months old the last time I took them. They're 7 months old now and already so big. I can't wait for their 1 year old checkup to show the vet how big and good looking they've grown up to be

Edit: There's quite a few pictures of my kittens on my profile. I'm going to have to start calling them cats soon! They're almost not kittens anymore 😿",2020-05-23 01:38:05
gorm9o,They’ll eat themselves to death my vet once told me. Keep a consistent feeding schedule and NO HUMAN FOOD. They are such beggars and mine are too cute to say no sometimes 🥺,2020-05-22 23:35:54
gorm9o,"I think it’s partially just their own personalities. One of mine we can let off leash, no problems. She’ll occasionally push the boundaries but always come back! Our other one just gets on a scent and leaves. Doesn’t always run off, just switches his nose on and his ears off 😂",2020-05-23 01:00:55

vkz7jw,"I used to do this to kids in the hardware store. They’d run in and see our balloons and helium tanks, and start BEGGING their parents for one. Problem is, kids forget they have to hold it, then I spend the rest of the day on a ladder getting it down. So I’d make one then attach a clip and clip it to the back of their clothes and let them hold the ribbon. When they’d forget the ribbon and let go, you’d see the balloon pop up from behind an aisle. Then a lady lost her kid and I pointed out the balloon, and it just became a tradition for the parents with wandering kids to come up front and get a balloon before shopping. 😁",2022-06-26 23:10:32

9x0i3u,I know that feeling. My sister and nephews live in Australia but I can’t even get a tourist visa (it’s been 4 years). Some people at Australian Embassy think that I’ll stay in Sydney forever (not true) . Basically someone can write a refusal letter and tear a family apart. That letter made us realize that the main reason is my race. Sad but true. So I should die and come back to life in another country? A country that they like? I’m sorry but I’m already dead without my family. My baby nephew doesn’t even know me. It breaks my heart. 😔,2018-11-14 23:23:41

There was music and dancing by talented people with marionette puppets, called The Muppets. 

The characters ranged from all walks of life, mainly to encourage kids to grow up to become something other than ‘influencers’, like maybe a Swedish Chef, or a blue, sometimes super, but mostly well balanced dude called Grover. 

But, then they’d cross to the laboratory where two Muppets were undertaking experiments. There was Professor Bunsen, and his wild-eyed, crazy orange-haired assistant, Beaker. 

Hilarity ensued.

xf1ge5,"He would indeed snuggle all night! For his whole life he always wanted to sleep with me at night. On the occasions I wasn’t home at night, he’d wander around looking for me and shouting.

He had so many different vocalizations that I always knew what he wanted and how he was feeling from them. One of the chattiest cats I ever was around

xf1ge5,"Hah yeah, my wife, I, and our housemate have a cat who’s name gets reactions like that.

Our housemate and I have very similar tastes, and as the three of us were discussing names for cats, it turned out we both were huge fans of the same sci-do work with the same favorite character, and that turned out to be the cat’s name.

It has a super short form, a short form, and a complete form… we usually use the super short form which sounds pretty normal, and it gets increasingly weird from there - usually to the result of bemusement from others 🤣

Her super short form name is “Misty”

The longer form is “Mistake Not”

And her full name is “Mistake Not My Current State Of Joshing Gentle Peevishness For The Awesome And Terrible Majesty Of The Towering Seas Of Ire That Are Themselves The Mere Milquetoast Shallows Fringing My Vast Oceans Of Wrath”

Which I maintain is an excellent name for a Tiny Violence",2022-09-16 15:30:10

pv9v0u,"Yes they are so different! My oldest kitty is a sweetheart but when he is mad he gets petty and passive aggressive. We taught him to stop waking us up to eat, so he started playing with his toys SUPER LOUD and bring them in the bed.

We ignored him or kicked him out which backfired for him. So his next and current tactic is to aggressively show us affection. I mean he becomes your shadow, gives the big eyes, snuggles your feet and neck. Just dirty moves. I still don't cave till his time, and a part of me loves it because they are the best. He probably thinks its the secret to getting fed on time lol.

His next petty thing is he pretends he can't hear me sometimes when I call but his ears perk slightly, but when my bf does he looks over. And he tries his darnednest to not look at my face. Ultimate petty.

He is super sweet, way chill at 3, and an F6 Savannah that looks like Domestic Shorthair. He loves humans, hates other animals.

Now my new kitten? that 5 month demon is a black cat who will YELL not meow, ONLY YELLS for food, cuddles, attention. He has to get it from all 3 of us or he gets angry and runs around yelling mad. Me, my bf, and his older cat bro all better give him rubs or attention. He is LOUD. All the time. When I got him I told my bf I need to keep talking and laughing normally so he isn't scared (I laugh and talk loud when happy. I also make random squaking bird sound effects at home when looking for stuff. Weird I know, but I needed to prep him. My older cat doesn't even flinch if I yell now)

My bf thinks I talked so much and was loud on purpose so much I made our cat a loud yelly boy 😭. He used to be even ruder though! He used to jumps on our chests and bend down to yell in bf *ear* for food to wake up. We are training him out of that though. He  at least doesn't do it to me anymore because once at 4 months I started weaning off the kitten enabling behavior. A little later than normal but he was a bright spot after my surgery so he's definitely spoiled by all of us so if he's still transitioning out of being rotten, it is on us. But still a sweetheart.

I've had many cats growing up and they have so much personality. And cats pick up and respond to owner behavior more than people realize. Both our cats act like a combination of us. The good and bad.",2021-09-25 21:16:20

It’s far more frustrating (and expensive. and painful) to not produce them normally.

hllmcj,Aww. What a beautiful story.  Im so glad they found each other.  🥰,2020-07-05 14:43:09
hllmcj,So cute! 😍😊,2020-07-05 17:05:18
hllmcj,Omgash.. this warms my heart.. sssoo much. 🥰❤❤❤,2020-07-05 17:20:24

hllmcj,"How great that these two can be 
together again. !!!! 🧡🧡🧡🧡",2020-07-05 17:57:09
hllmcj,James Herriott wrote a story similar to this - a kids short - and I love it. Close to tears every time. One of the dogs never barked in its life but when he saw his brother again he let out one woof. 😭,2020-07-05 18:01:54
hllmcj,Soooo adorable 😍,2020-07-05 18:06:10

hllmcj,"I’m in Sydney, Australia. But there are so many people with similar dogs posting here, you might find one near you that’s a sibling 😊",2020-07-05 22:46:58
hllmcj,"I figured it was relevant, since most breeders here keep information about where their dogs go, and give them opportunities to stay in touch with their littermates. 

My girl didn’t have that chance, but it still happened 😊",2020-07-05 22:51:12
hllmcj,"Seeing this kind of comment a lot, so figured I’d address it. 

I rarely post on Reddit, but have started contributing to subs that make me happy (the only ones I follow). I re-discovered this pic scrolling through my photo album, it made me smile again, and figured it was a nice story to share. 

Clearly, based on the comments here alone, it’s a common one! 😊

I’ve got no reason to be misleading here, I even use my real name 😂",2020-07-05 23:01:28
hllmcj,Is that called family reunion? It’s not a play date. Get it right please 😂,2020-07-05 18:12:18
hllmcj,Yeah. The we’re separated after 8 weeks like the post title covered 😂😂,2020-07-05 13:22:15

7pww35,"I have a cat now that we found as a kitten so he grew up around my dog. He loves the dog so much and the dog is not the biggest fan (he doesn’t like that the attention is shared). Cat greets dog with the twitchy tail and a meow and rub on his legs and try to reach up to rub on his face. The whole time dog is like 😐 When he was a kitten he was always trying to get dog to play and dog was not having it, he’d do a grumpy grr and chase cat off.

Really is the most chipper cat I’ve ever met, he never gets grumpy. Dog is just lazy and sort of weird. I was sad they aren’t better friends like my lab and kitten from childhood, cat is really trying.",2018-01-12 18:34:54

7la40m,The Conjuring 2 isn't half bad either. A little girl slowly transforming in an old man (all out of focus) and stuff with a creepy painting was disconcerting in a good way. I wonder if they're working on 3. 🤔 *edit* Status: Announced ,2017-12-21 20:18:31

o7rjnl,"Be good to cows, dont eat the cows! They have personalities, they love their babies, they are playful and enjoy pets and scratches! They are just big doggos 😁 

I will leave you guys who found this video cute and wholesome some food for thought: Would you ever kill a cow with your own hands to eat it instead of paying someone to do it for you? I know there are a lot of people out there who would, but Im addressing you who actually love animals, but for some reason also eat them.

Cmon guys, at least consider the idea. Cheers",2021-06-26 01:36:12

o7rjnl,"I think some farmers have said that dairy cows just don’t mother their calves that often. Some will lay down and smush them and not really care. Others will abandon them in fields and not care. I don’t know much besides that, and I don’t really contribute to dairy production since I can’t drink or eat the products without pain so i don’t feel the need to prove or deny that to supper why I don’t buy milk. There’s a few farmers on TikTok that will call out the mythos that dairy cows are great mothers because it’s a natural instinct and they have cows on property that would be dead had they not found them after birth because mom just didn’t care. 🤷🏼‍♀️",2021-06-26 13:14:05
o7rjnl,"Yeah, the dairy industry is worse than the meat industry in a lot of ways sadly. It’s easier to just not think about this shit. Cows look happy with their scratching pole, don’t get me wrong. But their lives are far from happy.

Its the type of dog I would want if I got one, growing up we had pits and they were by far the best dogs ever, they only get a bad reputation because they really want to please their owners and will do nearly anything for them, hence why most end up in illegal dog fights....they are just trying to please their masters....otherwise they wouldn't hurt a fly unless someone tried to hurt their family members, then watch the f*ck out!!!",2021-02-27 18:03:59

Now he gets rashes only when the cat's nails break the skin (sometimes they get too excited when they climb on him, they're not violent). I've had cats all my life, these are his first. These cats ADORE him, don't care much about me. I wouldn't have it any other way! He loves it ♥️",2021-02-27 19:30:11

ltlhrx,I know we definitely did! We were always *super* grateful for anything like that. This was pre-covid though so perhaps call a few shelters and ask if they would need any donations like that. Thank you for your kindness! ❤,2021-02-27 21:45:41

jo2upu,"When my parents divorced and I moved out, from a full house it went to 2 people not being there for most of the day. We made up for it by giving her lots of attention and spoiling her like crazy when we were there and she seemed ok, then my sister got a cat. When she went to move out a week later, she couldn’t take the cat because it preferred staying with the dog so essentially it seems like we got my dog a cat 🤷‍♀️",2020-11-05 11:49:22
jo2upu,That’s what happened to us. Our dog died and we finally started looking at new ones. The next week we stopped looking because we found out we were having a baby. I swear next week we found two abandoned baby kittens a couple days old in our backyard. The best thing to happen besides my kids. Well that last sentence depends on the day. 😂 JK,2020-11-04 22:46:57

And 3 cram into the xl kennel and literally sleep on top of each other 🙄",2019-06-18 03:20:53

c1r7x7,"My dog has no chill. I have a queen bed and sleep alone, but he refuses to sleep next to me, at my feet, really anywhere near me unless he can be right on top of me. And if I stop petting him for a second he licks my mouth (I love him but ew) to remind me of my responsibility to never stop petting him.

rtbk1l,"Aww 

I am sure they notice your efforts!


Something I've noticed is they are very watchful and they hear my every move, even when I'm in the house. 

So when you see them , try making eye contact ..I  even nod sometimes and they respond to that.

Also if you like their crowing, try humming a pleasant tone at them in response. They seem to really like this sort of attention.

I never fed birds before so I can't comment on that though.

Wishing you luck and lmk how you go!🤞",2022-01-01 16:48:14

qm9wd1,"I've fostered a ton and have ended up with mama/baby pairs long term before and I will say it really depends on personality. I still have one mama and her 4 year old baby (now twice her size) and she doesn't like him LOL. She loves our other cat, is pretty snuggly and groomy with him, but hisses when her son gets within a foot of her and has since he was weaned. Her son is quite a bit more of a rough player, though he is friends with the third cat, too, and I think he is just big enough that mama wanted him out of her space ASAP 😂 mama had been pretty ill and a stray when she had her kittens and at least one of the kittens died, so I wonder if she didn't really bond with them as strongly.

We have another foster pair that is mama/daughter, maybe one year younger, and they are a LOT more bonded. Mama doesn't get along with other cats often but mama and daughter spoon and cuddle constantly. It is very clear they are bonded well. If I could pick the perfect adopters, they would both go together at this point. Unfortunately even on their own there has been almost 0 interest since both are shy about strangers and over 2 years old, but they are quite happy at my house in the meantime.

What is interesting is with that last pair, the daughter had been adopted out previously as a young kitten and then returned after she was over a year old. Mama never left here. They re-bonded after baby returned in a matter of days and are more strongly bonded now than before.",2021-11-04 13:03:39

oalwvm,"Oh my heart. I had a rescue duckling a few years ago and we were sitting by the pond (I was sitting, he was having a paddle around) and he kept looking over to me like he was trying to tell me something. 

At that moment I realised, he’d fully imprinted on me as his momma and was waiting for me to join him in swimming. So, like any reasonable human, I immediately stripped off down to my shorts and jumped in the pond with him! 😂

We were there for a good couple of hours splashing around and playing. We played ‘hide and seek’ too, I’d dive under the water for a few seconds and swim away a little, as soon as I was back up he’d be furiously paddling his little feet to get over to me.🥺

He ended up climbing up onto my shoulder once he was tired and fell asleep in the sun. Some of my best memories are with him.",2021-06-30 12:15:35

g47o3j,"Omg 🥺ok let’s see...if/when it comes up to me next, do you think it would let me pet it? I don’t wanna move too fast but I’m feeling brave now lol...also how and where do cats like to be pet? I have 3 dogs but that’s different I assume

EDIT: thank you all so so much for the wonderful advice!! I’ll have to keep my peepers peeled for The Cat the next time I’m out for a walk🥰",2020-04-19 17:36:05
g47o3j,"The tops of their heads, cheeks and shoulders are perfectly safe places to pet. Places that are more touchy is the lower back. I’d avoid the belly unless they roll over and show it. 

When you get the head butting, it’s a perfect time to scratch their head! 😁

Another thing about cat language - slow repeated blinking is “I love you” 🥰",2020-04-19 17:41:15
g47o3j,"Haha naw I understand people aren't into cats as much as dogs, heck id love to own a dog, but I grew up more with cats, maybe one day! It'll have to be hypoallergenic since me and my bf tend to get allergies from animals that aren't hypo😩",2020-04-19 23:27:49
g47o3j,This is my go to. He sees the bottle chilling next to where ever he isn’t supposed to go and it usually effectively keeps him away. Until he feels brave.... then he gets to be reminded of what’s inside the bottle 😂,2020-04-19 17:06:28
g47o3j,The only thing that stinks about a cat is the litter box which when cleaned properly doesn’t stink. My cat only annoys me when he wants his food. He just chills wherever I am and when I talk to him he talks back ❤️ I love my kitty,2020-04-19 16:41:58

10jc12g,"I am not a vet, but have a large breed deep chested dog (I’m told they are more prone to Bloat aka GDV) and two different veterinarians have mentioned there was a study in the 90s that concluded that raised bowls were generally not beneficial.  

 And the study said that the large dogs (deep chested ones in particular) with raised bowls had an increased potential for developing that problem.     
iirc, it has to do with trapping excess air in their belly. Especially if they’re aggressive/fast eaters.   
This is anecdotal and I would ask your veterinary professional for their advice if you’re concerned.      
My ~15yo old Dane mutt has no problems eating food or drinking water from bowls on the floor. If there’s an issue at some point I may consider raising them up a bit, because “quality” of life choices happen with elder dogs at some point, but we ain’t there yet. :)

10jc12g,"Mine refuses to eat out of raised bowls, even slightly raised, has to be on the floor so he can eat laying down.  If it’s raised, he just grabs a mouthful and walks to the other side of the kitchen, dumps it out of his mouth, lays down and eats. I gave up because I was tired of stepping on them. He knows what he likes 🤷🏻‍♀️",2023-01-23 21:53:44
10jc12g,"Ahh I seee, that's definitely one way of looking at it. When I was younger I would definitely agree, even with humans I thought we had ""lost causes"" and should just focus resources like why even let people with glasses breed(I have glasses) if we stopp3d them from breeding everyone would have good eyesight eventually. But as I've grown older though I've grown soft and now see it as our job to save them. I can no longer make the decision to just sacrifice them. I would want to breed them to have pugs that have longer snouts so they can breathe or corsos with short ears that don't need to be cropped. But it's a lot more difficult and thankfully I'm not the one that has to make this decision on scale 😅",2023-01-23 18:20:05

p90wx5,That right there is a simp limp!!! 😆,2021-08-22 01:50:55
p90wx5,"It's already explained behaviorally by the way dogs like to copy their people's movements, but I cant help but wonder if this kind of injury mirroring could also be a ""protect the pack"" behavior? To make it harder for any potential predators to visually pick out the more vulnerable target to go after, protecting the weakened one? 

Just a thought, but if there happens to be footage of any pack bonded canine group all fake-limping around their packmate with a real limp, I need to see 😍 

Would be especially interesting in non domesticated canids. 

Or was imitation behavior something that came from early domestication of dogs, seen as friendly by humans and perhaps selectively bred for, like other more communicative traits like more eyebrow muscles?

but better feet you'll never see

two furry legs, with paws below

they'll bring a smile to you, i know

the pitter pat of paws so sweet -

you humans falling

at my feet!

116f3qc,"I agree, there is no excuse for putting an animal through unnecessary pain. But what about people with allergies?

My sister has a rescue and finds stray dogs (usually in really bad shape) or gets them from that months kill list at the shelter and finds homes for them. Basically she is an animal saint.

Her and her kids however are very allergic to cats.  They opted to purchase 2 Devon Rex cats from a really great breeder (who they kept in touch with for the first few years) and have lived happily for 14 years. 

She will occasionally rescue litters & help people get their cats spayed neutered, but they have to stay in her garage till they go to another foster. 

I guess what I’m saying is, it’s nuanced. Her owning those cats, didn’t take anything away from other cats. My sister just wouldn’t have gotten cats if that breed wasn’t available.

It’s possible that the cat rescues she does make, in spite of her allergies, is thanks to the bond she now has with her own cats. 

PS. She actually found a stray who got hit my a car and worked her butt off getting him treated until I could fly down and take him. That little one eyed Raspurrtin is now my baby! 🥰",2023-02-20 15:33:03

xmqfhg,"To an outsider definitely but for me they are almost more unique than a name when it comes to animals born here. Because they go in sequence I can get a good idea of an animals age just from their tag if they are born here, and I can tell who their father is! Like our early 700s were born October 2020, with all but 1 hereford off of Rocky and all anguses off of Nick. But I get if others don’t understand what I mean.

gqivm2,"When I was 11 I had a cat that would sleep under the covers with me like this. We found the litter abandoned on the side of the road in Portugal, and we took them home and looked after them. 5 altogether, we kept 2 of them. He was my best friend, loved being carried around and cuddled.

Eventually we had to move back to Scotland, and we didn't want to bring them back because they were used to roaming the Portuguese countryside, so we left them with our friends 

The day we left, I said my goodbyes to him, crying obviously, and got in the car. A few minutes later just as we're about to leave, we hear a little meow, and look back to see them both perched on the back seats waiting expectantly to come with us, like they had for years.

GUYS. As a 12 year old boy, getting out that car to put him back on the wall was THE hardest thing emotionally I've ever had to do. I love you Sandy, I hope you're a happy boy wherever you are ♥️",2020-05-31 12:25:56

You replied:

> I’d love someone to do an ELI5 on why dogs do this! 

So that's what I was responding to. 

My dog also does the crazy dance sometimes when she's really excited. We didn't teach her, but we do encourage it! Sometimes it's when she's trying to 'tempt' my cats into playing with her. It never works, though. They just run away.

i3kyk9,"Sweet! This brings me to this cat and her name is Lizzie. She was in a sheriff’s lost and stray cat shelter. Lizzie just lost 3 kittens and she was terrified of everyone. I got a call about her and came out to meet her. I noticed everyone was wary, yet one staff opened the cage. I took her out and she went into a fetal position in my arms. Broke my heart. I spoke and held her gently. She looked at me with her big eyes the BAM!!!! She slapped her paw and one of her poked into my forehead between my eyes. The blood flowed down my nose and face. Everyone froze, inside what I was going to do. I continued to hold her and said it’s ok. One staff said, maybe it’s a mistake.... I said no, she’s coming home with me. The staff blubbered, “But she put in a claw hole on you...” I nodded, “Yes, it’s her way of giving me a stamp of approval.” I was being a bit of an a-home, because I got frustrated how people gave up on certain cats when they did something out of fears. They were pretty stunned I would bring her into my rescue. She’s still with me now 15 years later, sharing my pillows. She is a professional sock juggler. Every cat deserves a chance. ❤️",2020-08-30 21:50:58

i3kyk9,Back when I was in college I would go to the shelter at least once a week. I couldn't have a pet in the dorms and was very sad about it so I'd go visit the animals and give them lots of pets and attention.

I have brought it up to 4 different vets. None of them are concerned, they say some cats just do that. I have a system that works for me—I give them bits of wet food in the morning until she has chilled out and then fill the rest of their dry food completely up, and they’re free fed otherwise. For whatever reason if she’s not already full she loves going ham on the fresh kibble until she pukes.

They are perfectly healthy weight, she isn’t eating too much she is just eating too fast at once.

And “takes 2-3 days to eat a whole bowl” means nothing to me lol. Your bowl could be a dog bowl for all I know.",2020-11-13 19:32:20

b06wjn,"I have a similar story from a while back 😅 

&#x200B;

When I was about 5 or so, we had just moved to a new house. At the time, we had a handful of cats and one dog, KC. A little after we moved, my dad was worried that KC was going to get lonely since I and my sisters would be at school, my parents at work, and she had no one else to really play with. So, my dad asked my mom to go out and adopt *one* new puppy. 

And my mom, being my mom, came back with *three:* two rottweiler/lab puppies and a 2 year-old german shepherd mix. Well, my dad couldn't be upset for too long because he loved dogs anyway, and me and my sisters were ecstatic. 

&#x200B;

Sadly over the years, we lost KC and one of the pups (Milo, who was about 10 or 11 when he passed), but we still have the another one (Louie) and the shepherd (Max).",2019-03-12 16:22:33

b06wjn,"My mum, as a kid, had a cat who would always go missing. It was soon worked out that kitty always turned up at the neighbours' house down the road. After several incidents and attempts to keep the cat home, mum, her parents and the The Chosen neighbours worked out the cat just preferred to live at the neighbours'. 

So it was formally decided that the neighbours had been adopted and the cat would continue to live with them, not that the new caregivers minded one bit. Mum still went over to visit, of course 🙃",2019-03-12 19:38:03

r2rbfs,"Microwaves only have one power level. Lowering the ""power"" on a microwave oven actually imposes a duty cycle, which turns the magnetron on and off automatically over the specified duration. Different ovens determine the time share in different ways. 

My cheap micro at home will split 30 seconds at 50% power is ""full power for 15 seconds, then just spin the food for 15 seconds."" 🤦‍♂️

A better microwave might go full power for 8 seconds, off for 14, then full power for 8 seconds.

They don't just alternate power cycling the magnetron on a second on/second off basis. Maybe that's hard on the magnetron? 

Anyways, power settings on microwaves tend to be more useful for longer duration things. (Like I'll nuke a hot pocket or burrito for 4 minutes at 50% and get it more evenly heated than if I cook it at 100% for 2 minutes) The delay time between being nuked allows for the heat to spread via conduction to the 'cold' parts of the food.

edit: This is applicable to a standard microwave. Apparently there are new *true variable power* units.",2021-11-26 23:39:26

72zuvc,My dog was fine. He has been swimming since he was at least 4 months old. He loves being in our pool so much that I was able to train him to dive off the board. He actually discovered that this is his way to stay in the pool without being exhausted. Thanks for the concern though. 😁😁,2017-09-29 02:46:56
72zuvc,"This dog is not one of them then. He's my dog, so I know very well that he was not scared. He does that on his own all the time whenever he feels like it. He has been swimming since he was a pup, and he loves our pool so much that I was able to train him with pool tricks such as jumping off the board on command. I was just splashing the pool water when he decided to stand up, so I filmed him. I never trained him to do this. He just did it on his own. 😁",2017-09-29 02:53:34

10ihdpc,"Yeah, I was extremely slow with it, and I know I got lucky. I still keep them separate when I’m at the barn or out with friends, but luckily working from home means I can generally keep an eye on them and shut down any nonsense.

10ihdpc,Your black lab sounds extremely different to the black labs we had 😅. They never got hold of our smaller pets but if they had done it's pretty safe to say they would have been a tasty snack and not brought to us!,2023-01-22 19:18:57

My dog is cool with dogs but she was betrayed for a few days when my ex brought home the senior he adopted. She was [not thrilled](https://imgur.com/2kvhJfK) to share attention, but she got [over it](https://imgur.com/a/LXHSc) 😂

It's been like 5 years and Cloris still drops by...even after their own cat passed away they still keep food around for Cloris. Turns out Cloris' real name is Shoots. They suspect he has several homes.

Cloris was also seen chasing a coyote down the street one night. Cloris is a real badass.

10uc7zk,">Not really true. 

>Cats are naturally outside animals, some have just been domesticated more than others.

This is true. My friend rescued a street cat who was pretty feral (despite only being about 6 to 9 months old). This cat could NOT be kept inside, even after neutering. 

He would jump on people's back as they were going out the door and even went as far as to squeeze himself between a window pane and a screen to try to get out. He was distraught to be kept in. My friend knew that keeping his cat in was the most responsible thing to do, but that cat WOULD. NOT. HAVE  IT.

Sometimes we don't have a choice. 🤷‍♀️",2023-02-05 22:12:09

pkj3pk,"Similar thing happened with me and my pillows. My grandma gifted me some pillows when I was a baby and they were really really soft, but they'd always be in a pillow case so I'd spend nights trying to rip open the pillow cases to get my hands on the soft pillows. Must've ripped open half a dozen or so before my grandma figured it out so she started to put them in those button cases instead. I'd fish around for the holes as I was falling asleep and it'd be lights out the second I felt the softness. Cue me at nearly 20 and I still can't get rid of those pillows. I still only use button cases and I still fish for the hole. It's no longer lights out due to bad insomnia but it's still comforting. I dread the day I have to get rid of them because they're too nice.

Also kind of a bonus bit: there were 6 pillows as a set. I'd received 2 of them and only 1 of them was the real soft™. The other one was soft too but not as much as the other one. One time my grandma tried to wean me off the pillows or maybe my brother wanted to trade but didn't wanna ask me, I'm not sure what it was but I remember being about 10 and neither pillow was the soft. They were soft, but not my soft. So I flipped the whole house upside down trying to find my soft and finally found it in my brother's bed who was sleeping. Ripped those things right from under him and took back my soft. You don't take away my soft and get away with it no siree.",2021-09-09 07:32:57

pkj3pk,"LoL as much as it should sound horrible...  It truly is bliss ❤️

I've always been a single mom so I co-slept.  Made it easier to nurse, easier to get her back to sleep if she woke up with bad dreams or got up for any other reason.  

She's always been a Very Active sleeper.    I'd wake up and she'd be laying across the bed sideways or diagonally with a foot in my neck and her stuffed animals right up in my face... or multiple slaps in my face and chest as she tossed and turned about... a random finger in my nose or her chubby little arm across my face so I couldn't breathe... .  Plastering her adorable little furnace blasting body to my side, because she needed a cuddle,   me scooting over to extricate myself so I could breathe a bit and ending up on the very last 1/2 inch edge of mattress or her rolling herself up into the blanket so I'm left with none....

Hell,  she is 15 now and when she has nightmares or is sick she will still climb into bed next to me.    She takes up all the room, steals my blankets  and kicks me all night but damn if I don't cherish every second of that love and vulnerability.    

She will be a fully grown human, ready to strike out on her own, wanting to prove she doesn't need anyone and that she ""can do it herself"" (as she's  said since she was 3) all to soon...  So, every moment that she still allows me to mother her, take care of her and love on her is a precious gift that I am so thankful for.    No matter how many painful kicks to the kidney or mom balancing on the edge of the mattress with no blanket nights there are left.... If she needs me,  i'll pull back the covers, cuddle her and take it with a smile on my face and so much happiness and love in my 💜.",2021-09-09 06:50:16

v0w0wl,"As per instinct, a cat won't like getting their nails done, of course there's the odd one out.
^truth with modifications

Because if you'll have a cat from newborn, you can easily teach it to not minding getting it's nails clipped. At the earliest stage, there's naturally no need to do it, but if you just play with its paws and make the nails detract, it get used to it.

Good job on teaching him to relax in the situation with treats ❤️

9fr8cc,">t was an accident..Puffie got chocked when we were not home.. I will never forget the feeling when I knew that there's no chance to bring him back to me anymore...I know you guys miss Puffie so much, so am I. We were watching him grow up day by day..can't wait to wake up every morning to see him walk to his breakfast with the sleepy face..can't wait for the moment when we got home and opened door, he will surely run to us with that happy face. And take nap with him with his noisy snore...it's heartbreaking..But we still hope that everyone can go on with life and don't feel sad for Puffie anymore. Puffie love to see us smile. Even he is not here now, but he will still stay in our heart forever ❤️",2018-09-14 17:04:12

854p6x,"she got me one female one that i didn't want or ask for to ""make me feel better"" about the loss of my hamster. and it turned out to be female and already pregnant. honest mistake?? but *then* she took in two more male ones because someone she knew didn't want their (highly aggressive) guinea pigs anymore, and ""my daughter loves guinea pigs, she already has three!"" 🙄

my room was overtaken by massive cages (they all had to be kept separate or would fight to kill) and the constant stench and noise of guinea pigs. i spent so much time cleaning it all, but the stench never went away. i would never keep guinea pigs again! they were very cute but we never bonded and i just felt bad for them.",2018-03-18 11:38:54

11g2xcm,"Thank you for the support!!! Carols Mencia is a comedic inspiration of mine. The way he contorts his mouth into the shape of an anal voidhole and then spews ""DEEE DEEEE DEEEEE"" is the pinnacle of all joke deliveries. If you'd ever like to meet up for a bowl of spaghettios it's on me, we can continue to discuss my amazing comedic achievements and who they compare to. I'll even spring for extra grundlemeat chunks since you seem a little cranky 😎😎😎",2023-03-02 19:55:33
11g2xcm,"Yes exactly. If you want a pure breed cat that’s not sprayed you have to pay like double the price for it. 💸The reason why is because you are now competition with the original breeders with breeding kittens or even at cat shows. 
My girl was half the price as I just wanted her as a pet and nothing more. 😊",2023-03-02 18:58:15

ahald0,Canine 😂 the breed is a malamute though.,2019-01-19 06:45:25
ahald0,"Yeah I wouldn't have commented if it were an open truck, at least that part of the car isn't made to get beat up in an accident 🤷‍♀️ it's about risk versus reward, a dog in the trunk is SO high risk for no reward. ",2019-01-18 15:23:26
ahald0,"I agree, you have good points, but being restrained by a harness in the back seat of a vehicle which is reinforced is safer than the trunk. And honestly it just comes across in this video that they do this because of their perfect white leather seats. It just seems like a dick thing to do to a dog. But that’s just my view. That’s all. ☺️",2019-01-18 20:53:43
ahald0,😂 brain fart,2019-01-20 18:40:36

ahald0,I have a Cane Corso/Bullmastiff cross who has loose lips lol We bought our car purely for the functionality of it. So I hear you 😂 But about Lyft/Uber... omg has no one been educated about discrimination and the right to not be refused service based on a disability? That is maddening.

surrounded in smells of their breath and their wiggles,

buried in puppies will give you the giggles!

more puppies together than one man can hold,

he's buried so deep in a true pot of gold!

as momma looks on n approves of this friend

his happiness shows in his smile, end to end :)

truly a dream for this pup loving fellow,

he surely must know

some of that 'gold'

is *yellow*...

dfgz2r,What else do they know 🤔,2019-10-09 19:12:09
dfgz2r,"So true. A buddy of mine had his lunch in a plastic sack, those deer kept mopping at the sack as he walked by until it tore open 😂

That temple was pretty badass though. I just remember how huge it was when looking across the courtyard.",2019-10-09 20:22:50

My family had 1 and the first day we brought him home he ate 13 heads of romaine, about a consistent 8-9 more a day until he unfortunately passed. I just hope man doesn't go broke buying lettuce. 🙏

They’ve had the CRex kittens for three months and so far his allergies are mostly not acting up. They can sit in his lap or shoulder for hours and he’s fine, the only issue is if he rubs his eyes or nose after holding them without washing his hands. Even if he does touch his face w/o washing the reaction is still less severe than with their previous cat. Hope you get to have your own kitty soon! 💕🐈",2021-11-18 18:35:59

Like, yes, in the wild they [would be cleaned by other creatures](https://oceanbites.org/how-to-clean-a-sea-turtle/) in a symbiotic relationship, and in captivity they can, over time, get dirty and need help being cleaned since it isn't happening naturally... but these turtles are not dirty. And they wouldn't need to be wiping the head and flippers like that. Or focusing on an obviously clean plastron (bottom shell)... they'd be focusing most of their energy on the carapace (top shell).This looks unnecessary and mostly for the camera... because ""aww"". Given that... i don't think they really care about it being safe to touch them... 
Though, even if they were it wouldn't matter... there is no ""making yourself safer to touch them""  
  
It's not exactly that the bacteria on your skin can hurt them - it's that touching them can essentially poke a hole in their anti-bacterial armor.  

> Many animals, including turtles, rays and many species of sharks, can become vulnerable to harmful bacteria through human contact, leaving them susceptible to disease. These creatures rely on bio-films (a kind of protective slime) to keep out infection, which we can compromise through touch.  

So touching them in general disturbs the biofilm. Not to mention, it can cause stress, which weakens their immune system. That's where a lot of the harm comes from and part of why there's laws prohibiting even just touching them (harassing or causing harm).  

So I'm inclined to think these people are either just ""aww""-farming... or genuinely don't know. Neither option is attractive. But what do I know, I just mod r/turtle 😅😂🤷‍♂️🙃",2023-02-27 07:56:04

We don't call adopted kids ""rescues"" and we don't constantly say things like ""look how my ADOPTED son looks at me"" bc whether or not the being is adopted/""rescued"" has nothing to do with the quality of the stare 🤷 (PS go watch Bill Burr's take on us using the word ""rescue"" for dogs, it's funny)",2022-12-31 23:11:38

ux5oyf,Same thought 😂,2022-05-25 03:50:14
ux5oyf,"One hypothesis suggests it was for mating/fighting purposes.  

Basically male giraffes fight each other for women by using their heads like a morning star (spiky ball on a chain).  They have sharp horns on their very hard heads and they swing their heads at their opponents to hurt them.  The longer the neck is, the less you get hit and the more momentum you can build for your blows.

This article on Wired has wwwaaayyy more information on giraffe necks then I ever thought I would need to read 😆: https://www.wired.co.uk/article/why-do-giraffes-have-long-necks",2022-05-25 11:37:02

He said we could consider it if our future children really really want a pet though, once they're old enough to handle one with respect.

Snow Leopards are also about double the size of the average Leopard, Leopards typically weigh about 60/70 kg top end whereas Snow Leopards weigh between 60 and 120 kg!

I usually don't reply to 'challenge' online, as I look at details enough myself. But in this case I saw it like the saying, ""Can't see the forest for the trees"".

Constant disconnection can breed apathy, lack of compassion or empathy, etc. A cuddle puppy is a great idea. I personally had ferrets. They are a riot, but always wished they were bigger. If my Rascal was the size of the Giant River Otter (5ft long, 100lbs!), my world would be a better place! Lol😊",2023-01-04 14:43:03

uex3x5,What a sweet little old lady 💗. I have a rabbit who is 11 years old and the fur around her whiskers and ears have gone grey and white.,2022-04-30 09:11:50
uex3x5,She is aging gracefully! Still gorgeous 😍,2022-04-30 14:17:05
uex3x5,My girl passed last January at age 20. Enjoy those sweet old lady kitty snuggles; it's such a gift to have them for so long. Very happy for you both. 💜,2022-04-30 16:06:16
uex3x5,Awwww sweet old grumpy kitty 🙂,2022-04-30 16:49:00
uex3x5,I mean it fits! 😉,2022-04-30 00:17:53
uex3x5,We are their whole lives to them and they are everything to us. ♥,2022-04-30 03:53:12
uex3x5,OP said she’s 17 in another comment 🥰,2022-04-30 03:31:30
uex3x5,I actually have a super up close photo of her face and it's like a galaxy. It's so pretty ♥,2022-04-30 01:44:55
uex3x5,Aw ♥. Black Kitty hates everyone except me. She's a major grump as my vet says. She's on medication now and she was a complete demon to everyone there at the office. He told me he has no idea how I'll be able to give it to her but to try my best. She just let's me give it to her because she's a big sweetie to me. It's like night and day.,2022-04-30 01:24:48
uex3x5,I say the same thing! I love taking up close pictures of her because the grey really does look like brush strokes and it's more popping. She has speckles here and there and she is just a pretty picture ♥,2022-04-30 16:18:58
uex3x5,I thought she popped her head in a bag of flour then I read the text 😂,2022-04-30 03:34:22
uex3x5,I also had a precious baby named Black Kitty and yours is the first I’ve seen apart from my girl with the name. I called her that bc she used to be so skittish I thought she’d never let me get close to her. Fast forward a few years and she became the cuddliest kitty ever and the descriptor name she got “stuck” with took on a super cute endearing quality imo ❤️,2022-04-30 03:45:54
uex3x5,"I just love the white mask on her! 🤍.  And that she hates the world of ppl, except you.  Enjoy your life together.  Sneak in an extra pet & scratch from me. ♥️",2022-04-30 09:19:40
uex3x5,"Sounds kind of like my cat. She's feral, according to the person who sold her to me. Very afraid of other people and has battered a few vet techs, but she's so sweet to me. I have to give her injections multiple times per week and she has opinions about it but doesn't fight. Just complains. Also she's a major cuddle bug and i have a giant pillow because she insists on sleeping next to my head. I guess she's more trusting of me because i've had her for a long time (over 14 years, since we were both little). We're definitely a bonded pair 💕    

Also your cat is so cute and unique looking. I've never seen a cat grow so much white fur with age, she looks like an adorable coke fiend lmao.",2022-04-30 10:58:17
uex3x5,I’m so sorry. They are our Family. Bless you. ❤️,2022-05-01 01:22:09
uex3x5,Aw precious baby looks like caramel icecream ♥,2022-04-30 03:26:05
uex3x5,"When I had to get her dental checkups when she was younger they had to put her in The Box™ to spray some relaxer in there to make her more tolerable. I would hear nurses say ""Nope I'm done, I tried."" A door open and close and ""RrRRrRRrRRr HISSsSss"" Then one would come back and ask me to pick her up and put her in The Box™. Black Kitty had no issue letting me touch her, it was like magic to them, haha.",2022-04-30 03:40:33
uex3x5,Awww 😆😭❤️,2022-05-01 16:40:29
uex3x5,Lub her 😽😽😽😽😽😽😽😽,2022-04-30 03:47:50
uex3x5,Cats are so funny. They're totally cool with one person and a demon with everyone else. The only animal that we can tolerate those types of behaviors from 😅 I love it. I hope you and your cat are very happy (or as content as cats can be) together!,2022-04-30 05:29:58
uex3x5,"Aww thanks. Yes, it’s all about the kitties in this house. I know my place 😆

I’d do it all over again in a second. ❤️ She’s been a pure joy.",2022-05-01 16:19:36
uex3x5,"Yes, at first they wanted her to get it during her checkups but I researched the heck out of the condition online (and reading Tanya's guide) and called to inquire if they would teach me so I could give it to her at home. She is insanely mean at the vet but since they agreed, she is extremely calm and lets me do it from the comfort at home. I want to do all I can for her and she seems to be more active and maybe a bit better now. Her numbers were the exact same one month after her diet/Azodyl start (they gave me the sad time estimation left due to that) but I saw the improvement a bit after the IV treatment so I will see if the fluid treatment + in combination with the rest will hopefully show lower numbers and maybe the time estimation will change. I'm happy to hear you had so much more time with yours ♥",2022-04-30 02:43:04

aigfnc,"[I have one! ♥️ ](https://i.imgur.com/cHQu7Mn.jpg) well, I rescued him from under a gate in my neighborhood where he spent most of his newborn weeks.",2019-01-22 03:40:52
aigfnc,"Malamutes  need the cooler weather. My family had a beautiful and loving malamute but but did she hate the summer (and we loved in the mountains, had harsh winners, etc.). Every winter she slept in the snow outside and loved it! She would curl up into an adorable puffball and snooze the night away. The crazy fur they have? That's some wicked insulation! There is a reason she didn't want to be inside where we had the fireplace cranked up. In the morning she would wake up and bounce around ready to romp though the snow. 

Also, we could never stop brushing her... The shedding was non-stop. Dog hair in everything. You can't own anything and not have dog hair in it... Coffee in the morning? Yup, it's got dog hair in it. Just a fact of life with a malamute.

And not sure if it was specifically just to our good girl it if it's not if a general malamute trait in general (we only ever had one), but she was very protective of our family. This can be both good and bad. She was very loyal but definitely instigated some fights with other dogs on several occasions (ones she thought may have posted a threat). Because she was rather large for a female (not fat, just big), it made the whole situation worse. Nothing bad every came of it and no dogs were ever hurt, but she was a bit protective as she got older.

Still though, best dog ever. Like a loving, shedding cloud. ♥️",2019-01-22 14:11:55
aigfnc,Can we see her? 😋 ,2019-01-22 16:31:36

aigfnc,"I don't have any yet actually, I just graduated, I'm waiting till I get a job and can afford to buy one and take care of it properly.  :) 
Being in a third world country, keeping dog as a pet is seen as a luxury here. 😀 ",2019-01-22 19:43:51
aigfnc,"That's very smart. I'm not sure how you feel about it, but have you considered adopting a dog? All of the dogs I have had since my malamute have been adopted and they have been wonderful additions to my family! I always feel so lucky to give a dog a loving, safe, and happy home, especially because many of the dogs in the U.S. are euthanized if they are not adopted. I've had several rescue dogs and they've been so loving and kind - you can tell how appreciative they are off being rescued. Just something to consider 😊",2019-01-22 20:57:21

xxt5pl,"I was working on an alpaca farm for a few months and when you get to learn each individual well enough you can tell when it’s coming. And you can start to hear a gurgle as it travels up. The deeper and longer the gurgle, the worse it’s going to smell because they don’t have any fresh cud to spit- it’s coming from down deep and has been partially digested already. It’s rancid 🤣 given, this whole process only takes maybe 2 seconds, but those are precious moments when facing such a horrific smell as you’re aware!",2022-10-07 15:05:39
xxt5pl,Oh interesting! I guess I’ve only seen them on farms where they are regularly sheared in which case it’s pretty easy to tell based on size. Now that you’ve pointed that out I realize I probably wouldn’t be able to tell a small llama from an XL alpaca even sheared though 😅,2022-10-07 18:30:51

8dbory,"Thank you! And regardless of the time put in thank you for taking a part of your life and sacrificing it. I come from a long line of marines in my family and even though most of them did it because of family tradition, a lot of them wouldn’t because they’re too chicken shit to do it and are scared. It’s important work, all of it. Kyle thinks what he does is grunt work and it’s not important, but it is. Every job is. Thank you for your service and time. I hope things are going well for you now! When he calls me I’ll definitely tell him you’re an AO and I’ll let you know how hard he rolls his eyes 😊",2018-04-23 16:59:44
8dbory,">Kyle thinks what he does is grunt work and it’s not important, but it is

I give greenshirts a ton of respect because of this.  In a lot of ways they are like us ordies... they have a reputation that isn't great, they get a lot of shit from other rates, they work long and hard hours, and its hard to see exactly how your role plays a part in the overall picture.  

But just like ordies, the carriers mission could not be accomplished without greenshirts.  

We always said the planes would be useless if they had no ordnance loaded on them, but they would also be useless if they couldn't take off from a ship or land on that same ship.  If the arresting gear and the people who maintain it were not there then a carrier would be pointless, and the same thing for the people who maintain the catapults.  A carrier would be useless without the ability to launch planes. 

>I’ll definitely tell him you’re an AO and I’ll let you know how hard he rolls his eyes 😊

All I ask is you start by saying ""hey, an internet stranger wanted me to tell you IYAOYAS"".  Not really sure how to spell it has its pronounced but its sort of ""i-yoi-yas"".  It stands for ""If you aint ordnance, you aint shit"".  

Hope you get to talk to him soon and thank you for what you are both doing for the military. ",2018-04-23 17:21:57

seadvi,"I have a cat with cerebellar hyperplasia (cat version of cerebral palsy). His limbs are extremely stiff and his tail is always sticking up, never goes down. So I think being picked up is physically uncomfortable for him. He's very sweet and loving but he doesn't like to sit on laps. I hear him crack and pop frequently especially as he enters his 10th year of life.

When I first brought him home 9 years ago I had picked him up, he freaked out, kicked violently, flipped out of my arms and landed on his side with an ugly thump 😨😭. So I slowly built up trust with him by picking him up for very short bursts (few seconds at a time) and showing him *""look, I'll put you down it's okay!""* and gave him treats/playtime right after setting him down. It took a while, but now he will tolerate being picked up for a couple of minutes. If he's feeling extra loving he will even wrap his paws around my neck, put his face under my hair and purr and purr 🥰.

When he's had enough he will lean away from me and I set him down.",2022-01-28 14:45:40

a09mmk,"Reminds me of a dog I had growing up. He was my best friend. When I was a child, I was physically handicapped and was on a walker for about 6 months. Our family dog noticed that I wasn’t walking so he would let me grab onto his fur and the two of us would go wherever. After a long time of physical therapy (and the dog helping me) I was finally able to walk and do anything anybody else can. I’m now a former racer, won two gold medals in a row and a silver one. When we had Polo (our dog) he was also very protective over me. When someone he didn’t know would be around me or if another dog was around me, he would step in between the other person or dog and I until he knew them better. We were like two peas in a pod

10tnxsc,I just lost my 16 year old GSD/ Husky mix in December. Her fur was a creamy blond. When we updated the flooring in the house I picked out tile that went with her coloring 😁. She only spent her last years with me. The rotten people who had her early in life were not nice. So she really didn't like to be touched. She got better about being scratched and bathed but always hated being brushed. So I didn't brush her very often. Only when the tufts of blown out hair were obvious. So there was a lot of dog fur on the floor and couch. Callie is gone now and I can wear black again. But I miss her fur everywhere.,2023-02-05 13:55:03

At the end, when he was going under the rope, I half expected him to put a knife / saber of some kind in his mouth like some kind of James Bond cat. Pretty impressive.


I'm hoping when I get a new cat that I can train the kitten to go on a leash.

It’s such an apt description.",2022-11-23 13:04:22
z2cx8w,"Since we saw her everyday for the past three years, we didn’t totally notice how drastic the change was until looking at older pictures.

The darkening of her face was the most obvious, but the fur darkening on her body was so gradual it slipped by our notice until suddenly “look how dark she is!” She used to be a little snowball, now she’s like that dirty/slushy snow. Or, more affectionately, a little baked potato/toasted marshmallow.

It would make for a good sitcom episode. Gradually switch out the cat with one that has slightly darker/different features, and see how long it takes someone to say anything, or think they’re going crazy 😂",2022-11-23 13:02:37

z2cx8w,"Ooo the carnelian coat is cool! Like a dilute brown tabby but... not a dilute tabby lmao I never looked into the colouring of forest cats before bc I genuinely was like ""ah yes a ginger cat"" 😆 There's actually a cat in my neighbourhood that I swear has that amber colouring (the reason I call him ""Mr Blondie lol) but I know from his owners that he's definitely not a pure bred... maybe he needs to take a trip to UC Davis for study lol This is similar to what I was thinking about the burmese coat-- the pattern looks really similar to a ""ticked"" coat!

I'm sure it depends on what cats are around in a given region, but my city actually has a ton of dilute, randomly breed cats!",2022-11-23 21:27:26
z2cx8w,"Sorry, yes I meant dilutes of all kind! The most common seems to be apricot tabbies-- when I was little I use to just think that we had ""pale"" cats bc they adapted to the Canadian snow lmao

From how it was explained to me, any dilute cat may also carry the Dm gene 🤷‍♀️ But iirc I think the Dm gene originated in the UK, and there's many british people who move here and bring their cats, so it would make sense that our wandering cat population is more likely to carry the Dm gene!",2022-11-24 02:57:34

We adopted him from a local shelter that estimated he was ~3 years old at the time and we named him Apollo. He has always been absolutely *terrified* of stepping even a single foot into any bathroom. I was going thru some heavy emotional stress back in August of this year (2020) and I could feel a panic attack on the horizon while I was in the bathroom. Apollo ended up coming into the bathroom, without me calling him, and comforted me. I didn’t end up having the panic attack and the whole experience made me appreciate adopting him that much more.

Sort of as expensive as the 116 mastiffs you’d need for protection if you were living gun free . And don’t even get me start on vet bills . Now consider the cost of running that household.  If they are stuffed plush toys, well shoplifting is actually free but there are risks.

But you’d never have  to worry about the cost of entertaining visitors, human or otherwise if those bears are alive.

The booster part is great for them to be able to look out the window but the seat itself can’t be attached safely and (the version I had) had a ridiculously unsafe attachment for the dog’s harness.

af699n,"I used to help Rehabilitate Gambel's quail when I lived in Arizona. It is very common for chicks to become separated from their parents because parents do not keep count or wait for their young to keep up so they often get left behind. Therefore, we would get about 200-300 quail chicks every breeding season. If you do find a quail chick you should bring it to an avian rehab clinic so it can be properly cared for, raised and released.😊",2019-01-12 13:34:33

guih7i,"Okay horsie fact time. Horses have what we call one of the most explosive birth processes - from nose breaching to fully expelled you are usually talking only twenty minutes! 

That means as horse owners we try to be there for the foaling because if things go wrong they go wrong pretty fast. So I set up night cameras and a foaling alarm when she is close, and a monitor inside. I sleep on the floor on a swag near the monitor and alarm. All my foaling kit and boots are at the door. When she lays down to foal, the alarm goes off and in my brain fog I can see what’s going on the monitor, grab kit and pull on boots. By the time I get to the yard the foal is halfway out 😯 

I watch from a distance and don’t interfere unless I have to. I take notes like how long it takes for her to get up, to drink and to potty. I disinfect her navel and check mum is ok. I clean everything up. The placenta comes out later (gross I know) and I will take it and spread it out to make sure all of it is there and nothing is left in mum which would make her sick.

The next day I share beautiful photos ❤️❤️❤️ then the vet will come and do a blood test to make sure Whisky is getting her antibodies from mum. Mum gets a big yummy feed and some painkillers. Can’t help with the headache that is looking after a rambunctious child but everything else is taken care of!",2020-06-01 15:19:13

It will show I have systemically deprived them of on-demand tummy scratches, car rides (to work, in almost all cases, but we will let the jury decide if that alibi checks out), and essentially all of my food and instead given them horrible dog food every day despite their demands. They are also forced to do hard labor like “sitting” and “staying”, and at least once per year, they are made to wear degrading costumes purely for my amusement.

paa6ri,"100% true and correct. Have had a giant one in my car before, marching determinedly across my windscreen after I foolishly parked under a big tree at night to go watch a movie. Leapt out of that car & my feet didn’t even touch the ground! Had to ask a nice guy walking past to chase it out of my car before I could get in & drive home. My friend took years to forgive me bailing on her out of the car & leaving her there with a very riled up spidey running towards her!

Another time my car brushed past a bush in our driveway, I got out & was walking inside towards the loo when I saw what I thought was my long hair on my shoulder, and flicked it out of the way. No. It was not my hair, it was one of the biggest huntsmans I’ve ever seen and it had clearly hitched a ride on my shoulder all the way from the car & into my house!! When I flicked it in blind panic it then sailed through the air only to land on the one loo we had, and with me busting to go! I had to get a broom to chase it off the loo so I could go.

gpyoh0,"Many dogs do better in pairs, Huskies in particular need another animal in the pack, a second husky is preferable. Some dogs like shiba though can be just as, if not more happy as an only child, if they are siblings there is typically no issue. But adding a second unknown shiba in may be more of a disruption than a help. 

I abhor doodles, not individually but as an existing fad for health and care issues for the whole idea and thier existence. Even the creator made a public apology for making them as he should. 

My German shepherd is a very small female at about 50lbs. She does poop as large as my 85lb weimaraner though. She is incredibly content to be an only child and cuddles right up to us. But her brother needs a canine companion and so we have two. 

Keeping a neighbor kid on poop patrol isnt awful, but neither is getting a claw scoop so you dont have to bend over!

po6zvj,When I get my own place I plan on adopting a dog from the shelter! I wish I could adopt one now. It makes my heart hurt thinking about all the dogs and cats who want and need all the love 💗,2021-09-15 06:17:14
po6zvj,"Anyone able to adopt a shelter dog is wonderful! Thank u for being attention to this! Unfortunately a lot of ppl during the pandemic did this without bothering to know the dog’s history or info of the breed and returned them like a friggin toy. It’s so important to know ur training abilities and if the dog is an even semi-decent match before getting a shelter dog so u can feel good about urself and share how much a good person u r on social media. I say u as in anyone, not u personally. I train service dogs for ppl w disabilities and I know what I’m talking about. Please do what’s best for u and do ur research on breeds ❤️",2021-09-15 09:07:53

po6zvj," Totally with you on this. Shelter dogs are often overlooked, but they make such wonderful and loyal pets. It's indeed heart-wrenching to see them longing for a home. Did the article mention any specific breeds or stories that stood out to you? It's always inspiring to hear about successful adoptions. #AdoptDontShop

po6zvj,"Aww, thank you 🥰 My cat Mäuschen was about 7-9yo and super shy when I fell in love with her at the shelter, and even though we had only 3.5 years together until cancer took her from me, I've never regretted adopting her for even a single second... Not only did she bloom into a confident (and very spoiled) lady, but she gave me SO much love and happiness! 1,000/10 would do again in a heartbeat",2021-09-15 09:04:02

s4pf0v,"Thank you!! 🐶💕✨

Edit. 

Oh wow. I don’t have notifications turned on so, I was in for quite the surprise when I opened Reddit 😂 y’all - Pirate blew tf up! I’ve recovered from my exposure panic attack, thanks for asking 😂😭😂

Yesterday was the first time I admitted I had quit drinking to anyone except r/stopdrinking and a few close friends and y’all really did me well! Thank you. 💕💕I feel like the juju and karma and love from this post just reinforced my decision and gave me a reserve to draw from if I’m ever struggling. Cried like 34 times reading your comments. 🥺🥺🤗

To answer some questions: 

1) Pirate (middle name Shamrock btw) is a mini Goldendoodle. He is 8 weeks old and just came home to me. Always adopt, if you can. I wasn’t able to adopt a dog (despite spending months trying too, including twice weekly rescue visits - I live somewhere with a whole bunch of breed restrictions and if you’ve been to a rescue since COVID hit, you know that excludes bout 99.9% of dogs in rescues.) My prior dog (💕🌈💕) was a rescue and I feel good about the decision I made this time but, I know from a quick peruse of the comments this has come up so.  Please don’t flame me, this wasn’t a decision I made lightly. 

2) Just go head and keep up the pirate jokes. Sheesh. 😂 

3) I referenced it above but r/stopdrinking is the nicest place on the internet (right along with r/eyebleach). If you’ve ever wondered bout your drinking, come see us. COVID hit different and changed a lot of our drinking habits in a way that has been challenging to rein back in. It’s cool, there is hope. It’s not the end of the world and you’re definitely not alone. 

Imma try and respond to all your comments but, Pirate woke up and chose violence 😂😂🐶 so, I have my hands full. 

Shoutout to the sad comments - I’m sorry a puppy and a girl trying to better her life made you sad and upset. Here is a cookie 🍪 I still got love for ya! (Pirate thinks ya basic tho 💅🏼)

I LOVE YOU REDDIT - WE’RE OUT. 🐶🐶🙋🏻‍♀️",2022-01-15 17:32:49

7a2gco,I love how you can see nothing but their little paws under their bellies❤️,2017-11-01 10:44:34
7a2gco,"i said nothing about them being cute. i don’t actually care about their appearance. i love pugs but i frequently tell people that they shouldn’t exist no matter how cute they are. my 13 year old munchkin passed in january due to natural causes without pain. my roommate’s 4 year old munchkin regularly terrorizes my 13 year old dsh, jumps onto my 14 inch inch platform bed, desk, and the kitchen counters without issue. their spinal problems have not been attributed to their breed, and regularly occur in full sized breeds and we don’t know that they’re in pain. i don’t believe in culling an entire species because of idle speculation that can’t be proven conclusively. put money into the research, breed them responsibly, and make conclusions based on actual scientific evidence, not specious claims borne of observations of other species of animals. if conclusive evidence comes out to the contrary, i will happily retract my opinions and rail against them the same way i do against pugs, bulldogs, and inbred german shepherds.

thanks so much for the debate, but i have to get back to work now. let’s agree to disagree and move on with our days. 😊",2017-11-01 13:39:18

A few weeks ago she had to have several growths removed and instead if her recovering in the kennels, they made a bed for her in their break room.

9ty1xv,"Ah, OK 😁",2018-11-04 13:12:09
9ty1xv,"No, it won't. It allows the food to be aided by gravity so that it can pass more normally. But if there's still decreased esophageal peristalsis and/or a dysfunctional lower esophageal sphincter, sitting upright won't fix it. That's why the dogs typically have to eat standing up and then stay in that position for a bit to allow the food to pass. The esophagus will typically stay quite dilated.

No worries about the account title. I've seen worse 😂",2018-11-05 00:47:08

It disappeared, and he didn't think much of it since he assumed it didn't know he was there. Then, when he happened to look up, the son of bitch was staring him dead in his face. Like those cats. He backed away slowly while they both were staring at each other. 😅🤣",2024-03-29 07:25:38

Edit: from what I’ve noticed from my bird, he loves his feathers being stroked in the opposite direction. I don’t know if it’s a bird thing or just mine, but either way he loves it!",2020-05-19 23:52:39

I think docking ears and tails became a thing because of dog fighting (or general guard dog use of the breeds where this is common) because it gives less real estate to catch hold of in a fight.  It just became part of the look of the breed, so people keep doing it even though there's no real purpose.  They're so cute with their real ears, though.  😍",2021-07-14 19:02:23

ok5nsx,"I completely agree with the ear thing, have even asked my vet about it. They said it was purely cosmetic and they advise against it. But  
in certain cases from what I understand (spent  years raising pits, rotties, Cane Corsos, and a variety of labs and shepherds) apparently tail clipping may actually have long term advantages with large breed dogs, as their tails are so large that over the years it can cause serious spine and back problems for the dogs… but I have spoken to many vet techs, breeders, and other people who are knowledgeable when it comes to canine health and it doesn’t seem like I can get an exact answer on this.

Yes indeed and yes you would try other things first but I do know people who milk cows for a living and will use this as an extra option just to be sure that the calf will stay extra warm to preserve the energy of the calf for growing instead of keeping warm. Just look up calf bodywarmers as it is used in the same mindset of preserving the energy of the calf.

 It does have a lot of parts to fiddle with when getting in and out, but it and the ktan were the only ones I personally felt snug enough to be hands free when needed. Side carriers, I always felt like I needed a hand on him just to be safe, and they were rougher on my back with all the weight on one shoulder. 

I loved that my sling had a pocket in its extra flap, so useful. And I keep my keys on a carabiner so I could just clip them straight to the ring!

Are you okay? You poor thing, you need to warm up!” and wouldn’t set her down 😂😂",2018-02-07 04:50:20
7vslf8,"I performed most of my high school graduation requirements for 100 hours of community service at a sick bay in a vet's office. I was inspired to work with cats with skin issues since my first animal companion had a degenerative skin condition that made her irritable with constant pain and a compulsion to bite chunks of her fur out since her skin was so sensitive.

I've had near a dozen cats with wildly different personalities, and combined with my volunteering have helped me really observe how and why some cats appear unaffectionate.

Cats' nerve endings are extremely sensitive. Some more than others. Imagine someone touching your genitals after orgasm, when it feels overpowering in its sensation, and makes your nerves feel overstimulated. 

Some cats simply cannot stand persistent or repetitive touch in particularly sensitive areas, like along their jawlines, near their ears, near their whiskers, near their tail. I don't intend to be crass when I say it's like rubbing the underside of a penis or a clitoris after sex. It's just the best comparison I can think of to help a sad human understand why their cat companion isn't responding to their petting.

Even cats with severe, crippling skin conditions *do* desire affectionate touch, it is just hard to deduce where, how, and how long you can do so.

The simplest advice for *any* cat is to let a cat guide you. Don't reach out and pet them where you think they might enjoy it: Put your hand out and allow them to smell you, consider you, and they will almost always rub themselves against your hand in the area that they are comfortable with touch (or sometimes just itchy 😊). If she rubs he jawline along your hand, she wants you to rub there*. Maybe she sniffs you, adjusts her whiskers several times, and gently bleps her tongue along your fingers. Maybe *that* cat doesn't like petting *at all*, but really likes it when you bring your nose and lips against hers as she smells, senses, and appreciates your presence. This is **affection offered to you** that may be difficult to decipher when your preconception is petting = affection toward animals.

A big problem I saw was overpetting. Most dogs appreciate repetitive motion in petting them, a persistent movement of your hand along their ears, neck, jaw, back, or rump. Most cats are *not * like this. For them, repetitive petting is akin to an erogenous zone being overstimulated. It stops being enjoyable and becomes overbearingly sensitive. Mix up petting a cat after learning where she is comfortable being touched. Stroke her jaw 5 or 6 times, then move to her tail and scratch above it for 5 or so seconds. Once the tail erects, move on to another place, or simply allow her a moment to relax on your lap/beside you giving her a break from the touch of your hand.

Some cats, like some anything, simply don't enjoy petting for whatever reason. It's important to recognize this and deduce that their isn't really anywhere on her body that feels enjoyable to be petted.

But more often than not, even disabled cats enjoy human touch *somewhere*. My first cat, the one with the awful skin condition, liked to stroked beneath her left ear for 10-20 seconds at a time, and then have her left ear rubbed along the sides where I imagine it was itchy to her. It took me **TEN YEARS** to discover that.

Cats communicate with humans to the best of their ability. It is incumbent on human companions to decipher the messages they send. I hope this gives you a little insight that helps you better communicate with your cat, and improves the way you are affectionate to each other.",2018-02-07 05:51:47

whc49l,"Oh no, I'm so sorry! What were they like? If you would like to share, I would like to hear about them.

It's been almost two weeks for me and it does get better, but looking at pictures or thinking about him still gets me, and I miss the aggressively purry cuddles in bed. He was my best kitty ever. He was very quiet and thought staring through a door could get me to open it, even when it was solid wood and I couldn't see him (I think that's because some of the doors in the house have window panes from top to bottom, and then, yeah staring at me worked). He also loved to roll around on top of my shoes, sleep on my chest, and steal my glasses so he could mark the temple tips to show they were his. 🥲

They take her out and present me with the most emaciated puppy I had ever seen. The poor thing was clearly starved but she had a big old head and legs twice the size of her body. So that’s when I found out she definitely wasn’t a chihuahua. Little girl was shaking scared shitless but I knew she had to be my dog. Fast forward my baby is turning 7 this year.

The story of IPAs is a pretty fascinating mix of geopolitical history and science.  When India was a British colony, part of the contract for a British soldier included a daily beer ration.  But pre-suez canal, shipments from England to India required a long journey via sailing ship around the horn of Africa, and many perishables spoiled en route.  Enter the lowly hop, already part of the beer recipe.  Because hops have antioxidant properties, the more hops, the slower the spoilage. And the India Pale Ale, heavy with preserving hops, was born. I hope I got all that right.

I appreciate your support, will put you down for generous beer rations as soon as I take power!🤪",2021-08-12 22:58:43

 The best cat toys are definitely the ones that were never meant to be a cat toy. All purchased cat toys enjoy a moment of play, at best, and then merely collect dust. My cats all love flexible sewing measuring tapes. All measurements begin at 2"" now because the first inch has been lost to the claws and teeth. My husband recently met a Savannah cat that decided his braided beard (with a bead at the end) was a good toy.

8psgde,It is huh? Well you can tell that I really don't know that much about the Bible 😅,2018-06-09 17:37:53
8psgde,"And then everything changed when the Savior died. 

""Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the great and first commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."" (Matthew 22:37-40).

Everything with love, my dude. Including loving people of different sexuality, history, and questionable morals (we're all sinners here lol and anyone can be 'saved').

Edit- added the great and first commandment sentence. Didn't notice that it wasn't in my origional copy and paste 😬",2018-06-09 22:58:56
8psgde,"Can you quote that or find it please? I'm quite sure that was a prophet from the old testiment talking about when Jesus arrives the first time. 

In Matthew 5:17 Jesus says ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."" 

The Law is the 10 Commandments *exclusively*, and the Prophets refer to *all the prophecies about Jesus*, including in Isaiah 42:21 ""The LORD was pleased, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the law and make it glorious"". Jesus is the Lord. 

Jesus came and followed the law to the letter, he never sinned, and because of that he was a glorious, perfect sacrifice that atoned the sins for all that believe in him. No longer are we doomed to die when we sin, but in gratitude/awe/reverence/respect born-again Christians try our darndest to follow in Christ's footsteps (which is why the 10 Commandments are still relevant).

Plus the 10 Commandments are just useful for general laws, ie do not murder, do not bear false witness, etc

What changed when Christ came to save us, is the *ceremonial laws*, in Ephesians 2:13-16 Paul says: ""But now in Christ Jesus you who were once far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility by **abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances,**... and might **reconcile us to God** in one body through the cross, **thereby killing hostility**.""

The ordinances were the acts of ritual animal sacrifice, circumcision, etc by the Isrealites to God, acting as a brutal placeholder until Christ came and saved the world. They were hostile acts and it's repeated over and over that God does not like animal sacrifice (Psalm 40:6, 51:16, etc), but it was necessary for 'repentance' at that time. The animal sacrifices also pointed to a time when the perfect sacrifice would come to save us all, and acted as a reminder that in God's eyes, all sin is deadly serious. The ordinances were not written by the hand of God, but by Moses in the book of Moses. When Christ came, he overthrew the ordinances but fulfilled and amplified the law (the 10 commandments). 

I hope that makes sense. Let me know if not/if you have any more questions :) 

Edit- also like to state that I will never apologize for my beliefs. Please, don't mistake gentleness and patience for apologies or shamefulness. 

Although if I misquote or have a typo I might apologize 🤔",2018-06-12 14:43:15

Now I’m realizing that the same is probably true the other way. I remember the smell of my beloved dog’s ears, it is such a strong memory. I have a cat now and I do the same with him. I like to think about how much stronger their ability to discern different smells is, to the point that they can tell their human immediately.

Me and my friend (both fifth grade) were going to visit her dogs grave and the cows cam up to the fence and she immediately told me to stay calm and let's walk back inside. Next thing I know there are a couple cows bucking and chasing us. One of the most terrifying things I've experienced for sure. I don't think there was a calf but I was like nine and had no exposure to cattle. 🤷 I want to get over my dear but idk anyone who owns cows anymore.,2018-02-17 03:22:22

12cikym,"I recognised those boots and that run. 😄 I used to watch Tim Faulkner on old Bondi Vet episodes.

> Wrestling a saltwater crocodile, wrangling a deadly Taipan and milking a Funnel-web spider is all in a days work for Tim Faulkner and that still leaves time in this passionate conservationists day to release a blue-tongued lizard, tag a wild platypus and save the Tasmania Devil from extinction, topped off with coordinating his responsibilities as General Manager and Head of Conservation at the Australia Reptile Park in Somersby NSW and The Devil Ark at Barrington Tops NSW. Tim Faulkner is the Australian Geographic Australian Conservationist of the Year 2015.

>Tim’s dedication to conservation extends beyond his professional life into him being a personal Ambassador and activist on behalf of several Australian animals. He was instrumental in initiating the not-for-profit organisation and is the General Manager and on the Board of Directors of, The Devil Ark, a large-scale conservation breeding facility for Tasmanian Devils in the Barrington Tops of NSW. In 2015 he became a patron for the Great Koala National Park, he is also an Ambassador for the Quokka and the Australian Dingo Coalition.

Edit: i forgot to provide a link to a tazzy devil episode from his show.
