They shouldn't have been able to do that to begin with, let alone participate in the olympics.

81aysv,"I really think he's the 🐐. I was just old enough to watch the MJ glory years and have been fortunate enough to watch all of LeBron's career, and while MJ was probably more clutch, I truly don't believe MJ had the complete skillset of LeBron. LeBron can play any position on the court, including a crazy stretch 5 center, and come out on top. 

His mix of freakish size and speed, incredible handles, extra sensory court perception, reliable shooting % from any location on the court I just, I don't think MJ had that complete skillset. I mean, we're splitting hairs, but as a complete package, I don't even think MJ could touch that. That doesn't hate on MJ that isn't to say MJ doesn't have a case anymore, but if I had to pick one guy to play with between MJ and LeBron, I'd want LeBron. I'd want the guy who is the best player on the floor no matter what position he's slotting in.",2018-03-02 05:22:06

Cena feeds off that though.  He knows who he's cheered by and, someone else posted a clip of an ECW Match where they kept throwing his shirt back, he eats it up.  He KNEW that they were going to keep throwing it back but he was selling it.  He wanted them to toss it back over and over again because it SELLS him as the bad guy.

Fans of wrestling are able to disconnect ""John Cena"" and the actual John Cena person.  I don't like the character he plays because he's NOT sold to be someone I like.  However, John Cena the person, is a fucking outstanding man and because of that, deserves every single thing he gets in life that he's gotten.  Kids love him and he knows it and makes hundreds of children's wishes come true with Make-a-Wish™ foundation.

So he's actually an outstanding person.  People like to rag on him because he eats it up and lives with it.  It doesn't bother him.",2018-04-15 20:01:25

From my under standing there were two reasons for that one was to hurt slave holders. Granted this is the only reason they'll teach but the other reason was to jack up shipping rates for the northern shipping companies, benefits for shippers, ship builders, ship crew, most importantly ship owners, dock hands dock owners so on and so forth, every benefit from these taxes were for the north while crippling the south. 

That was the main reason for the south wanting to separate. Taxation without fair representation. Sound familiar? 

I will when heartedly agree that slavery is 💯 immoral disgusting and should have been abolished years before it was.",2020-06-14 21:00:45

8wdc7r,"I keep reading these comments shitting on ITV stream player.

I'm legit scratching my head down here in Australia.

Let me explain...

In 2012 I flew from Australia to England for a gap year.

1st thing I signed up for was unlimited cellular data for £15 pounds a month.  

FUCKING HEAVEN.

Australian data plans are ridiculously expensive and the internet is shit house speeds. To lob into England and have unlimited data at fast speeds for a reasonable price was just like being on another planet.

The Olympics were on... next thing I do is tether my phone to my MacBook 💻 and start streaming HD Olympics on the BBC website. Multiple sports options all on HD and free and no limit to my data usage. 

Not one glitch. Not one buffering moment. All in HD.

FUCKEN PERFECT.


Now 6 years later... I am reading that you guys are having these problems with ITV and I am wondering what the fuck is going wrong!??!? 

How has it gone downhill in 6 years?",2018-07-05 22:24:03

But ITV Player is just a shitty streaming platform, it’s not built very well.
BBC iPlayer is definitely a better streaming service, hence your better experience during the Olympics.

We did literally nothing to prevent people from bringing back the virus. I came back to the US at the end of March after travelling around to a few different countries, and when I got back there were basically no precautions being taken.

None of the agents told me to isolate. They didn’t even fuckin ask which countries I came from. I literally just walked through, picked up my bag, and could’ve gone off infecting people.

dnn0v3,">and probably because he drops 40 on your team 🤷‍♂️

Since you guys are salty about Harden, this user implied it is because Harden drops 40 on your team. There is no mention of flopping here. 

>And 28 are from the free throw line.

This user is claiming that 28 of Harden's 40 hypothetical points were from free throws, implying that that invalidates those 40 points. There is no mention of flopping. 

So since there's been no mention of flopping, the implication is that shooting 28 free throws is a bad thing. Which is the point I'm addressing. 40 points is 40 points. If your bum ass team couldn't stay in front of Harden without reaching/fouling, then that's on them lmao. Now if Harden shot 28 free throws due to 14 flops - I would definitely understand the outrage, and be outraged myself. 

You can't possibly be so dumb as to see a large number of free throws, and immediately assume a league wide conspiracy is in place to award Harden and ONLY Harden, a generally unliked player, extra points? And let me guess, you believe Harden chokes in the playoffs because the refs swallow their whistles? A quite confusing, paradoxical conspiracy, isn't it?",2019-10-27 07:16:44

Standing up, he sighs again and he walks to the window, all the while gingerly reaching into his pocket for something. He approaches the window to muffled chants, the sun breaking through water spot ridden window panes.

The ambassador opens the window to an explosion of Mexican cheers and chants; green red and white fill his courtyard. Putting his dusty shades on a hush falls over the crowd and nothing but the occasional camera shutter. He pulls his hand out of his pocket holding a stereo remote, the crowd silence intensifies and a song begins.

I had not seen either of them in years and got recognized and asked, jokingly if I had my homework done.

I DON'T want to believe it! He made such an impact to so many people, basketball related or not. Rest in Peace Kobe & Gigi.

7xrgyt,"A coach and an alum of the school. Maybe they can dedicate their field/stadium to his memory.

♥️

Edit: Thank you kindly for the upvotes. My father was the first principal at Stoneman Douglas (he literally and figuratively built the school from the ground up) and knows the current principal. I am going to ask my dad to pass along the idea of naming the field(s).

The athletic director was killed, too, and the baseball team won a state title under his tenure. (I believe his name was Hixon.) He was an Iraq War veteran. So that might be another field worth naming. 

As an aside, my dad is absolutely distraught by what happened. It’s been a long time since he left the school, but he had a very special connection having been the first principal. It’s been hard on our entire family because we were there to experience that time with him, too.

Lots of love to the whole Douglas family. We are grieving with you, too.",2018-02-15 18:55:21

A gun cannot be, will never be, and is irrelevant to the *cause* of this issie.

I’ve never killed anyone and have 37 years of shooting experience, so you’re wrong. That’s ok. It’s ok to be wrong, even on Reddit. You’re entitled to your opinion, but if you try to dispute a fact, dont be suprised if someone calls you out.

I get it. You think gun control would make a difference. That is your opinion. Mine is that It wouldn’t, it hasnt ever, and it never will - for so many reasons which have been well elaborated on here, including in my other comments.

But hey - if it makes you feel better, keep your tunnel vision on this issue...

Have a nice day 😃

euwixj,"Me too. I’ve never known a rockstar chef before until I “met” him through (watching) No Reservations/Parts Unknown. I like Jamie Oliver too and learned many simple (mostly his take on italian cooking) dishes but Antony Bourdain was this iconic, hot chef who travelled the world, doing things I wish I can do (I’m no chef) and experiencing the culture through food.

I think I have always travelled and enjoyed local culture when I travel through food like he did. That was his influence on me.

I specially have held him in high esteem specially when he featured Manila/Philippines in his many travels. He was appreciative of the local dishes and not a snob and I liked that in him. 

Ps: I know this might sound like out of some conspiracy theory thing but am I the only one who thinks he didn’t kill himself? Anyway that’s neither here or there 🙃",2020-01-28 07:54:42

I don't get reddit anymore. Comments like *""Oh damn didn’t know that lmao""* used to be the comments that were disproportionately downvoted. It's an unnecessary reaction comment with no punctuation and an acronym for laughing (which seems seems out of place if you weren't actually laughing at the concussion, unless you're just one of those people that just ends every sentence with lol/lmao/roflmao/😂😂😂 -- Reddit used to excessively hate those people, though). But I guess people feel like it's not good enough to upvote the comment that says he got a concussion, so they need to use your comment as an expressive upvote to show that they also oh damn didn't know that lmao.

926z5p,"This is an awesome video! I knew his name, and remember him getting lots of hype while playing in college, but I had no idea that Leonard Fournette was such a great guy. I had not realized what this video was about, but, for some reason, I watched it. And I'm an Arizona native and a Cardinals fan and I saw the Cardinals logo in the background in the stadium where this video was taken and it got my attention. Seeing how Fournette went out of his way to do something really nice for a fan, and the genuine reaction the fan had while Fournette was giving him his shoes and signing them for him, it made me happy to watch.

I now consider myself a Leonard Fournette fan and I hope he has great success and make lots of money, that I'm sure he will use to help other people with.

By the way, I just had my Twitter account suspended a few hours ago, for talking shit about Jennifer Lopez, because of how much of a greedy, selfish, cheapskate, scumbag bitch she is; so, it makes me happy to know that there are good people like Leonard fournette out there to root for! It helps to balance out the hatred and resentment I have towards people like Jennifer Lopez, Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan.

Go fuck shit upin the NFL, Mr. Fournette! As long as you're not playing my Cardinals, that is. And please keep being the awesome human being you are!! 😁

Edit: Thanks for sharing this video, OP. It really did make me happy to watch and I appreciate you enlightening me about the kindness and generosity of Leonard Fournette.",2018-07-27 07:59:51

I would have never expected something this ignorant to be upvoted so much 😕 

Nobody understands anything about anyone else it seems. Up until recently, western society held very oppressive views on all sorts of societal issues. 

We changed. It was hard and it took a lot of sacrifice, but we got it done and we are better for it. 

These other cultures that are in other places in the world cannot be held to our western standards. They are facing things that cannot be easily explained and change is hard to come by when the entire structure is designed to keep things the same. 

Iran and Islamic society is gradually changing. It may seem like progress isn't being made, but there are a lot of reasons for optimism (like the people of Iran voting for a progressive candidate instead of a fundamentalist in the last presidential election).",2019-07-05 22:00:54

Just being able to do what he is doing is nothing short of an enigma. I feel your are taking this exact technical angle in attempt to discourage this man. I take your comments as elitist. Would you say what you said just in this conversation to a man lifting with cerebral Palsy at the gym struggling to do his best. This man is recovering from not only one of my worst personal fears but a horrific spinal injury where me the average man would have crumbled an probably died. AND HES FUCKING DEADLIFTING BRO! Yet you want to criticize. Look at the positive. Small victories man sometimes mean the world.   

Edit: As a current golf professional whom just came back from a bad elbow tear this year. I know first hand that form takes a while to regain. If you demand perfection immediately you will only set yourself up to fail. ",2018-12-07 03:56:20

The dangerous mentality I referred to... how many concussions have been compounded after the initial knockout? I find it hard to watch, I think of the fighter, the long term impacts on their life, and their family's lives. I know it's their choice to get in the ring, but no one plans to lose, and no one would chose to get blasted after they are already knocked out, (Or incapacitated). What about the example this sets for society. The blood lust for violence I believe this rule (lack of rules) propagates is dangerous on a larger scale. There are so many rules now, why not a few more? Or we can just go back to when you were allowed to punch your opponent in the nuts, and have a real fucking death match.

b70aci,"The ""get it"" part must take some getting worked out and getting used to it. And for these pros it must be a fine line they understand that in any given opportunity like this, it can be perceived very differently. There was a press conference where Roger Federer was being asked about what it was like to play the new generation of incoming top twenty players in their early twenties, and without irony or self awareness he said that it was good for the game, that it was a good opportunity for the young guys to play top players like him and learn from the experience. I thought wow, were it not Federer and if it were someone else like say Novak Djokovic, the would have been any number of snide articles deriding Novak for daring to think he was that good. 



This being a simpler kind act of genuine recognition of something special I think it played out very naturally so it's hardly I think in danger of being compared to the above example. And holy shit when he stood up I was like that must be a tiny table he's sitting at 😂",2019-03-29 21:28:54

I explained that there was still around 10 mins left plus injury and that France could still come back if they scored a goal as the pressure would be on Argentina team with momentum with France. Literally seconds later the penalty for France and then Mbappe’s goal.

hands down the best final in ages, the amount of emotions i went through, probably havent felt that since the spurs v ajax champions league semifinal…

In 2009, she threatened a female ump with “shoving the fucking ball down” her throat.

[In 2011, when Serena was called for hindrance for clearly screaming during the backswing of Sam Stosur in their U.S. Open final, she lost it again, screaming at the chair and at one point asking if she was the one who “screwed me before,” confusing Eva Asderaki with another European woman, Louise Engzell, who was in the chair for the ’09 match.](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/09/serena-williams-us-open-tantrum-outburst-controversy-penalty) 

Shes a very talented player who has a really bad temper, reacts violently when called out, and is a sore loser. That makes her a shit ambassador

However, after getting super sick with what was likely Covid early in the pandemic and having long term symptoms I started doing yoga 4-5 days a week for about an hour a day. The added strength and flexibility has made a huge difference in how my knees feel. (and the rest of my body).  I am not cured but fuck my quality of life is much better than it was before. Better enough that I feel compelled to tell others with similar ailments on a random thread on reddit that yoga works. 🤣 I eat a lot less ibuprofen now too.",2021-01-29 01:28:59
