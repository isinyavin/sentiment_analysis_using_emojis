We got a LOT of soviet bloc TV, specially their creepy kids cartoons that did not make us kids trust the east any more.. quite the opposite effect, while Disney® and everything from Hollywood was fun, exciting, positive... and we knew how bad it was in the Soviet, Finlandization just meant that our government didn't tell us that.",2020-04-06 20:13:04

Want *private* rides, drive *yourself*.
How would you feel if we as drivers had a ""Quiet Pax"" request where we would stop you from yapping about your first world problems on your Bluetooth during a Pool ride?
Or when you're too drunk to drive yourself home and rely on us to get you home safely while dealing with your prejudice drunken ass and hoping you don't blow chunks all over?

We put up with you because we have to. 
Don't make our jobs miserable because you want your chaffeur to lock it up.

Just know we can just as easily decline or end the ride if pax turn into silent Karens.

This post popped up as one of the top posts last year I think. After lurking the comments, I stumbled across your comment and saw the part about potentially living in a non-corrupt world.

I had only just woken up when I read it and so my initial post-waking agitation kicked in due to the insane amount of corruption that’s come out between one year ago and now and how much worse off we are and are going to get and couldn’t hold back lol.

Also wait. You don’t clean lenses on set!? Just one-and-done? None of you have blowers or brushes or pancro or kimwipes in your kits?

Dude. Go to panavision or keslow camera and say “Im a 2nd AC but I’m scared to clean lenses on set” and they’ll show you how to do it and you’ll be 10x more valuable to your 1st AC and DP. You’re covered by production insurance, so even if you biff it hard (which shouldn’t happen after your lesson from the lens techs in the rental houses) it’s not like you’re personally liable. So go!

But yeah, I have nothing against people being transgendered, and I'd go into war to fight for their equal rights. However, I simply haven't taken the time to study every word I should or shouldn't say. I'm still not completely sure if there is or isn't another word for transvestite in Norway, but either way we generally don't use it to belittle somebody, but mainly to describe. 

And the thing about my grandpa is that he is dressed like a woman 24/7, and my ex-in-law aunt has told me that he has a name for his alternate persona, but still he acts and responds like his usual male personality. So I am not completely sure what that's about. I love him to bits and despite his flaws (removed from the trans bit ofc), he is one of the most important figures in my life. And so is my grandma. 

I am often quick to judge too, so I completely understand the initial downvotes haha. All you need to know is that there are no hard feelings towards transgendered folks ❤",2021-04-04 17:56:43

All of your downvotes are due to poor reading comprehension/misunderstanding the thread. We are talking about one thing and you go off on an unrelated tangent. 

It doesn’t matter that boobs aren’t the female counterpart to balls. We know this and it’s not what’s being discussed. It matters that they’re both dangly private parts that might need to be adjusted slightly...

We all have to make slight adjustments sometimes and that’s okay 🤣",2021-02-14 17:06:49

o2pr7l,"omg. a few weeks back my allergies were worse than they’d ever been. i could feel some sort of snot stuck in my left sinus cavity - no matter how hard i blew or snorted air, it wouldn’t come out and i was losing my shit.

so finally after tilting my head forward, i felt some movement when i would blow my nose. after several minutes i saw the tip of it sticking out of my nose, and a few very hard blows later, i had pulled (literally pulled) a three inch long, hard piece of snot out of my left nostril.

the moment that i finally pulled it out was the. most. satisfying feeling i have ever experienced. i told my boyfriend (after showing him the evidence 😂) that it felt like my face came. i’ve never experienced such a symptom before, and i doubt i will again anytime soon, but GAT DAM it felt good as hell getting it out lol.",2021-06-18 19:17:45

m9u9r3,"For people who use the same password, pay attention! If you use the same email and password for everything, whenever your trusted website will sell that log in information onto a 3rd party company, it is at great risk. They are going to try every single possible website where they think you are liable to use the same log in information. EVEN YOUR EMAIL. Your email is the worst possible thing that they can access, as is requires a password reset with one button of a press for all sites. If you cannot get into that email, you are doomed for all the other sites!

k0pd2g,"Not funny ✅

Could be followed by a generic laughtrack✅

References a daytime television show no one watches ✅

My dad would repost✅


I mean if you think it's funny more power to you. Im not the arbiter of funny and neither are you. Obviously a lot of people disagree with me here. But when I see something my almost 60 year old dad would chuckle at and unironically repost on facebook right after he reads the sunday funnies, I call it boomer humor. 


No offense but I opened up this meme and rolled my eyes. Theres so many other ways to make fun of this creepy permission request from an app that doesn't need it, and they go with a cheesy reaction face and a line from ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"". 

Again, the upvotes and comments mean a LOT of people disagree here. Just giving you my perspective. Again, if it's funny to you then enjoy it. Cheers.",2020-11-25 17:43:40

l790hi,"Webull & Robinhood (along with others) have wrongfully pulled stocks (GME, AMC, BB, NOK etc.) from the market to manipulate gains & losses with interest for billionaires losing on shorts. We have the right to exercise our financial freedoms just as much as large investors/hedge funds. What has been done today by these large investment firms IS criminal!

Then last week she just escaped my friend's apartment and was never seen again. She has barely any experience of cars (my friend lives near a very frequented avenue), so I immediately drove there and spent my lunch break calling for her to no avail.

In all probability she's now either dead in gory circumstances, or living the worst version of her life in the cold and the rain.  I'm just so heart broken, man, we rescued her from the street a few years back, and we love her dearly, she was just a fat and goofy house cat who didn't do anything wrong to deserve this.

kyk3d1,"Much love to everyone remembering their lost pets in the comments

I've lost many pets, but I just happened across a picture of the last 2 rats I'll ever own an hour ago, who I lost to cancer last year, and it hurt. I still sometimes open our den ready to squeal excitedly at them and realize they're not there. They lived on par with their life expectancy, one of which all but made it to 3 years old, but it's still never easy. All pets are special, and pet owners are such special people ❤️",2021-01-16 20:57:56

I'm looking at him curiously and he's looking at me like ""Wtf is that?!"" 😂 He and I were kindred spirits, he passed a few years ago. Just the other day I was reminded of him and I had to cry about it because I missed him. I'm crying now as well, haha. He was the best and I'll always remember my best friend 🖤",2021-01-16 21:04:10

u3afaf,"Hi and welcome to CAPITALISM. You must be new here so let me show you around. 😉

Big companies that become monopolies buy out smaller companies so they can remove competition. They will sell off any assets to make back what little money they can in the short run but in the long run, not having the competition improves their bottom line. Additionally any “talent” that is lost can be rehired for lower wages and a renegotiated contract.

We hope you enjoy your stay 😅",2022-04-14 08:07:57

I honestly don't know. My guess is that because they didn't grow up loving anthros as much as furries did, they don't get it. And the only thing they can do in response to something they don't understand is to hate it. You know, fearing the unknown and all of that.

mrynba,"Guys why don't you understand. 😔. If you took the same amount of both feathers and steel...obviously steel is heavier. But here the weight is predefined which is 100 kg. That means a lotttttttt of feathers and a little bit of steel but the weight is constant 100kg. I don't mind getting downvoted but atleast try to understand what I mean.

Women can have sex all they want together and nobody has to worry about getting pregnant. It’s when an irresponsible man comes into the picture that the possibility arises.

But men don’t tend to be blamed for unwanted pregnancy. There’s no stigma attached to men themselves. Whereas there is so much stigma attached to women being the sole responsible party for unwanted pregnancy i.e. “she should keep her legs closed.”

That was the point that I was trying to draw attention to with my phrasing. It’s not the woman spreading her legs that is the problem. Woman can spread their legs all they want with each other and there isn’t any chance of unwanted pregnancy.",2023-02-22 12:53:32

then another crow (or the same ) is doing the same shit again (this all happening within a few seconds, like watching a speeding car go by on a 15mph road)
and the eagle, ready this time, fucking barrel rolls like a BOSS, the crow flys past missing and now behind the others from its failed attempt.

j2irbw,"I actually do this a lot.

An example of this: earlier today, I went to Cracker Barrel with my two sisters (younger and youngest), my grandmother, and my great grandmother. I was being stubborn because they dragged me into going with them to a food place when I wasn’t even hungry. They got me a sprite and a pancake. I did not eat the pancake at first, because I was being stubborn. Then after I realized my mistake, I started shouting at myself and calling myself names like “You’re a disgrace.”, “Quit crying over a pancake, you big baby.”, and more. And yes, I was crying because I’m very emotionally unstable and I’m just a big crybaby in general. I did eventually eat the pancake though, so it turned out fine.

dxs7lv,"Actually the upper limit for LASIK nowadays is closer to -14....but you’d have to have a very thick cornea. ICLs are definitely the better option though for that high of myopia. But in order to get ICLs you’d first have to get peripheral iridotomies (unless you live in Europe and can get a fenestrated ICL). Also you have to have a deep enough posterior chamber to qualify for an ICL. Finally, ICLs run the risk of causing cataracts sooner in life. ✌🏻",2019-11-18 04:49:38

dxs7lv,"I live in the United States so everything I’m saying is based on our current technology and methods of practice.
So the implantable contact lens (ICL) usually is placed behind the iris and in front of your natural lens. This area is called the posterior chamber. When placed here, the ICL could  block the flow of aqueous in your eye which could cause a high pressure spike in your eye.  So you either need to have an ICL with fenestrations ( little holes in the middle of the lens to allow flow of aqueous) OR you need to have a laser procedure done where they make a little hole in the outer part of your iris (peripheral iridotomies). Either option provides an alternate route for the aqueous to flow to make sure the ICL doesn’t block it. Unfortunately, here in the states the fenestrated IOLs are not approved to be used (we’re always behind the times here) so anyone who gets an ICL first has to have peripheral iridotomies. Hope that helps! ✌🏻",2019-11-19 00:49:17

ed88ac,"I agree. But I'll add for others:

- Start with exercise.   
- Do something--anything. 
- Find a routine and stick with it for a while (consistency is step one for results)....
- ...But change it up every so often to avoid plateau (or boredom) 
- [this one is just my personal preference as a girl, so ymmv]  For your summer body, start cutting in March (if you're a pretty good eater already). It's hard/sucks to diet for a long period of time, plus you don't need a six pack during winter and it's oversized sweaters 😂.

I think 5 months is enough for a big change. But it can require an equivalent amount of effort. Starting easy can be less discouraging and builds the habit.",2019-12-20 17:49:16

oada52,"What, What???

Look up cures for torn arches for your feet. You roll your foot over a cylindrical object when it hurts (soup can advised). For day to day you pull a strip of duct tape long enough to encircle your foot. You start on the top of the foot and go around the side with you arch. Pull harder over the arch but not enough to cut off blood supply or make it supper painful. Then you spend the day with slightly painful yet comfortable shoes on your torn arches. 

I was a cross country runner after I tore my arches. The surgery takes months to heal and had a terrible success rate back when I could have used it. The soup can and duct tape saved my feet, even though it took a while as I kept retesting. 💖💖",2021-06-30 03:09:42

o5zbdm,"This reminds me of a story my dad told me!

I was told this story almost twenty years ago, so the details are a bit fuzzy, but I’ll type what I remember.

My dad has a friend who used to work in a very upscale restaurant in New York, where lots of celebrities frequented/frequent. He would call my dad often and tell him who he’d seen that night.

One day Billy Zane came into the restaurant, no reservation, but that usually wasn’t a problem.
He politely asked if they had any tables, and my dad’s friend, very politely, told him they had no tables available and Billy leaves.

My dad’s friend HATED Billy Zane. Why? Because he played Caledon Hockley; Rose’s millionaire tycoon fiancée in Titanic.

My dad’s friend called him later and told him what happened. My dad, dumbfounded, said, “you turned away Billy Zane because of the character he played?”
His friend kept saying “he’s a bad man!”

They laughed about it later, and how ridiculous my dad’s friend had been 😂.",2021-06-23 06:07:46

iziwgc,"This is the reason I moved from NZ to Gold Coast Australia.

We were planning to move for 3 years, but always something happened, like changed job, or nephews born.

We lived in one of those old old wooden houses with a high ceiling that you can't practically heat, so you just have to walk around with 5 layers and a jumper.

I was in bed, had to go to work and all my clothes were far away from the bed. In reality really didn't want to get out.

I got out, made my day around getting clothes. Fully layered up so I can go to shower, then peel everything off again.

Anyway, that day I just bought plane tickets. Later I left my wife behind to sell everything, and I flew to Australia and got us say to there with a placed to rent.

Luckily I was contacting to a big international company and u could continue working for them in AU.

Now we are happy and toasty and warm ☺️",2020-09-25 18:25:27

Then the line started moving. There were 3 people in front of me. Then two. Then one. I was panicking in my head thinking this lady is going to be mad if I go before she gets a chance to come back. Had to remind myself that she’s not my mom and I won’t be in trouble for moving without her. So I guess you could say there is some residual anxiety from childhood 😅,2021-04-09 05:27:50

I agree with most of your comment, but not necessarily this one. Yes, you need to treat them differently but the truth is that cats and dogs are simply different. I would say that social and 'loving' dogs outnumber social and loving cats by *a lot*. But that's simply because they are different.",2021-06-06 18:54:15
ntouxc,"WWE® is tough to watch in general. All of their Superstars™ have to pander to the WWE Universe™ by following a script to the letter. Meanwhile, that script was rewritten 17 minutes before WWE® Monday Night Raw™ began airing by a 70ish year old man that may or may not be slipping further into senility. 

In fairness, writing 5 hours of television a week has to be fucking impossible.

What the guy above said about NXT and AEW is true. NXT is WWE but without Vince McMahon's involvement, and AEW is a company that has nothing to do with them at all. Regardless, as a casual wrestling fan myself, I absolutely cannot tune in week-to-week. I don't watch anything besides the big events.",2021-06-09 22:28:53

If we're talking about the actual picture and not the memes™, two minutes of reverse image search brought me to [this istock page](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/high-dunes-from-namib-desert-and-the-atlantic-ocean-gm156278254-21692058) where the photographer is credited as Wolfgang Steiner. Now, two photographers named Wolfgang Steiner showed up when I searched, but based on style and composition I'm 90% sure the photographer of this photo is [this guy](https://www.wolfgangsteiner.net/).

j88mlz,"""if black people hate white people its not perfectly fine, its still racism""

And nowhere in this post or story is there any instance of black people hating white people as a whole. 

The creator was writing a story about a black character to represent and inspire black audiences, and despite the fact that the vast, vast majority of comics at the time were centred around white people, was still pressured to include white people in it for the sake of pleasing white people, despite the fact that the story was about black characters, and was intended to cater to black audiences, in a time where black people were severely underrepresented. 

But sure, black supremacy. Lol.

If Ricciardo gets used to the car and starts getting points regularly I don’t think they will be able to challenge them.

Don’t forget that Lando is the one getting the big points for McLaren and that Ricciardo no matter how much currently underperforming is still a very talented driver. But Ferrari has definitely secured P4. I’m excited to see who gets P5-P7. My predictions are:

P1: RedBull

P2: Mercedes

P3: McLaren

P4: 🅱️errari™️©️

P5: Aston Martin

P6: Alpine

P7: AlphaTauri

P8: Alfa Romeo (unless Russell pulls some sort of trap card and scores some good points in a Williams somehow)

P9: Williams

njyw76,"Comfort does not equal Happiness—either real/fake/short-term/long-term. It's just a contributing factor toward having it though. For most people, comfort is financial stability, health insurance, stable work, a safe living environment, confidence that your car isn't going to break down the next time you drive it, a caring circle of family and friends (last example here is debatable). Are these necessary for happiness? No. But money makes somebody more likely to have them, and constantly experiencing the day to day stress for having to deal with the *opposite* situation, basically not having enough money for them since that's what our society pushes people to have, then that can reduce one's ability to be happy. Of course, somebody could also live in a dirt hole and be perfectly happy. 🤷‍♂️",2021-05-24 18:58:23
