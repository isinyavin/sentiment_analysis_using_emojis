I work in the nursing field and wanted to share that the interview linked left an impression on me. It was during an interview with Steven Colbert and you talked about death. Your answer gave me so much peace that I often share that quote with others. When asked what happens to us when we die you said ""I know that those who love us will miss us"". Beautifully said and thank you for that ❣️

ztqlgb,Why are you the best spider-man? 😁,2023-01-02 00:05:33
ztqlgb,"Hi Tobey, you probably get this all the time but you are genuinely the closest thing I’ve ever had to a childhood hero, all I ever watched lived or breathed was Spider-Man and nothing has ever come close to those films for me. I cannot describe how much it meant to me to see you and Andrew in No Way Home, nearly 15 years later you made me feel like a child again and that feeling hits the same way every time I watch that film. Just wanted to say I absolutely love you and I genuinely think you and your portrayal of Peter Parker is what shaped me into the man I am today and is why I always strive to be a good person any and every way I can. I am over the moon delighted to see you back in the spotlight after a while and you alone sold me on Babylon, I’ll watch literally anything you’re in. Your performance in the Great Gatsby is seriously underrated by the way, not gonna lie I think you outdid Leo in that! 

As for a question, were there any hobbies or side projects that filled up the few years of a break you took from acting? Or was it nice to just live in a bit of solitude? I know you got into competitive puzzling, were there any other interests that kept you active and busy during those few years? I imagine the spotlight from Spider-Man must have gotten incredibly tough after nearly a decade of those films.

Also, what was it like being friends with Q-Tip? Did you ever consider maybe even doing an interlude or a little guest feature on one of his albums? I feel like that would have been an amazing crossover!

(And PLEASE TELL ME YOU’RE COMING BACK AS SPIDER-MAN even for one more rodeo!!!)

Again I just want to say genuinely thank you so so much for being the icon of my childhood and being the standard I set for myself every day, I have looked up to you more than anyone throughout my life and when I think of a hero, the only thing that has or will ever pop into my head is your portrayal of Peter Parker. Sorry the questions aren’t the best, I just would never forgive myself if I didn’t at least try to ask you something.

Whether you respond or not, I wish absolutely nothing but the best for you and only ever hope to see you succeed more and more! You have formed more childhoods than you could ever know and I hope you know how adored and appreciated you are ❤️",2022-12-23 20:33:28
ztqlgb,"Hey Tobey!

I Love You! ❤
You're My Spider-Man (Super Hero) literally since I was born. As a child, I used to watch Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 almost everyday wishing to become a Superhero when I grow up & I was super duper excited for Spider-Man 3 which I watched and loved too. For me, The Raimi Triology is the best Triology ever and Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man is the best character ever! When I saw you in the theaters back as My Spider-Man in No Way Home, I lost my shit. I cheered like anything. It truly made me the happiest person alive. I figured that you have been a constant in my life while very naturally, so much in life has changed but you as my Spider-Man and my love for Spider-Man has remained the same (only increased) since forever. Thank you for everything. You made my childhood and life in general, exciting and helped me make memories for a lifetime ❤ Bless you. 

P.S. Hoping to see you back as my Spider-Man again!",2022-12-24 12:05:13

It's always made me a little uneasy that my hero as a kid is always shown being less than pleasant. However, I also know that the paparazzi are scum. Are you able to comment on this at all? If not, it's understandable. 

Either way, I'm just happy to at least send you a message and it is this. You will always be Spider-Man to me. He was my hero growing up and I always wished I could have great power and use it with great responsibility. Thank you for making that happen. There have been and will be many Spider-Men. But there'll only ever be one friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. With much love. ❤️",2022-12-23 21:00:35

ztqlgb,"Tobey, if you’re reading this, lemme just say from the bottom of my heart and soul, I’d *never* would’ve gotten into Spider-Man if it wasn’t for you! The original 2002 movie is one of my personal favorites of all time, and it still holds up to this day! Your take on Peter Parker is so believably shy and awkward and suffered so much, I always wanted to jump into the screen, give him a big ol’ hug and befriend him straight away! When you put on the iconic red and blue webbed-covered suit, that iconic mask with the ivory-colored lenses, CGI web-swinging the towering buildings of Manhattan always ready to take action at the first sign of trouble, you inspire so many others to become heroes in their own ways! (“There’s a hero in all of us”, spoken by a lovely and strong woman) Your Spidey inspires hope, to never give up in the face of danger and negativity, which is something today’s world desperately needs right now. If Tom Holland is representative of the modern-day Spidey influenced by the Ultimate Marvel comics, your take is the classic ‘60s comic character come to the life on the big screen!

Good sir, even if you currently don’t wear the mask and suit anymore — except in that awe-astounding Multiversal-moment in No Way Home — to me, you will always be *my* classic Peter Parker; to all of us, you will always be our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man! **#ThwipThwip**

Thank you for all my wonderful childhood memories, Mr. Maguire! *Thank you…* 🥹",2022-12-23 22:15:27
ztqlgb,Tobey your spiderman is the spiderman I grew up with your my favorite spiderman actor to ever exist I have a replica of your spiderman 3 red and blue suit and I have all the figures your spiderman was a role model I used growing up I was in my mothers womb when my mom and dad saw the first spiderman and then I went to see the others actually born and I was wondering is there any chance you’ll come back to the role of spiderman after no way home like maybe idk SECRET WARS 👀👀 it would be awesome to see all three of you guys on screen together maybe Tom gets the black suit and you try and tell him to take it off but it ends up in a fight and struggle is there a possibility I must know,2022-12-23 22:39:41
ztqlgb,"Hey Tobey,

I hope you are having a great holiday season and this reaches you in good health! Merry Christmas! Myself and my brother’s first movie we ever saw in theaters was Spider-Man. Hard to believe we were six and four years old then! We saw the second one also in theaters and our whole Family saw the third one in IMAX when that was new and a big deal. I just wanted to say thank you for working really hard to bring Spider-Man to life. Your movies have given us so many great memories especially when you came back as Spidey in No Way Home! Hope you come to a convention near or in Massachusetts sometime. My brother and I still have the first copy of Spider-Man our parents bought us on VHS when we were kids. Would be awesome if you were to sign it and have the opportunity to meet you in person! Would be an honor to shake your hand or fist bump, whatever we are doing these days😂🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️!

Keep up the great work! Congratulations also on Babylon!

Were you excited to come back into your Spider-Man role with Andrew and Tom? Would you be willing to do it again if the opportunity came up?

I never watched any Spider-Man movies, except yours. I was so excited to see you in the movie that I yelled so loud and woke my son up. 
Also, the prank on your wife about misspelling your son’s name was a little funny but she had the calmest reaction you could’ve asked for.

Sorry, my husband knows I love you as an actor and just quickly told me about this thread so he could get me to stop talking to him. 😁",2022-12-23 23:41:29
ztqlgb,"Hi Tobey! My late husband Jeremy LOVED Spider-man and dragged me to your movie when it came out (we were 17 and 19). For some reason, when I was little, I got Spider-man confused with The Fly, so I thought it was going to be scary and gross. I had no idea what I was in for! I LOVED it! If it weren’t for you and Jeremy, I wouldn’t be the Spider-man/superhero loving person I am now. Today (Dec. 23rd) marks exactly 15 years since Jeremy passed away, and I am so glad I trusted him that day at the theater, because these movies have really helped me grieve and heal. I feel connected to him each time (especially when you returned in No Way Home). Thank you for the hope, laughter, and tears. ♥️",2022-12-24 01:45:40

wd47jv,"I worked on an animated film a couple of years ago. We got ""scratch actors"" in to record the first version of the script so that we had something to work on. They were professional voice actors. We had Will Friedle as one and Cree Summer as another. But they were there just to fill in before the parts were cast with ""big name actors"". Will Friedle in particular was hilarious. He brought so much to his temporary role, he added stuff himself that they ended up keeping in the script. And I felt kind of bad for him that he was this good and then they got a live action actor in to just rerecord his lines, and he never got the recognition he deserved for that. His performance was just fantastic. He got to do a couple of incidental voices in the final cut. But he should have been the character that he did the scratch records for. It was also pretty jarring to hear someone else in the final film after Cree had absolutely made that role her own. Now I'm not knocking the final actors, they were good. But I personally feel like Will Friedle and Cree Summer should have played their scratch characters in the final film. I also got super excited when I realised it was Will Friedle. I was a big Boy Meets World fan. I told the directors and anyone else I could find that day to tell them that OH MY GOD ERIC FROM BOY MEETS WORLD IS DOING THE SCRATCH!

77helj,"Dear Mr. Guillermo, 

I just wanted to say how much I love and am grateful for your creations. You are one of the many reasons I am glad to be alive at this time in history.  Because you create new worlds and characters that reflect reality in such a powerful, but understated way. Because you have followed your heart to write and direct, this world is a better and more interesting place to live in. 

I was 16 when I went to see my first R-Rated movie. It was midnight, the opening night of Pan's Labyrinth and knew nothing about the movie. When I got there, the theater was close to empty, which I thought was odd.

But when the movie began, I was entranced.  I didn't expect this movie to combine history and fantasy in such a sublime way. I didn't know it would be so violent and terrifying. I didn't expect Ophelia's innocence and vulnerability to bring me to tears and make me wish I could reach in and rescue her. 

Seeing this movie full of violence, kindness, and bravery changed me as a person. I decided that people who refused or didn't like to watch subtitles, were stupid and didn't know what amazing art they were missing out on. I have felt empowered to write, even if I can't seem to do it well. Seeing that movie on my own was basically the first ""grown-up"" thing I had ever done. And it's a precious memory. Pan's Labyrinth will always have a special place in my heart.  

It is not the only film that I love, however. The Devil's Backbone is another personal favorite and masterpiece.  Pretty anything you have written, as well as directed, blows my mind.

You never go overboard. Everything is tastefully understated, but powerful. 

My only hope is that you continue to follow your unique aesthetic, your muse in creating more and more art. Whether they are movies, books, illustrations, virtual reality, open world games,  or poetry....  Please keep creating more and more. 

I am a huge fan of Pablo Neruda and Federico Garcia Lorco, by the way, so I am really hoping you also publish poetry one day. Because knowing what a beautiful mind and heart you have through your work makes me certain that you also write poetry. ☺️ 

I try not to see trailers or read synopses for your movies anymore. Because I love the surprise and experience of finding out on my own. I have only seen posters for The Shape of Water. I wonder what it will be like when I finally get to see it. Is it a moral tale? Will there be great love and suffering? Will there be tenderness and faith? All these questions just from a poster.... It's driving me crazy. 

I can't wait to find out!

Upon further inspection, Cho discovers that the dying moose is pregnant. He performs open heart surgery on the side of the road in the middle of the night in Alaska, and then helps mama moose give birth. Successfully. Turns out mama moose had migrated from Mexico looking for a better life for her moose children. John went out his way to plan, organize, and execute a coupe d’état of the local government in order to make sure that mama moose could live happily ever after.

ahahahahahha I'm fucking weakkk🤣

u really used the girl that showed up in the series exactly [2 episodes](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1137209/?ref_=tt_cl_t12)

> Lucy

I would say ""touché"" but i remember that shit shoehorned so badly just for a crappy subplot for ""Tom"" (if he's indian why does he even have a white name lmfaooo)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

> Tom is problematic because of his douchebro, misogynistic attitude

Yeah all characters that are meant to be haten are portrayed like this 

which makes me wonder why Tom was portrayed as this out of the whole shitcast?

ironic too cuz most old fat white men that are obsessed with guns and meat are usually racist and *yet* in the show, Ron is portrayed like he's a feminist ahahah give me a break

that's probably the best joke writted the whole series!!🤣

> It’s like you saw one episode a few years ago and are basing this on your memory of it. 

Nah finish it all the way to the end on Netflix 


(surprisingly given how shit it is but i guess i enjoyed in my younger more ignorant years, as u kids r)

dwvtt3,I sure got downvoted to Oblivion for asking what was wrong though. The original comment I responded too says that being a good movie is not important for being nominated for best film and it references black panther which implies that it was a bad movie. I simply asked a question of what was wrong with it. Idk why that's a question worthy of being downvoted.  It was just a simple question 😂 but seeing the likes his comment received and the downvotes I got it would seem people generally thought it was a bad film. To which I still just want to know .. what exactly was wrong with it? Why do redditors not like black panther?  Like dang I asked a simple question not said heil Hitler lol.,2019-11-16 05:34:08

Especially after enduring so much. Years of experiencing what he had to go through…… only to get back up, dust himself off, then take a cue from George Forman, in a Cinderella story of, not merely **returning** to an industry known for forgetting people, before they even have both feet, out the door, but for absolutely **EXPLODING** back into the stratosphere of greatness and popularity, taking no time, at all, to reach the benchmark, of all acting benchmarks, earning the apogee of accolades, that any, truly great actor could tell you, is the sort of triumph that is, **FAR** **FROM** guaranteed.

Your first movie, your shows and the other movies Sacha has made have helped me through so many hard times in my life.  As a Jew (and a psychotherapist) I understand the humor from a deep, soul level.  Sacha’s intelligence, humor and social activism have inspired me since 2001! I actually met you (Borat) in Los Angeles at Barnes Noble in 2007 and gave you a letter. There’s no way you would remember that, but thank you for taking it and taking a photo with me, even though you weren’t supposed to take photos 🥰 I also have no idea what I wrote in the letter because it was so long ago, but I’m sure it had to do with how much I’ve adored you and how much you’ve helped me!  I loved your new movie and how it was more overtly feminist.  Thank you for your lovely portrayal of the Jewish women and the African American woman... I know where your heart is and what you wrote your thesis on.  Also Maria is phenomenal and your connection with Tutar made me cry!!

God damn, did he get Toxic on me after that. 

I try to explain him how I was white people that made the church it was white people that started the crusade it was white people that were Nazis as white people that started almost all the wars it's white people that did this is white people that made the nuclear bombs Charles Manson was a white person all the most vicious serial killers for white people the zodiac killer was a white person. 

I'm not going to get started with him about why MGTOW, Has to Exist. 

The more proof I gave that white people were not Superior being that we are not Angels incarnated on the earth and black people are not demons, the more toxic and aggressive he got and the other people did as well. 

He also referred them to a certain group of animals on the Earth that I will not be addressing to you, he also had a strong hatred of the Jews ?

u27agl,"I met Gilbert Gottfried through his wife and daughter not realizing the connection given their last names. What a wonderful and loving wife, daughter, and son (even though he was going nuts for attention, he’s the youngest) he left behind. His wife was just as hilarious as him, and when she showed me the science project they needed my help editing, I realized who she was given the narration was Gilbert himself talking about the African Chimpanzees. I was lucky enough to meet his entire family and him eventually (when he got home from being out).

I am a fan of his work, but I’m much more sad that a lovely family right now is broken and hurting. I’m sure they’ll never see this, but all the love to them in their time of grieving ♥️. 

Rest In Peace, thanks for your kindness Gilbert.",2022-04-12 23:15:25

Your first movie, your shows and the other movies Sacha has made have helped me through so many hard times in my life.  As a Jew (and a psychotherapist) I understand the humor from a deep, soul level.  Sacha’s intelligence, humor and social activism have inspired me since 2001! I actually met you (Borat) in Los Angeles at Barnes Noble in 2007 and gave you a letter. There’s no way you would remember that, but thank you for taking it and taking a photo with me, even though you weren’t supposed to take photos 🥰 I also have no idea what I wrote in the letter because it was so long ago, but I’m sure it had to do with how much I’ve adored you and how much you’ve helped me!  I loved your new movie and how it was more overtly feminist.  Thank you for your lovely portrayal of the Jewish women and the African American woman... I know where your heart is and what you wrote your thesis on.  Also Maria is phenomenal and your connection with Tutar made me cry!! Sorry that I’m addressing Borat and Sacha in this same post, its confusing to go back and forth and I hope it all tracks.",2020-10-27 20:31:02

g2gqgc,"I remember seeing an interview with Cruise telling a story on how he got sick a lot while flying during training for Top Gun. At one point he got sick, bent down to vomit in a bag and at the same time the pilot started doing a loop, which means a lot of downwards g-force. So Cruise was basically folded in two with his face pressed against the bag with the vomit and no way to sit up straight until the loop was done. And when it was finally done he was pissed and asked the pilot ""HEY didn't you see I was sick back here??"" to which the pilot just smirked and said ""yep"". Something like that, wish I could find the interview.

So I bought a pair of Harry Potter swimming trunks a couple of years ago. I went to put them on this summer and realized I had gained so much weight that I couldn’t fit in them anymore, and was genuinely upset. I got *so* many compliments when I would wear them.

I’m not sure how much weight I’ve lost, but it should be around 25-30 pounds. I decided to try them on this morning when I woke up because we are going swimming tomorrow and they fucking fit. So now I’m back to a couple of dumbass oilfield tattoos (and a lot of other various tattoos and sleeves), but can also fit in my beloved Harry Potter trunks.

e1ylut,"The problem with studio owned theaters is exclusivity. 

Right now the way the industry works is simple: theater has 10 houses and calls distributor and requests 10 prints (I know it's mostly digital now, whatever I'm old school) of the newest releases. You would have a solid mix of production studios. MGM, Sony, Disney, Paramount, Universal, Fox, whatever. The theater rents those movies for a few thousand dollars per week. I don't know what the costs are now but back in the day each print ranged from $1000-$3000/week depending on the film. So a ten house theater generally averaged about $20k/week in rental costs on the films. Fun! So ticket prices get jacked up because they need to cover the cost. Sucks. But, we have the choice of what to see. 

With the studio owned theaters you'll likely get no choice. Only MGM. Or Disney. Or whatever. Now that one movie you want to see, it's not playing at every theater, it's only playing at the Sony owned theater 20 miles away. If you want to watch 'Cars 9', 'Toy Story 13', 'Marvel Movie 60', 'Star Wars Movie: Baby Yoda hears a Who' or whatever, v you can go to the 30 Disney®™ owned theaters near you. But let's say that the studios won't be exclusive (yeah fucking right) with the theaters. Let's say they'll ""allow"" competitors to show their films. You can sure as fucking bet they won't be renting those films. They'll charge the competitor studio to show their movie in their theater. Because now they are not just a competitor, they're the distribution channel. 

If you don't think Disney is going to be the first one to buy up AMC, MJR, CGC (are they still around?) Emagine, Star, or whatever major theater chains, you're sadly mistaken. They can control the distro, bleed the other studios dry, buy them up and control the IPs. Now we have only Disney. All hail the house of mouse! This is the direction we are heading. This is bad for anyone that likes movies. No good comes of studios owning theaters. Except that maybe they'll pull their heads out of their asses and work with Netflix to combat the Mouse Eared Juggernaut.",2019-11-26 18:02:09

nofv1b,Tenet:👀,2021-05-31 10:53:34
nofv1b,"Depending on the equipment you have, there might be adjustments that can help mitigate the difference between the loudest and softest point of a show or movie.  Most TVs have an “auto volume” setting or something similar in the sound menu to help even out the audio.  In home theater receivers there’s “dynamic range compression” which does the same thing.  Sound bars that are around middle tier and up have a similar feature too.  Take a dive into your settings and look for these settings which may help out.  Also noted, TV speakers are terrible at reproducing the original audio for a show or movie.  I cannot tell you how many times I rewatched an old movie, like the Lethal Weapon series, and heard things I never noticed before after I bought my Sonos Playbar.  Night and day difference.  If you want to get the most out of your viewing, remember that audio is just as, if not, more important than the video.  If you can, upgrade your audio equipment.  I prefer Sonos because their true play is great at calibrating the audio to any room and their build quality is awesome.

Hope this helps out some people here!

And yes, inaudible dialogue is criminal and I hate it too.😎",2021-05-31 12:34:30
nofv1b,"Yeah it's dumb. I think it stems from the ""MoViEs ShOuLD bE wAtChEd iN a ThEaTrE 😤"" types. A lot of film makers have that mentality. Cause in like a theatre, you can have it as loud as you need. And if your home has a home theatre set up, the same. You have roomates or thin walls, watching on like a phone, you're kinda f-ed. Thought it's not just movies for me. A lot of TV is the same. Breaking Bad has this problem iirc.

Or maybe this is the reason they have an Oscar for sound mixing. It's harder than it seems and not all filmmakers can manage it. Though maybe I should go back and review all those nominees see how many of them actually had good sound.",2021-05-30 22:53:18

It makes it very difficult to see the emotion and facial expressions the actor or actress is trying to convey. Which completely ruins the movie or show.

uyb024,"TLDR, met him backstage a little drunk at a concert and helped walk him to his limo. 

Kind of a funny story…met him when I was 16 after my friend and I snuck back stage at a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert. It was an outdoor venue and stage was up this big hill, the concert ends and somehow we still hadn’t got caught (this was early 2000’s) when my friend spots him and says “holy f*ck that’s the guy from goodfellas!”

It was our fav movie so I walked up, asked if he was Ray Liotta - of course it was,  can’t really mistake him for anyone else haha - and just said how big of a fan I was of him. He said thank you and all that and as I was about to walk away he put his arm around my shoulder and then his entire body weight onto me and asked if we could help walk him to his limo. He, uhh, must’ve had a little too much to drink that night and needed help down the hill 😂😂

So for about 15 mins walking through a crowd of people my friend and I had Ray Liotta on our shoulders chatting about high school, sports, fav bands, music, etc. it was surreal.  We got to his limo said goodbye and he plopped in and went on his way. 

My friend and I were so giddy we went straight home and put the goodfellas dvd in and watched it till like 3am.  

Anyway, thought that would make some of y’all laugh a bit. He was not just a great actor but a truly good and down to earth person as well.

I was making a smoothie and a big sweaty man with a big Dunkin’ iced coffee walked in and I was like holyfickingshit it’s ray liotta. He was really nice and kinda funny and gross, I remember him being REALLY sweaty. 

We had massive ground level windows in our place and he asked me how I masturbated in the apartment without everyone seeing 😂😂",2022-05-26 17:43:49

7d49bs,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Deadpool. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Wade's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Deadpool truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Wade's existential catchphrase “Chimichangas,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ryan Reynold's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Deadpool tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2017-11-15 15:20:44

I mean how long did we have to fight for a rated r deadpool movie? Which opened up the gateway to the rated r wolverine film, I still wish venom was rated r, but we will get there. You completely missed my point. I'm not saying Ryan Reynolds is going out there and doing never before seen experimental films he's just doing fun films that people want to watch and Hollywood most likely wouldnt have funded if he wasnt tied to the project. 🤷🏽‍♂️ but to each their own.

(I skipped a bunch of lines because I realize that the following text is not very well written. Not even sure that there’s a point to it)
Before everyone starts to rail on me, know that I’m saying this with limited knowledge on the subject(s) and it’s an opinion based on my perception of the little facts that I can remember, but I would have to open a whole new tab, maybe even two, to verify this, and I’m not gonna, on account that its too much work, but feel free to correct me... if you dare:

I was hoping that someone would do something like this soon and it makes me extra happy that it was Quentin Tarantino who did. I read some comments and I don’t want to say that this is being undermined, but I don’t know if his actions are being given the praise that they truly deserve, which should be enormous. We should let this man have all the feet he could ever wish for and more. He, alone, (the people at Sony were probably going apeshit about this) had the balls to stand up to China and not submit to their petty intolerance. He did what neither, Marvel Studios (kind of), nor the NBA and Lebron James (a lot), had the balls to do. I have nothing against these two, or 3, institutions or the people of China, but it was discouraging to see how quickly they gave in, and for what? Money? I’m all about respecting other cultured and what not, but to demand that they change a scene, that I can only assume means a lot to him (as does the whole movie), or they won’t allow the screening of the film, is way beyond entitlement. And I’m not even really talking about the just movie. The real issue transcends all of this nonsense. I’m talking about their blatant violation of human rights. They are a fucked up government and now they’re trying to impose their will on everyone else and expect the world to adapt to them? Even if it is within their own borders, it’s not right. It’s even more fucked when you consider that they’ve been successful at it so far. I’m not saying that the US is perfect by any means, but at least there are still several basic rights that we have (other countries too) and will continue to have and I can’t imagine how sad life would be without (e.g. freedom of speech, there’s others). I’m sure that this won’t make much sense, but I’m tired. I didn’t get much sleep last night, but I wanted to say something and show my respect to a man who did something that very few would do. I don’t even know that I would. I like to think so, but then again, I’ve never been, and probably won’t ever be in that position. 
Thank you for setting such an admirable example of bravery by standing up against the forces of evil. I have a new level of respect for this man and I think that it is well deserved. I hope that at least some of you feel the same way. Is this an overreaction? It’s highly possible that it is. Or maybe it isn’t. Who’s to say? I will leave you with an overused quote by some person whose name I forget (would have to open another tab to find out and I can’t do that. I either read it in a Garfield comic or it was Kevin Alfred Einstein): “To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.” Wooooaaaah. Heavy stuff. Okay. I think that’s it. Don’t forget to wash your pee pees and your poopies. I love you 😘

PS:  Feel free to call me out or tell me why I’m wrong, just don’t get angry. Do it as if Mr. Tarantino were watching you, because he always is.",2020-01-15 20:20:51

113zdzt,My heart goes out to him and his family. It is such a debilitating disease. I would like to thank him here for all of the entertaining movie/television/musical moments he has given us over the years. His album The Return of Bruno is one of my favorites.

113zdzt,"My grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's when I was like 10. By the time I was 15 she and my grandpa were living with us, as he was dying of cancer and she wasn't capable of being a caretaker anymore. When he died, the trauma kicked her back to her childhood and she thought it was her grandpa who had died. For a few weeks she still remembered who we were to some extent, but after a couple months she was introducing my mom as an old friend from college. 

Unfortunately, due to her family genetics there's about a 60% chance my mom and aunts are going to also experience early onset Alzheimer's, and that likely extends to myself and my siblings as well. It's a nasty disease and the experience of having someone who was your caretaker for a lot of your childhood completely forget who you are sticks with you for the rest of your life.

I do mind that everything pretty much went back to normal a few weeks after that insane war. Like what the flipping fuck. Cersi should have been burned by the fucking dragon. Danny or Jon should have came out to a thunderous roar as the new king. I can never get that shit ending out of my head. It ruined RUINED a great story.

pkxa0k,I keep seeing the new Matrix movie trailer and I can't get John Wick outta my head by how he looks. It would be cool if for the new Matrix movie when Neo is talking to to the therapist saying he keeps having dreams they should show flash backs. And in those flash backs it should be John Wick flashbacks. Tie those two franchises to together. Lol  That's why John Wick was such a bad ass and no one could kill him.  And the wife that dies in John Wick was Trinity.  But didn't technically die she just went back INTO the Matrix. So that's why he doesn't recognize her when he sees her. 😆,2021-09-13 01:04:52

pkxa0k,"Something feels OFF about this trailer. It doesn't have that matrix feel. The teaser was much better. No Fishburne is a huge letdown. Reaves acting in the previous installments did not blow me away, it was Fishburne who made it feel like I was in the Matrix. On top of that, you cast a character that looks and acts just like him? And bring back Trinity who died? I don't care if Morphues died in Matrix Online, who gives a shit, if you can bring back Trinity and Neo you can bring back Morpheus. I wonder if Fishburne has made some transphobic comments in the past that led to Lana outing him on this sequel?🤔 I also hope this movie doesn't go the Woke SJW route either.  I'm still going to watch it opening day, and I want it to do good. But damn, no Fishburne is a huge letdown. It's a disrespect to the fans.

Queer doesn't just mean gay, but the first one is gay as fuck.

It makes me really disturbed seeing someone (and their spouse be a part of) a foundation for finding women subjected to sex trafficking while protecting a fucking rapist. I get they worked together YOUNG during That 70s Show, I always try to see the other side; there’s a naivety to it always, especially that young. Is it nostalgia? My thought process is logical. That’s not disregarding anything done right now AT ALL. As an adult, your frontal lobe is FULLY developed. I’m not a scientist, I’m not trying to turn this into a science debate. BUT as a fucking young woman seeing this shit, it makes me fucking sick.. Thats an understatement. A FUCKING understatement. Ashton and Mila went to his birthday party RECENTLY. I really wonder if Mila ever had problems with Masterson, since she was only secretly sixteen when she managed to acquire a position in the cast of That 70s Show. Sorry for my long paragraph, I’m bad at speaking in person, but when it comes to writing I’m a whole other being. Thanks! -Tae :-)

l652sd,"My interest is now piqued for this movie. Kristen looks so good as Diana!!😳

[Synopsis via Deadline:](https://deadline.com/2021/01/kristen-stewart-princess-diana-first-look-timothy-spall-sally-hawkins-1234681276/)

>About a weekend in the early ‘90s when Diana decided her marriage to Prince Charles wasn’t working, and that she needed to veer from a path that had put her in line to one day be queen. The drama takes place over three days, in one of her final Christmas holidays in the House of Windsor in their Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England.

Kristen Stewart on the movie:

>*Spencer* is a dive inside an emotional imagining of who Diana was at a pivotal turning point in her life. It is a physical assertion of the sum of her parts, which starts with her given name; Spencer. It is a harrowing effort for her to return to herself, as Diana strives to hold onto what the name Spencer means to her.",2021-01-27 14:10:48

It's fucking awesome. I'm a lil high so maybe it's that but I'm finding these gags to be fucking hilarious. This dude is so unfortunate haha


when he fucking throws the wood and it goes over the other end 😂 or just the way he manhandles the chick, it's so fucking funny. Just straight stuffs her into a bag then watches helplessly as they toss stuff on her. Man that's great. And the little things like losing his shoe in a pile of shoes he just emptied lol It's so jam packed! I feel like this is me on those days where I'm trying really hard for everything to go great but the little things just keep fucking up 


oh and idk why but the fact that he chooses to slide into scenes at times just floors me. It's so funny Idk why but I've replayed those bits over and over. So yeah, this is awesome, thanks. Gonna show it to my buddies I think they'll love it

that dude is so expressive, what a contrast to Keaton. I find it interesting that they chose to add ambient and machine audio but not dialogue. I'm gonna take a stab and guess that it's because they didn't have recording equipment that they could use on set but foley and musical recordings were possible. That or they chose to commit to the silent film while livening up the footage a bit. Either, great stuff, really great stuff. Thank again",2018-02-07 02:07:40

I tried guessing but that just frustrated him more.   This man clearLy knew in his head what he wanted to say but could not put the word/words together.

So, I was kinda surprised by how much the new movie was really just a repeat of the original movie. I guess I really thought it would strike out on its own path and take more inspiration from the book. But it didn’t. 

The visuals were amazing. The Paul casting is a bit odd but he’s a good actor so I guess I get it. The Jessica casting is a million times better than the original movie. 

I also recently went back and listened to the first several books as audiobooks. The did not hold up well. We’re better in my memory than reality. 🤷🏻‍♀️",2023-04-27 16:19:27

My fondest memory was turning to him after the return of the king and asking whether it was anything like the novels and it was so nice how much joy I could see in my dads face when he said it’s everything I thought it would be and so much more 🥰 now we frequently do lotr marathons and last year we were planning a trip to NZ but of course covid hit so will postpone.

I get back from my Christmas vacation, and every single member was now breathlessly asking - and judging you - on how many times you’d seen it. It truly was a miracle for us, to be bitter nerds and given this gift by visionary nerds. To us it was perfect, because it had been impossible days before.

My other Fellowship story is actually seeing the film that Christmas break with my mom. We’re getting to the point where Sam chases down Frodo, Boromir is dead, and she leans over to whisper:

qdt7w4," This will undoubtedly get buried amongst the thousands (!) of other comments, but I have to get it off my chest:

There is a lot of blame being thrown around, but in no way is the actor responsible for this tragedy. **Filmmaking is a collaborative effort**, with each person contributing their expertise to the position they were hired for. Actors are hired because they are good at pretending, at playing make-believe — and nothing more. The clothes they wear are designed and built by experts in costume design and construction – and nothing more. The scenery they act within are built by carpenters who are experts in set construction - and nothing more. And so on, for every department from sound to props to catering.

***The entire organization and structure of a film shoot (or stage play, or concert) is based upon the presumption of mutual trust.***
The dancer in a ballet feels comfortable and confident entering the stage for her big solo precisely because she trusts that her colleagues in the lighting department have rigged the lights above her correctly such that they won’t fall down and kill her. She only needs to focus on her performance, nothing else. 
The opera singer only has to worry about hitting those high notes at the end of her aria, not about the quality of construction in the platform she is standing upon.

It is patently absurd to propose that somebody in one department (the “talent”, actor in this case) should double-check the work done by another department (props / armory in this case). 
Yes, guns are super dangerous and need to be treated with extreme care and diligence. 
The same is true of the pyro you see at rock concerts. The same is true of the kamikaze cars whizzing by Tom Cruise in a Mission Impossible flick.

And just as with the ballerina and opera singer examples, the guitarist in the band doesn’t worry about all the flames and flash pots going off around him, *because he trusts his crew not to kill him*. He doesn’t check whether the pyro was set up correctly - that’s not his job, nor should it be for very good reasons. All he needs to concentrate on is nailing his big guitar solo coming up.

We don’t expect Tom Cruise to check the readiness of the stunt cars before they are driven at high speed inches away from his face. *Because he trusts in the professionalism of everyone on set around him.*

In the stage musical Peter Pan, do you think that actor checks that all of the carabiners on his harness are oriented and locked before the famous scene in which he flies over the audience? Of course not, that would be absurd. We hire specialists like Flying By Foy® whose sole and entire job is to take responsibility for the safe operation of the flying rig. 

We set up these procedures and protocols in order to free the performer from the responsibility of anything other than their performance. To demand differently is to reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of the way films are made, concerts are produced, plays and operas and dances are presented.

It strikes me as the height of arrogance for any of us to apply the standards or rules from another industry onto this one. Comments like, “well they shouldn’t call it a ‘live round’ if it’s actually a blank”, or all these armchair firearms experts righteously proclaiming that it’s the actor’s responsibility to inspect the props they are given before using them.

Excuse me, but there are good reasons why certain terms are used, terms which have evolved through hundreds of thousands of film shoots in over 100 years of refinement. And as I outlined above, there are good reasons why performers are not expected to check the work of others before performing. I’m sitting here imagining how that would (not) play out, lol.

Just because the nomenclature is confusing to you, or the safety protocols sound insanely insufficient to you, does not mean they are wrong or inappropriate in this context, for this industry. A film set is not a firing range, nor is it a branch of the military, nor any of the other things people here are comparing it to. It is it’s own special little world, replete with all sorts of things that wouldn’t make sense in the real world. Yet they make perfect sense in the context of a film shoot.

Every industry has tools / procedures / terms that are unique to that field, but make no sense to the rest of us. I have no idea how the mining industry works, but hey if they want to call their drill bits “carrots” or whatever, who am I to say they are wrong if that term works well for all of them.

The industry has good safety protocols in place, witness the thousands of films and shows made each year using “live” rounds (blanks in real guns). This shoot was a monumental clusterfuck on so many levels, but it’s making headlines precisely because the accidental death is so extremely rare. As several people in the business have commented elsewhere in this thread, when guns are used as props on a film shoot there are strict rules that are followed to ensure safety for everyone while also allowing for the realism the director envisions.

Clearly many of these protocols were not followed on this shoot. Several layers of safety procedures were breached, from the armorer not being present at the handoff of the gun, to the AD behaving in clear violation of his own well-known firearms safety procedures, to the same gun continuing to be used that had misfired (twice! or was it 3x?) earlier in the week. I have no doubt all of this is being thoroughly investigated and charges will be brought if and when it’s appropriate. But please don’t condemn the working procedures of an entire industry you have no experience in. In turn, we shall refrain from doing the same to your field of expertise.

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk!",2021-10-24 12:07:45

>Series creator Dan Harmon is writing the film with former series scribe Andrew Guest (whose credits include fan-favorite episodes “Advanced Dungeons & Dragons” and “A Fistful of Paintballs”). They’ll executive-produce alongside McHale, Russ Krasnoff and Gary Foster. The movie is slated to be released in 2023.  


>Plot details are being kept under wraps for now. The press release only states that Community the Movie derives “from the TV series that predicted its own movie,” making it “the least predictable movie of a TV series that referenced a lot of movies and TV.”

Despite what the article says, Glover and Brown are both likely coming back, McHale tagged them in his [post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjIkyLzLdKk/?hl=en).

[Brown](https://twitter.com/YNB/status/1575860430429298688) tweeted!

csfo0b,"I get what u are saying but a lot of films have twists at the end, they subvert ur expectations, a script writer obviously wants to keep an audience guessing, if it all ends up like u want it to its a Disney Movie, that u enjoy but dont think much about it afterwards...we say we want a film to end a certain way but wen it doesn't we usually contemplate the ending afterwards and realise we enjoyed it and if not we spend time thinking about it or discussing it.. I really think u should always be ready for a twist at the end of any movie so saying this equates to reveiling spoilers is a very untrue statement...thats my two cents anyway bro😁",2019-08-20 01:10:09

kf5pii,"I met Jeremy Bulloch about 9 years ago, at a convention in France. Back when I was a kid, out of all the original star wars cast, Boba Fett's character was hands down the one who intrigued me the most and pretty much my favorite. Somehow I always prefered the villains in theses stories haha, probably because of their aura of mystery and deadly charisma, gotta say the jedi and rebels (and ewoks, sigh) seemed so cheesy in comparison I kind of thought they were ridiculous. Growing up, It actually reversed and I started liking and rooting for the the good guys. Vader was cool and all, but Boba was cooler. His iconic lone ranger style, and his roughed up armor telling untold tales captivated me, as well as his helmet design which I grew extremely fond of. He was that guy you can't cross, and he didnt really take orders from anyone, actually a vicious bastard really 😂.  Granted he wasn't very loquacious, so there wasn't much I could hold onto but I guess it made him even more memorable as my imagination did the rest haha. I remember being incredibly excited (and consequently very shy)  to meet my favorite character in person and Mr Bulloch struck me as an really kind man. He looked like some cheerful grandpa and greeted me and my mum warmly. He then told us that he was really enjoying his stay in Paris and about that football match he had watched the night before (or he was going to watch) with his favorite team. I couldn't understand everything so my mother was translating for me, but he seemed so genuine and actually happy to be there meeting his fans, it was quite heartwarming to see, especially considering waiting all day to sign 3000 books, helmets and posters probably gets old pretty fast. He did sign my poster though, we took a few pictures together, and it was an awesome memory really.  😊 To think we waited all these years to finally have a Mandalorian TV show !

(I was kid then) my parents found a furniture for sale ad in the Desert Sun newspaper at a country club in Rancho Mirage. Turns out it was Estelle and her husband selling all of their furniture before moving out to Los Angeles. We bought her bed (parents bed) husband’s bed (my bed) and a few wooden dressers. She had so much to sell that she even told us to invite family from out of town to buy. They bought two, 4 foot tall bronze lions and other more flashy furniture/items. She was so nice, bubbly and encouraging us to buy more hahaha. She even gave us her new LA number when ever we felt like visiting but my parents lost it. 🙄 It was the second time visiting her when we were taking things back to our home is when it hit me she was Mrs. Potatohead.

bkz3bj,"Yet? It was mid-day for me, I posted here during my lunch break.

Anyway, first there's the question I see a lot of people have asked. Maybe I was too uninterested in the film to pay attention whether or not they provided an answer, but how the heck did Cap get to that bench? If he went back he should have ended up on the portal device. He couldn't possibly have went back slightly earlier than when the others Arrived because the movie already established that past and present operate in different universes. He can go back to the present or he can't go back at all.

Next, according to the movie you need these fancy red tubes and suits to travel in time, but for some some reason Nebula can bring back Thanos, his ship along with the entire crew without any of this? Not to mention she somehow knows how to operate the portal? One could guess that Thanos and his people are so advanced that they don't need those things to travel in time. Fair enough, but even then there is the question of why he even bothered to go back and attack them in the first place: 

Past Nebula brings Past Thanos to the present. According to their logic this should not define the future for Past Thanos, but rather create an alternate universe. So as Past Thanos brought to the future (our present) becomes Present Thanos 2.0, he should also be able to access the present's past. Meaning that Nebula could simply have allowed Past Thanos to travel alone to the future (movie's present), then back to that timeline's past before he destroyed the stones, then Back to the Future™ again aaaaand [he'd win](https://imgur.com/FRLFr6s). It would take him like 5 seconds in the movie's present, meaning it would be impossible for the Avengers to stop him. 

Lastly, it makes no sense that Tony has his own gauntlet, didn't they say a couple movies ago that it was made with special materials or whatever and was pretty much impossible to recreate? Let's say smart guy figured it out, how the heck did he make one in 1 night? Or did he casually predict the entire outcome of the war beforehand saying ""oh shit I gotta make that glove""?",2019-05-06 15:38:58

- Get Netflix and Hotstar to broadcast the movie.

Kevin spacey, Bill Clinton, and epstine took a trip together to Africa back in the early 2000's. So two known pedophiles and an ex president that has a very troubled sexual past and took around 26 flights on Epstines plane (lolita express) are all just chillin together and you arent suspicious about the people who fly on that plane?

6yakju,"Oh for reals? I didn't know that. Thanks for letting me know. I did just look it up and it seems that you are correct. 

I hope the films includes the fact that he was a bisexual as they don't get a lot of coverage, especially bisexual men. A lot of people just think gay or straight, one or the other. And lot of people seem to associate bisexuality more with women than men. 

Obviously it would have been a huge part of his identity and I hope that they portray that properly as sexuality is an important part of who someone is. It needs to be represented for both Freddies legacy and also for other bisexual people who are underrepresented in society. 

Wasn't meaning to turn this political but I am a huge LGBTQI ally and I think having role models in the public domain really help people who are discovering their sexuality to be confident and proud of who they are. Due to this I think it would be a shame for that not to play an important part in the film, as it clearly did in his life - especially in the era where homosexuality and bisexuality was a lot less accepted than it is now.

But I do believe that even now a lot of society still views bisexuality as mainly for women and like you said, as a gay man who can't or won't accept who they are. When the reality of that is certainly not the case.

I can't even imagine the struggles you went through trying to form your own identity when you had no representation to help you work out what was going on or to understand who you were. And like you said, even in shows etc that had gay characters, bisexuality is usually only referred to as being ""a phase"" someone had at some point in their lives, which is ridiculous.

I live in Australia and we're currently about to have a postal vote on the topic of same sex marriage. I am all for it, but the postal vote has been an awful way to go about it. It's given idiots a platform to spew their hatred. And even sensible people who I would think would support it have been making idiotic statements like ""why does it have to be marriage, why not a civil union"". I hate to think of the effect that this is having on the younger generations who are struggling with their identity. Love is love, why is that so hard to understand? The government has no right to state how two consenting adults who want to spend their lives together are able to do so. It's utter nonsense. 

I am thrilled to hear that you have found your identity and I hope that things like this film will portray Freddie as a role model for those who are in a similar situation to how you once were. He was loved because of who he was and what he did, not because of who he loved. And it was a time where the LGBT+ community weren't as accepted and must have been incredibly difficult for him, especially being in the spotlight as he was.

I can't imagine the struggles you have been through. I never had to come out to my family or anyone else as straight so I find it absurd that anyone else has to. Once would be difficult, so I cant even imagine how hard twice must have been. But it sounds like they love you for you which is incredibly important for your own sense of self and happiness. But it's also people like you that have paved the way for the younger generation to find their identity and love themselves for it. As I said earlier, love is love.

As a brown person it means a lot to me that people like me are represented in society and in the media now as they never were when I was growing up and I struggled with who I was because of that. I think it's equally as important for all 'minorities' in society to have representation. But I truely hope they use this opportunity to tell his story to those who don't know it. I know and like queen and I didn't know he was bisexual. So let's shout it to the world and give you the representation you very clearly deserve in the world.

Keep on keeping on my friend 💕

mhfrk5,"Don't kill me for this, but I thought it was the best and most interesting one of the three new ones, in terms of a quality Star Wars film. It brought a lot of cool ideas to the table, and the cinematography was really great. That being said, that's a very low hurdle to conquer, and the story across all 3 made no sense with the back and forth, so I can understand how Rian Johnson derailing the story pissed off a lot of people. I don't get the hate though, because I honestly had a good time with that one. 🤷‍♂️ I'm not about to disparage anyone for a difference of opinion about Star Wars though, I just wish they had made Ep 9 a good movie. It was depressing to watch, though I am always happy for more Star Wars in any form. Even if I am disappointed. Especially after a childhood filled with rumors and a vast extended universe that took an incredible amount of time to wrap my head around. It's cool to get more mainstream stuff when all the new stories used to be relegated to obscure corners.

I say this as a Star Wars fan of 29 years (got the VHS tapes when I was 6 from my dad, went and saw the PT on midnight opens) But... I also liked the Matrix Reloaded and the ideas it brought to the table before being incredibly disappointed that they never made a third one. 😎",2021-04-01 00:33:07

THEN one day he bought a really scary clown mask and outfit and walked around outside in our backyard (we also lived next to a cemetery) and my mom pretended she couldn't see him (like in the movie). So she told us to come look outside. My dad then ran up on us full speed on our patio, I legit climbed up my mom and peed my pants. I was 7, if that. Still gonna see this remake though.

Yea, *totally* different than if you replaced him with Adolf….. 🤔 

If you can’t call art objective anything, why do critics exist? How do you think artist get better or, if you’ve ever learned the word, EVOLVE???

Have you ever heard of a concept called yin/yang? I think we were taught it in 2nd grade…..

You can’t know what’s good if you don’t know what’s bad 

Therefore, art is OBJECTIVELY, NOT subjective…..

If it was, The Mona Lisa would have zero value attached to it, and Da Vinci would have never been Da Vinci, if he or any other universally famous “artists” thought art was “subjective”

Now is when you reply with some liberal hypocrisy…..

Once again, for the rest of y’all in the back; the entire point of being an “artist” is to EVOLVE, and to achieve greater and greater feats of ART. Whether it’s music, painting, drawing, architecture, athletics, etc….

If it was for any other reason, or according to you, “just to do it”, since that’s what saying “art is subjective” boils down too, what would that lead too? 

Oh I know, it would lead to the current music Holocaust we are all living in currently….

Current music, and pop music (rap music) is objectively getting worse and worse, and devolving into literal shit 

That’s what happens when you allow anybody and everyone, the access to make their own art, and put it out into the world 

You end up with an ocean of shit, you have to sift through, to find the gold.

Unlike how it was the entire time beforehand, which was having only the ones with any “talent” able to be put out into the world

mjxmmn,"Well, when nothing else is on and we've watched everything else...

I'm not a Godzilla fan, but the last one was at least watchable. The CGI in this version was just awful. Why did the humans bring Kong to fight Godzilla in the middle of an OCEAN, then keep him chained when the actual threat appears? 

The deaf little girl was the only interesting character. It seems IMPOSSIBLE to me that you have Kong in a research center ALL THIS TIME and no one checked to see if he could pick up Sign Language, ESPECIALLY when you have a fluent Sign Language expert on staff. BULLSHIT.

Anyway, if you enjoyed it, I think it's wonderful you got it for free 😉.",2021-04-04 16:53:50

fh82n9,RIP Tom Hanks 😢,2020-03-12 18:05:20
fh82n9,"Everyone going nuts over Tom Hanks calling him a ""national treasure"" and saying he needs to be protected at all costs isn't aware that he is just another one of Hollywood's child predators and abusers, just like Spacey. 

Many also don't know that Hanks basically had a hand in Isaac Kappy's death either 🤷‍♀️",2020-03-12 04:57:57
fh82n9,"i've never heard of any accusations against hanks.  please link some sources.

fh82n9,"Well with Cosby it was way more than one person.  This is just one person and obviously a nut job from her twitter feed. Also a Trump supporter and Q bullshit follower.


That’s all sorts of cray cray wrapped into one person.  Yeah I’m not believing it 🤷🏻‍♂️",2020-03-12 12:58:30
fh82n9,"Does he actually? I was just on Hollywood Boulevard on Sunday for the first time ever (I’m from western Canada). I considered stopping in that store because it wasn’t far away and I had no idea what it was. 
That would have been cool to see Pauly Shore 🤷‍♂️",2020-03-12 04:58:02
fh82n9,"No, Trump would blame democrats. 😂",2020-03-12 01:55:41
fh82n9,"What kind of stupid logic is that? Just because he’s a millionaire, we shouldn’t care about his health and mortality. You do know that he wasn’t always a millionaire. Also, he has brought me joy since I was a child and he has never done anything remotely controversial is his life to dent that image either, so of course I want to be happy for him and his family. And people are actually upvoting your dumbass statement?? 🤦‍♂️",2020-03-12 15:56:30

86bb0w,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Deadpool. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Wade’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Deadpool truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Wade’s existential catchphrase “Fuck” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Marvel’s genius wit unfolds itself on their silver screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Deadpool tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2018-03-22 17:14:56

j993qo,"I watched What’s Eating Gilbert Grape last weekend with my parents and had nostalgia injected into my veins. I didn’t expect it at all. 

 My parents hadn’t seen it and it was years ago that I sorta watched it while drinking beer with my friends.

But the town, the little stores, the “WalMart” moving into their town, the clothes the realistic dialog and relationships happening in 1993 (same year Hocus Pocus came out), the relatable characters Etc. It brought me straight back to me being 12 years old during a much simpler time. 

I had tears running down my eyes numerous times during the film and after Arnie finally realized his mom “is never waking up” I went to the other room and balled my eyes out.  ☹️🙁😢",2020-10-12 06:02:28

azonzz,"I see movies alone on a Tuesday about once a month, $10 and take my own snacks and bottle of water. My husband thinks I’m so lame, it’s one of two things I do for myself without the kids. 

I take the kids to one movie each holidays, and put aside $50 and take our own snacks and buy an ice cream each. I know, calm down with the treats! 

This is the only way we can afford to go to the movies, husband would rather pirate movies and watch them at home (with subtitles 😂) and have a few beers. 

I won a movie experience when we lived in Melbourne from my work, two gold class tickets ($45 each), 8 items from the menu ($150) and two drinks each ($40) they bought food and drinks to us during the movie, and provided blankets and pillows for our lazy boys. It. Was. Heaven. Never in my wildest dreams would I ever ever pay for that. That’s an extreme high roller movie experience haha. ",2019-03-11 08:54:25
azonzz,"I had the same issue in my local Canadian theater. Bunch of kids enjoying a nice night at the theater with all of their buddies booking a whole row. Then, they chat all movie, phone on, beeping from WhatsApp or whatever, seat bumping, laughing at god knows what...

It was infuriating. So now, I go to the VIP experience. Ends up costing me $45 CAD for my tickets without popcorn. The VIP experience is adult only since they serve alcohol. Much better experience now.

The issue is, with the price? Add the theater, restaurant, babysitter? Very expensive. I see more movie at home now than at the cinema. We keep the cinema for date night and watch most movies during the weekend when the kids are asleep.

🤷‍♂️",2019-03-11 11:13:47
azonzz,"That’s the reason to buy Milk Duds or Peanut M&Ms: to chuck them at the idiots who are checking their phones. Works well! Funniest one was when I lobbed (gently) a half-full water bottle at some particularly obnoxious teens. They decided to open it and throw it randomly into the audience in front of us. They almost got their asses beaten by the crowd, little shits. 🤣

Also, get real: your television is not going to accurately reproduce the colors or yield the same immersive experience that a theater can. I have the best plasma screen Panasonic ever made (80% off a decade ago when the Industry wanted to sell us all 3D tvs) and a good 5.1 sound system I’ve assembled over thE years. It’s great, but not as good as a small theater or even close to IMAX.  I can’t afford to buy an Atmos sound system or whatever comes out next. TV is just easier and economical for a lazy, penny-pinching college parent.

Should I post on AITA?",2019-03-11 12:45:58
azonzz,"Ya know, go to the movies drag along 2 kids with snacks you're looking at $100+ on full price nights.

For about $2000-$2500 you can get an amazing 200""+ projector on Amazon with a screen. 

Most movies are out on blueray like 3 months after they are released in theatres and I can definitely wait for them.

If you are a family you can pretty much get the basics of your own home theatre for about 3k (projector + decent surround sound) or the cost of going to the movies 30 times.

I may not have a 200"" projector, I have a $160 720p one with a 100"" screen and I have absolutely no desire to go to the theatre anymore, I have a chromecast and a android box permanently attached and it's great as long as you understand that it will only work good in a dark environment like let's say watching movies 👀🎥🍫

My favorite part is that it is super portable, at camp in the summer I'll host movie night, we get together with friends, everyone's kids watch movies then once the people with kids are gone we'll put something on for us and drink a bit more heavily.

Only time I do go to the theatre is for tradition, my 3 siblings and I go and see every star wars movie together. ",2019-03-11 14:00:08
azonzz,Just one question - what headphones you use? 🤔,2019-03-11 14:08:21
azonzz,"My only 2cents on the matter are short and simple. It doesn't really matter if it's 35mm or IMAX'S laser projection the sheer size of even the smaller theater screens amplifies the experience way better than any TV/monitor out there. And that's all I've ever needed, as long as the audio works normally lol (hell there are movies like Bladerunner 2049, in IMAX, that I could watch without sound🤷‍♂️). 

P. S. 3D is AMAZING if used properly like in Peter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old.",2019-03-11 06:51:13

This might be unpopular but also the ""trivia"" and speeches given were so ""diverse and social justice"" focused that it felt like they went overboard on trying to correct the criticism from past years. As a non-US citizen it was exhausting.

But I personally wouldn't say Zombieland hardly did for Zombies what, say, Jurassic Park did for Dinosaurs.

All that said, [google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=zombies) shows that the upward trend started in May 2009, a month before the first trailer for Zombieland came out (but also when swine flu was going around🤔) so what the hell do I know",2020-05-19 19:31:22

k11owk,"I’m actually pretty disappointed in Mads Mikkelsen here. I understand the need to act and make a living. However, Depp has been one of the best things about the fantastic beast movies so far and really other then jack sparrow his biggest role. So for anyone to replace him is annoying. I think a lot of male actors need to look at the Depp/Heard situation and realize what is happening to Depp could easily happen to them. The situation runs deeper then just movies though, Depp is just another man who gets called abuser when in reality he is the victim. I will not see Fantastic Beast due to this decision. I will not see Aquaman 2 or any movie staring A**er *ear*. However I will pay to see anything staring Johnny Depp at least half a dozen times and will literally pay studios out of pocket for casting him. Depp deserves a career, she doesn’t. Depp deserves sympathy, she doesn’t. Depp is the victim, she isn’t. Btw I actually don’t even think Depp is that good of an actor, I just think he’s in the right 🤡🖕🏼",2020-11-27 00:41:36

My question is, why do you have a problem with people celebrating a landmark in Oscars history? If her being a woman with a vagina didn’t win her the award, why are you so offended by her gender or her genitalia?

Was a fan of shyamalan too but the whole race change thing was just odd. If you were going to go with a minority instead of white washing the show why not go with the minority that the show was about to begin with.

7xnroa,"Of *course* you're being downvoted.

Ask a woman if she's a feminist, and many will say no. Give the same women a list of stated goals of feminism and ask how they feel about it, and nearly all of them will agree with it.

The problem is people who didn't want women to have bodily autonomy or opinions or careers worked (and continue to work) very very hard to make feminism a Dirty Word™ with an endless parade of negative connotations in the hopes that people would oppose it without ever bothering to understand it. And they've mostly succeeded, clearly. Every feminist in the room could agree on what feminism is and explain how its efforts make society a better place for *everyone* and 90% of these people will just ignore it completely in favor of regurgitating some alt-right rhetoric (which they *totally* don't support despite constantly quoting their ideals verbatim).

Rabble rouser: WHY DO FEMINISTS HATE MEN? WHY DON'T FEMINISTS CARE ABOUT THE DISCRIMINATION MEN FACE? IF YOU DIDN'T HATE MEN YOU'D BE EGALITARIAN AND THEY'D JOIN YOU!

Feminist: Well see feminism aims to dismantle the societal biases that both sexes are subjected to, working to eliminate toxic masculinity is an egalitarian effort that addresses all of women's concerns *and* men's concerns. Everything you're complaining about is what we're complaining about. We're literally already on the same side here.

Rabble rouser: SEE GUYS SHE SAID ""TOXIC MASCULINITY"" FEMINISTS **HATE MEN** AND CREATE SEXUAL TERRORISTS BY REFUSING TO SLEEP WITH DYSFUNCTIONAL SOCIOPATHS WHO FEEL ENTITLED TO THEIR BODIES.

axs6xs,"This is going to be a bit long, so bear with me. I am in my 50s now, and for very many years I was a regular patron of Blockbuster.  I was not much of a patron of Toys R Us, but nonetheless grew up with them.  When Toys R Us closed their doors it hit me really hard. They were the place to go for kids stuff most of my life, and I was devastated when they went out of business.  They were everything that was right about business, giving people what they wanted for a good price.  Jeffery giraffe 🦒 had always been a symbol of joy and fun. 

Now through all of my young adult years I was a movie buff, and a trip to Blockbuster was generally a weekly occurrence.  At first it was great; drop in, check the new releases rack, pick up some popcorn and a soda, and enjoy a movie night.  I loved it. But then they decided that it was too expensive to carry enough copies of the latest releases, so most of the time the movie you wanted wasn't in stock. And then they decided that putting only new releases on that rack only highlighted that flaw, so they threw any movie  released in the past year on there.  And then they got rid of the rack altogether. And then they still weren't making enough profits, so they started charging exorbitant late fees and rewind fees.  It got so bad I stopped going and just bought the movies I wanted to see instead.  

So while some will get nostalgic about them, I say good riddance to a shitty business.  They got exactly what they deserved. ",2019-03-06 07:03:18

Also, these type of people cry and say shit like ""These movies are RAPING my childhood 😢😢😢"" as if the remake barges into their parents' house and stomps on the VHS they grew up with and erases the memories they had of it.

Everyone always makes fun of Keanu's acting in it, but they make fun of Keanu acting periodt. It's just how he is, laid-back surfer dude. Hailing from California myself, I love his acting. I love his voice and his mannerisms. I love how Rachel Weis played the non-dead twin alongside him. She brought credit to his acting just by being there. Then, seeing Gavin Rossdale play the villain - ug! Me and Gwen Stefani both swooned over that one, no doubt. And finally, the pièce de résistance, Tilda Swinton as the angel Gabriel, the real villain. Brilliant movie. Poor Shia Lebouf dies, but with his sexual allegations, maybe it's better he didn't make it through the first one. His character was cute as a button, though. ♥",2022-09-17 17:35:33

jxosr6,"Yeah, and I do think you're right about that, but that's why this movie wasn't made for me or your mom. And that was kinda disappointing for me, at least, cause a lot of my friends told me I would love it because it's a subtle commentary on all the things you've mentioned with a Latina protagonist. And then it wasn't, and I had that uncomfortable feeling that I was in a theatre watching a movie that wasn't made with people like me in mind surrounded by the people that it *was* made for.

I think there's a place for this movie, and I think it's important for those centrist white people to use it as a jumping off point to examine their own prejudices. I guess I'm just a little annoyed that this is another example of white people thinking something is new just because they've never seen it before.

There's also another user in my inbox right now fervently insisting that this wasn't a movie about racism, but I think perhaps your mom would agree with me when I say that it absolutely is. I hope she didn't have to watch it, though. 😂",2020-11-20 20:14:42

I'm glad you've found something you love and can make money to provide for yourself from I truly do appreciate the editors of anything and the times when I appreciate them most is when I've watched a film, music video, tv show or even an advert and not realised that it has been  edited, those are the times when I think 'wow the editing in this is amazing' it just flows and so yeah I may be a layperson to your craft but your apparent abscense of presence is probably what I'd consider as the tell tale sign of an amazing editor and even though I like to immerse myself in the media I'm consuming once it's done I do give things a proper a think and I'm grateful for the talents of an editor and other production staff for being so good they seem to not exist.

Edit because paywall:

>I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

>“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

>“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

>“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

>The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

>“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

>“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

>He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

>“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

>I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

>“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” 

>They didn’t.

>“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” 

>No one spoke up.

>“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

>It didn’t seem like they did.

>“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. 

>Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

>Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

>I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

>“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

>Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

>“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

>I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

>He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

>“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

>“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

>“Because I was afraid.”

>“Afraid?”

>“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

>I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

>“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

>He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.",2020-05-13 19:28:48

Or maybe Kojima is the Nolan of video games 🤔",2019-12-20 01:41:05
ecvyfu,"Here is my take - The theme is quite simple. Espionage / Doomsday film. They somehow figure out a way to travel bit ahead in time.. maybe few seconds (10-tenet!) and come back in reverse, literally.. against arrow of time; trying to catch / anticipate the exact moment of threat and stop it. Things happen in real time and with arrow of time but from protagonist perspective it happens in reverse.. car accident, bullets on windows, ship in reverse scenes. Nolan will definitely mix it up and show frames from either perspectives and viewers need to figure out who’s perspective they are watching at any given moment. Hence the palindrome name too.. TENET! 😉
It’s a beautiful take on arrow of time linked with second law of thermodynamics. So the visuals and VFX will be mind blowing and confusing and hence the high budget production. Memento skipped to frames in reverse chronology and then showed them forward but tenet will show the frames in reverse literally intermingled with natural flow.

ga4cve,"I think the weird thing about that scene is that the previous three movies had conditioned us to a degree with ""The bad guys get killed by dinosaurs, the good guys all live (or die saving others).""

Nedry, the Lawyer, most of the inGen mercs, Dieter, Ludlow and Kerby's mercs all die throughout the trilogy, and are the more ""bad"" end of the spectrum.  Only Muldoon, Arnold, Eddie Carr, and Masrani die as good guys, all doing something more or less heroic.  Everyone gets what they deserve, unless doing something to save others.

I think Zara (the assistant) was *supposed* to be seen as deserving it, because she was shown not being as attentive.  But for one, the kids intentionally tried to lose her, and for two, they were ""safe"" in the park regardless.  She didn't actively endanger them.  If it was Dr. Wu in that scene, or the military guy, no one would really care.  She didn't ""deserve"" it.

And one could argue dinosaurs don't distinguish between good and evil, but that narrative choice was lost  long ago.  The first three movies made dinosaurs into bringers of karmic justice, and World made no effort to change that tone going in.

Long rant to just say ""I agree,"" I guess. 😆",2020-04-29 13:18:06

vtnmyu,RIP to Eraser legend James Caan 🥺,2022-07-07 17:46:12
vtnmyu,"When we were living on Stone Canyon Rd near the Bel Air East Gate, my parents had these friends, Mike and Priscilla.
Their next door neighbor was James Caan.
Apparently he had an epic koi pond filled with some very rare, huge, expensive koi.
As the story goes, someone had been coming onto his property and stealing some of his fish.
His response to this was to get his rifle, camouflage himself somewhere near the pond and wait for the intruder.
Supposedly he held vigil for several nights before finally catching and scaring the living shit out of dude and The Bel Air Patrol were called.
But I don’t think he even pressed charges, he just wanted dude to leave his beloved koi alone.
I always thought this was so OG.
To sit somewhere Hidden, night after night waiting for this dude and then finally surprise motherfucker, I’m James Caan and I’ll shoot you if you make a move on my fish!
To me this was so friggin legendary.
I was like 15 at the time and it was the coolest thing I’d ever heard.
Rest In Peace Mr Caan.
I hope that there are many beautiful koi and ginormous ponds for them up there.
A true legend…
Thank you years of the best movies ever made.
You will be deeply missed ♥️",2022-07-08 00:32:24

I was perfectly content with paying so they could still have access to it, I would watch some of their kids content (3 year old and 1 year old twins) every now and then. It wasn't breaking the bank and it was convenient at times. But overall it wasn't nearly enough to deal with this trash system they want to implement. You know how many of them are going to sign up for accounts now? Yeah, not a single one.

It's crazy how out of touch these execs can be, thinking that they're going to start getting all these new subscriptions. They need 3 people to sign up to make up for my loss, that I probably would've just continued to pay, because it was convenient to just have access to something random when I couldn't find anything else to watch. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I was keeping them afloat or they're going to be sad that I left, but how many people were in my shoes? How many of these cancelations are going to happen that they wouldn't have cancelled otherwise?

iji9bg,"This is like the third time I’ve commented throwing it out there, but man I feel really strongly about it:

I’ve seen people comment online saying Letitia is pretty young and maybe too skinny (🙄) and such. 

Make that part of the story.

The beginning of it could even honor the real life cirumstances and have her acknowledge that. Perhaps T’Challa succumbed to such an illness (or have it actually be cancer) that - with all of Wakanda’s technological might and Shuri’s smarts - they were unable to save him and she feels a level of guilt of that. So many in infinity war and the MCU saw how smart Shuri was. Have her feel like she failed at being able to save him; which in turn makes her lose confidence with everything else.

She’s not ready to become Queen and certainly not Black Panther.

Her story arc as such could be by the end of the movie, she becomes a true leader, a Queen, and a hero as the new Black Panther.

avfecc,"Yeah. I definitely agree with you that transphobia is just becoming slightly less outwardly accepted. But society at large still thinks of trans women as perverted snowflakes. 

Instead of just having what I consider a medical condition from birth, in most cases. I wish more people knew about gender disphoria and the deep problems it causes.

I am a transgender woman. I didn't really believe it was a medical condition  before. I thought it was more a social and psychological ailment. 

But I proved myself wrong right when I started estrogen and horomones. 

I immediately felt a cloud lift from my brain. The world felt bright and I somehow felt normal for the first time in my life. 

I have always been depressed and anxious. I became a heroin addict for years to self medicate. 

I am clean now and my depression and anxiety is almost all gone. 

My horomones were messed up before I started horomone replacement therapy. I already had women's levels of testosterone and my other horomones were extremely low.
Starting horomone replacement therapy saved my life.

If more people knew about these kind of experiences, maybe they could understand that were just normal people trying to correct something that went wrong with our development in the womb.

Media that shows trans women as large non-passing, almost drag queen looking people, usually. 

The bathroom protections and token bills like that, are good of course. But what we actually need is health care and education for cis people and future trans people.

I shouldn't have to have the sinking feeling that, I will never be able to afford  the surgeries that would help me live a normal life. Facial feminization surgery is about 30 thousand dollars. Same for genital reconstruction surgery. I wish these surgeries were covered by insurance, and seen as just correcting an medical condition. 
Not a vanity surgery. Like cis women getting breast enlargement or lipo suction. (Not shaming those surgeries though)

Sorry to rant haha. I appreciate you being a good cis gendered ally! Your right, we need more cis gendered allies that speak up for our rights. So thanks! ☺

Olivia was beyond instrumental in helping to raise funds for the hospital to be built. Each year, she continued to play a major role in raising money for the hospital, in particular the annual walk which she regularly attended. She always had such a bright and vivacious spirit, and happily interacted with the staff and other participants.  Olivia was an exceptional Australian role model. 🌹",2022-08-09 08:53:49

No, I don’t want to hear what kind of ignorance and magical thinking has led you to believe that Clinton is worse than a President who can barely function. Life is too short.

You’re absolutely correct that they utterly fail to grasp what it was that made those stories great.

7kehsc,"Twilight came out almost *ten years ago* 🙄 It was the first project he had to do when moving to Hollywood. Actors can grow and choose better things to do once they learn how to fight their agents and control their own careers. He’s been doing only art house films since 2012 and all his performances have been very good because he was finally allowed to do what he wanted. Twilight was just for money and publicity, but he never wanted to do commercial stuff. If he truly sucked, he would’ve disappeared like poor Taylor Lautner. Or he’d be doing irrelevant bombs and after irrelevant bombs like Zac Efron. The difference is clear. Just because he did Twilight at 21, doesn’t mean he’s the same actor at 32. He’s one of the best actors of his generation right now and he’s doing some of the best work out there. While many of his contemporaries are already struggling to keep their careers alive, he’s just starting to create real buzz around him. Twilight couldn’t be more irrelevant at this point. ",2017-12-17 20:51:42
7kehsc,"That’s true. I found her the most frustrating of all. Audiences were supposed to connect to the story through her and she was so flat. All that lip biting, excessive blinking, eye rolling, ironic exhaling. I felt like everyone was trying to be their characters but she was so disconnected the whole time - 5 freaking years 🤦🏻‍♀️. I felt like I was watching a school play starring the reluctant understudy. Idk if she was over the whole project, but damn, at least for the paycheck try a little harder. She tried a little harder in New Moon but then went back to the same stuff the following sequels. I enjoyed her so much in other movies but here she was only interesting as a vampire. I think people blame Rob too much but she was the problem. Meanwhile, Taylor was very much into the whole thing and did everything to not be fired yet his career stalled right after. I feel bad for the kid. He really fought for that part. ",2017-12-17 22:30:28

So I'll assume you guys have the absolute bare bones in equipment and work from there. Since these are voice recordings from the 60s\70s there won't be much fidelity to capture so you should be pretty safe. 

I've only done this with a Windows machine but I think there are similar settings on Mac. If not this will at least give you an idea of what to Google.  

You'll need to get the audio from the tape deck to the computer. Technically you should use a line input. If you have a desktop computer it might be the blue connector. If you have a laptop you can use one of [these things](https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-UCA222-BEHRINGER-U-CONTROL/dp/B0023BYDHK) or something similar. If you're a cheapskate like my Dad you can just use the microphone input (if you have a headphone/microphone combo jack you'll [need this doo-dad](https://www.amazon.com/Kingtop-Adapter-Tablet-Headsets-Version/dp/B01I3A47I4)). 

Note that the Mic input is ""hot"" in the sense that it's very sensitive to the noise coming into it and a line level input from a tape deck with clip out all the audio. You'll need to dial the mic sensitivity down. In Windows 10 right click the audio icon>Sounds>Recording>Select your default mic input>Properties>Listen>✔Listen to this device (to monitor)>Levels>Adjust levels. How to adjust levels should be apparent soon.

If you're using a Walkman type player you can connect with a simple auxillary cable (double sided male headphone jack). If you have a big tape deck just hook it into the Mic or Line jack with [one of these](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-3-5mm-2-Male-Adapter-Cable/dp/B01D5H8KO2). Toss a tape in there and let it play. Check to see if you can hear it with the ""Listen to this device"" checked. Adjust the levels to where it sounds normalish. You'll fine tune it next. 

Install [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). In the top bar you'll see a mic input drop down, select your line in or mic input. Click the audio meter for the mic next to check your input levels. Advice on this varies but in general keep the green bar bouncing on the low end between the -12 and -6 during normal audio levels on the tape. This gives some wiggle room when people on the tape get antsy. You can adjust that with the OS input levels and fine tune it with the Audacity mic levels. 

Restart your tape, hit record, and play it through. 

When exporting I like to use FLAC for lossless audio but if you're looking for something more practical just use a high quality setting for [MP3](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#lame). FLAC is built in but you'll have to install the MP3 exporter (which I just linked wiki instructions for). You can also use WAV but its a lot bigger and doesn't support tags. When you export you'll have options to tag the artist data. I like to input as much data as I have about the tape in these fields. It will display in any compatible media player and it keeps things generally more organized.

If you don't want to bother with any of that you could try visiting local music shops and recording studios and I'm sure there's someone there that you could pay to have it done. I've never tried that though. 

Hope that sets you down the right path. Preserving old audio like that of our parents is important. I have a box of old ""love tapes"" my Dad mailed to my Mom when they were dating. I should digitize them... but it's really weird to hear. Maybe I'll send them out.  ",2019-02-10 08:33:45

He has one question mark on him but it almost feels like “hey we gotta put at least one on him so let’s slap this here.” I don’t design costumes or characters for movies so IDK what I would’ve done but this just doesn’t feel like the Riddler. I know they’re trying to do something new but IDK. 

They could have went in a dark direction & still kept something that reminded you of the character. Notice how Batman is wearing a cowl that has pointy ears & a pointy nose? He looks like Batman…Notice how Penguin reminds you of previous versions of Penguin? Catwoman doesn’t have the mask on but she has a black suit on & you could at least say “oh okay well she’s just Selina Kyle here” and isn’t wearing a Catwoman mask yet.

Don't get me wrong, I'm excited. But this didn't look or feel like Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul.

Despite any quality grievances of these pieces, they still have a similar style when you look at the shots and even the color palettes. There's a *consistency*, even though visually the series only improved as it went. 

Here though, it didn't seem to have that. **TL;DR:** What it did feel like, imo, was a Netflix style show with *Breaking Bad drapes.*",2019-08-25 03:25:39

Humans naturally confer traits based on appearance and we are further conditioned by our society to make even more associations.  Point being: all humans act.  It’s just pretending to be something different than yourself which is what most people do day in and day out.  We need to stop glorifying actors to the degree we do.

hy9122,"What an incredible woman.... Not just an actress, but an activist as well. Her performances will certainly never be forgotten; I mean, who else could have been Maid Marion so perfectly!?!? But also her spirit. She was no frail maiden as so many of her parts would suggest. Her will was strong, and her mind keen.

Her fight against the studio system and it's suffocating contracts resulted in the ""De Havilland Law"" and the ""seven year rule""...

From Wikipedia:
The decision was one of the most significant and far-reaching legal rulings in Hollywood, reducing the power of the studios and extending greater creative freedom to performers. California's resulting ""seven-year rule"", as articulated by the Court of Appeal in analyzing Labor Code Section 2855 in the De Havilland case, is still known today as the De Havilland Law.

❤️❤️❤️May this dear, brave woman rest in peace. Thank you, madam, for all you were and did. ❤️❤️❤️

hy9122,"So sad.  I wish everyone would stop describing her as the actress in Gone With the Wind.  She was in many great films, besides that controversial thing.  For me, she will always be the ultimate Maid Marion in Adventures of Robin Hood, and also as the Governor’s beautiful daughter in Captain Blood.

Norman Lloyd is still kicking at 105.

Vaudeville in the 20s. Broadway in the 30s, Hitchcock films in the 40s, produced TV in the 50s/60s, starred in St. Elsewhere and ""Dead Poets Society"" during the 80s, a sci-fi show in the 90s (""Seven Days"" on UPN), and the rom-com, ""Trainwreck"" as recently as 2015.

He's the oldest Hollywood actor ""working"" today. 😮",2020-07-27 04:14:25

hy9122,"My dad passed suddenly at 64. Likely of a heart attack. I wanted to get screened for preventative cardiovascular issues as did my brother... what my doc said next really put things in sobering perspective. 

“I know 64 seems young- and you have my full condolences, but understand that for an American male born in 1954, the average lifespan was 66 years then- so he’s precisely in the ballpark, and insurance would not classify your dad as having had an *early* death, that’s actually reserved for men under 55. We obviously know and hear a lot about people who live to 80- but that’s in fact a minority of people. Your heart’s fine, stay active and eat well.”

Sucks, but because 75-80 is typical, there’s also a whole lot of 62/67/71 in there that’s typical 😔",2020-07-26 19:52:01

Angela Lansbury was in one of my favorite films ever ... Gaslight. She was SO YOUNG!!

She’s been upgrading appliances/furniture/etc in her house like nobody’s business and still (at least pre-COVID) has better shopping endurance than I do.

My bachelor uncle lives with her, but she has always insisted on driving herself to the store, hairdresser, etc. She also picks up her friends to bring them to bridge club because she’s the only one who can still drive 🤦🏻‍♀️ She has angels, man.",2020-07-26 19:30:46

So I went to RT website and read the reviews and it was like 400 something white guys and less than 20 women reviewing a movie probably made for woman.  Some of the guys comments had nothing to do with the movie.  Stuff like the directors last film was crap, and comment about production.

When you finish the Gymnasium,you have the highest graduation that you can earn in Germany ( it took you 12 years and you are qualified to go to Universities). I was only on the Hauptschule (9 years and no good job perspectives but I'm fine 😊) so I can not really tell you something about that because in Hauptschule we don't do intellectual stuff ,the government think that we're too dumb for stuff like that .

T&H see wild white dragon, get excited (both) 

Oh shit she's actually a bad girl and toothless is not mature enough for her or something (also maybe evil)

H: Don't hang around the bad kids bro

T: fakka u DAD stop smothering me *hairflip*

Best friend break up scene 💯 sad, maybe montage of sad Hiccup with unsure toothless. 

Toothless realizes he ain't with it. Goes to Hiccup who has ""moved on""

T: ?????

H: fakka u 

T: 💯 sad 

Astrid (edited to the right girl) who will lacks significant screen time this movie: ay don't be dumb he's your bro 

T&H: Huff puff ""boys"" make up mode. 

Villain literally doesn't matter since the main point is Toothless getting the girl anyway. 

Hufflepuff sends his Ravenclaw to be with Gryffindor, movie ends with Hiccup and Toothless kids playing together in some bittersweet way. 

E: Forgot to mention the two 10 minute flight scenes, one which will be the opening with Hiccup trying out some new gadget (and it probably failing), and the other which will show Moonfury being able to fly just as fancy as the bro team which is what will make our night boy fall for her in the first place.

7nv683,"To be fair, you have to have a very high appreciation for worldbuilding to understand Bright. The metaphors are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of urban fantasy in the context of American noir most of the worldbuilding will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Jakoby's orcish outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Shadow of War, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this world, to realise that it's not just immersive it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bright truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Ward's existential catchphrase “We gonna titty bar gunfight die” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as David Ayer's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂

I loved Rogue one and liked TLJ, but I’ve been watching the original trilogy on rerun for decades before these came out and, they don’t seem to add anything new. At least with the prequels cgi overkill, Lucas attempted to innovate the palette, ship design, action, etc. Even though the attempts didn’t land, I was given scenes greater than the overall movies.

I can’t tell you a scene in any of the the new films (that I do like🤔) that stand out above anything I’ve seen in Star Wars. Even all the characters dying in Rogue and Red Room battle in TLJ don’t match up to Darth Maul vs Ginn and Ben/Yoda vs Dooku/ anything in the originals.

This is Star Wars and we haven’t even recieved an innovative and layered action set piece beyond what we’ve already seen: Space battle, ground battle, Saber battle. 

They can mix it up, genre mash it up, a war can be fought in covert ops, in sleeper agents(probably finn and poe already as Knights of Ren), secret agent, the james bond of the universe, exploration, politics, real jedi(not the skywalkers) training, Sith mystique, A sith jedi training day type movie,more facets to the wars not explored, why are we covering the same old beats.

p6xosu,That's awesome. Can we revamp the suit tho 🙄,2021-08-18 23:06:28
p6xosu,I’ve always had a super unpopular opinion bc I never found Falcon that entertaining or interesting and he always seemed very much like a ‘side character’ to me that I didn’t care much about (even in the Disney+ show I cared more about Bucky more than Falcon - forgot his name - his sister and that damn boat 😅) but nonetheless I’m looking forward to seeing him helm his own feature film and hoping to be proven wrong and converted into more of a fan.,2021-08-19 00:58:30
p6xosu,"Can't say I'm surprised, but also very likely not seeing whatever that is. Captain Falcon is just too lame for me. I think Mackie is a good actor and I like his personality, but not in this role. His Marvel character is okay in small doses, but as a leader and main dude, I was never won over in the show.   

But you know, if they have a totally unique feel to what a Captain America movie is and break the traditional mold of Cap, purposely and intelligently, it *could* work 🤷‍♂️",2021-08-18 23:48:05

p6xosu,"I think outside of Bucky and Zemo, Sam’s storyline with Isaiah Bradley and learning to become captain America was a really solid storyline. I think it just might not have connected with people because it was bogged down with the flag smashers storyline, Sharon’s story, and the strength of Bucky and his story. 

I really liked the fact that he tried several times to use his counsel training to talk his way out of issues too. While Steve always kind of went in with a physical plan of attack, Sam would try to talk it out since he knew he couldn’t handle super soldiers. It just seemed like he knows his limits and he’s going to try and work within them. 

I’m fully expecting him to end up getting the serum though eventually 😂",2021-08-18 20:48:28

The actual issue is _making it happen_.  Strength, accuracy, and precision.  There's no chance he can throw a 12-lb projectile 100 feet to a 1/16"" tolerance, or whatever.  Even Olympic athletes aren't doing that.",2021-08-18 22:44:07

There was a lot of things in this movie where people could relate to . Specially if your an immigrant. If you don’t get the movie count your blessing that you have a healthy family dynamic or your not an immigrant in America and have to endure constant micro aggressions from this society ❤️

As a lifelong DC fan, their film and tv projects in recent years have been largely mediocre-to-disappointing. I actually didn't hate BvS, MoS, and WW was actually really good. For me, it's heartbreaking to see them take such great material and execute adaptations so poorly.

I'd hate to just throw it all out and totally restart the DC film/tv universe bc there are certainly things I do like. But given the choice of either salvaging it as it is or restarting and doing it right....🤷‍♂️",2018-09-16 21:37:53

I’m hoping he had a good life; I know 79 years of age is a decent life span; but oh no!

Because I read one of those false “Abe Vigoda died “ headlines years ago on the Internet, only it was for Fred Ward. 

I really enjoyed his style of acting and the way he made a story come alive with the addition of his character, without an apparent need to steal the scene. He did really well in ensemble casts and  he could hold attention as the star, just as well. 

The entertainment industry has a real need to tell us who our stars are, but we know that on our own.

z096f7,"This is incredibly sad. My first cosplay was the Green Ranger. 

I made the helmet from scratch. Time well spent when it's your own crafted item from scratch.

Shortly after, I made the pink ranger helmet for my wife.

We heard there was a ""make a wish"" event that was super hero themed in our area. We got the full power ranger outfits, put on the helmets and joined this event for a little 5 year old boy.

Tons of people took pictures with us. It was a very fun time. I can't imagine the thrill JDF got with all his star struck fans.

He really was the MVP of our childhood.

z096f7,"I changed my name to Tommy and tried to grow out my hair for one week when I was four because of this man. When Toys R’ Us didn’t have a license plate keychain with my name on it, I picked his and taped it to my bedroom door, while a large white air-kicking White Ranger decal on the wall adjacent to my bed hovered over me, protecting me as I slept. He got me to clean the living room daily before each episode so that I had the space to copy his fight moves; and, he gave me the courage in pre-school to ask my crush—one of two if we’re counting Kimberly—to go the Power Rangers live-action show with me, even though I’d eventually get scared by Zedd’s scenes ask my parents if we can leave early. RIP to the man who made Tommy come alive. Thank you for bringing so much joy to my childhood 🙏",2022-11-20 19:42:26

Glad for Ke Huy Quan, but like Cate Blanchett (who probably had the best speech of the night), was surprised Michelle Yeoh didn't take best actress. Also great to see Brendan Fraser and Better Call Saul take the wins. Overall, it was a good night, but felt like a few of my other favorite films (like Banshees of Inisherin) got shut out completely.

Weird: The Al Yankovic Story's wins felt completely buried, even though Weird Al was in attendance. He could have at least accepted for Daniel Radcliffe, but it seemed like they wanted to hurry it along as quick as possible. It still amazes me how they cut out tons of categories (and combined a few) but it still runs 3 hours long. Seth Rogen probably had the funniest bit, where he talked about how The CW is airing the ceremony while none of their shows had been nominated by critics. 😬",2023-01-16 06:30:16

The story and social commentary are very well done, it's lean and efficient so the story and tension stay hurtling forward on rails, the performances are great - especially Michael Caine - and it's *absolutely gorgeous.* Everyone likes to talk about the big pitched battle they did in one continous shot, but the scene that stuck with me years later was the carjacking.

If they don’t want the film to drag, they better be able to fill that runtime with something good. Infinity War didn’t FEEL like two and a half hours cause it had so many characters to play around with. Bond isn’t usually like that. Here’s to hoping it works out 🤞🏻",2020-02-26 23:23:01

n0ehbn,"From left to right:

1.	The gruff, tough, soft-at-heart father figure to the main character. 

2.	The cat, who will either be the wisest character that only the main character can speak with, or is a just a rehash of “sassy destructive cat that everyone gives a pass to”. If there are musical numbers, the cat will be a slapstick focal point in at least 2 shots.
3.	the quirky girl best friend that is never explicitly interested in the main character and whose main character trait is “weird”.
4.	the main character struggling with an identity crisis at 10
5.	the ocean’s local sea-jock; someone “on the other side” to “show the ropes” but also isn’t explicitly a good person until halfway or the end of the film
6.	three bullies that punk on main character until he learns to use his powers. 

There, now no one has to see it.

EDIT3 POST RELEASE: a couple replies suggesting I’m pretty close with my guesses, I still need to watch it myself and will report back with my final two cents. I’m just glad people can get double the entertainment 😄

——-

EDIT: added the cat in its proper order

EDIT2: from another response of mine:

It’s less cynicism and more sillyism. I’ll probably still watch the movie. Just setting my expectations ahead of time. Sometimes it works in my favor and I’m surprised by something in the movie, and those are usually the movies I like the most (ones I can’t roughly map the narrative trajectory of). This poster, while potentially transparent, is still well done in terms of the goal of mass appeal and easy to understand. All of the things I listed in my first comment could be positives and things to look forward to in a movie, to some. Just not me.",2021-04-28 14:05:43

p688bu,"Exactly! Working at/owning a convenience store is probably not going to make any of them happy every day all the time, but doing something not too hard, with the people you love, and making enough money to live is a highly underrated goal. This movie definitely made me feel better about quitting my career that was killing me in favor of gig work, which makes me far less money, but means t get drive around all day listening to the radio. Like the go-carts 😅 And I don't enjoy it all the time, especially when bills are due, but man, being happy and healthy is worth more than people think (again, with the caveat that you still need money to be healthy and happy. Money absolutely buys happiness up to a point. Being satisfied with making *enough* money is the hard part.)",2021-08-17 22:02:55

Good afternoon all.  - If anyone is interested in joining us, we are doing a live stream tonight.  This is for my Civil Air Patrol Squad, but feel free to join.  Here is the email I sent to them.  It has the links included.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

We are going to do something a little different tonight. 

50 years ago on Apollo 13 the famous words from Astronaut John Swigert were uttered.  ""Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here"".  These words are part of our culture.  A slightly altered version of it was included in the Apollo 13 movie.    


The plan for tonight is we will be starting later.  At 9pm.  I know that is too late for a lot of folks.  If you can join that will be great.  If not, you can watch it on your own time frame.  I'm going to start the movie at my home at exactly 9:17.  When the movie says that historic line, it will be exactly 50 years ago that it was said on the spacecraft.

So if you can, join our live stream, have your copy of Apollo 13 downloaded and ready to play and we can watch and discuss the movie as well as the Apollo missions while watching the movie.  For legal reasons, I cannot show the movie on the live stream.  You will have to have your own copy ready.  FYI - It's not on Netflix - I looked 🙂

Direct video link for 9:00pm tonight.

Yeah, like ""Wish You Were Here"", which was an ode to their friend Syd Barret which they had to kick from the band due his drug use combined with schizophrenia (the whole album's theme is both an ode to Syd and criticism against the music industry). Of course, the lyrics are vague enough that anyone could apply it the the people their loved ones they miss.

On that same album, ""Welcome to the Machine"" is about how the music industry dehumanize the artists into commercial products and destroy all their creative artistry. But many also interpret how it's a criticism against society™",2020-09-17 02:09:04

90ixfp,"I can understand where Disney is coming from, but nonetheless, as some of those tweets definitely were a bit crude for the likings of Disney, but I am quite depressed about this. Even if Taika was to take over, it wouldn’t be the same (though I do concede there is the chance that the movie would still be *amazing* under Taika, and I’d be willing to see that movie). James Gunn really knew these characters and is an amazing writer and director. You can tell everybody loves working with him and has amazing ideas. He really in particular seems to be super enthused and knowledgeable about the cosmic universe, the direction the MCU seems to be heading in. I would have loved to have seen a James Gunn directed Nova movie for example. It’s truly a real tragedy that Marvel Studios has lost the amazing talent that is James Gunn. It truly wouldn’t be what it is without him. Yes, this leaves the door open for new opportunities, both good and bad, but the GOTG was practically his creation. I think they should at least let him finish the movie, or at the true bare minimum use his script if he even gets to finish it. He said GOTG 3 would set the tone for the next 10-20 years of the MCU. That’s some serious business and I’d take his word on that. A true damn shame and sad day this has been for me to find this out, for MCU fans everywhere. It hit me like a truck when I woke up from a nap, opened Reddit, and saw this. 😔😞

PS. I feel like I should add I’m not literally clinically depressed over this. It’s definitely okay to be sad about this news though. I wonder if the other cast comes out and says stuff like “I won’t do this movie w/o James Gunn” or something of the sort, or Kevin Feige (hell even Stan Lee) can pull some magic strings, if they can negotiate some way for him to finish the trilogy. Maybe he could do the entire thing for free? Idk. I’m curious if he waltzed on over to DCEU execs if Disney would reconsider their offer, though after writing this I’m sure he signed some non-compete agreements. This really sucks.",2018-07-21 07:19:18

17ir4kp,"I'm 40 years old, peak F.R.I.E.N.D.S. loving age, and this is the first celebrity death which has devastated me.

I can't tell you how much I love that show. I know people say it's not funny or it's outdated or whatever, but I just love it. It's been a huge constant in my life for over 20 years. I don't have a group of friends and this show has always comforted me and made me wonder what it would have been like to have been lucky enough to have experienced friends like them.

I don't think I could begin to even try and guess how many times I've seen all 10 seasons from start to finish. 20? 30? It honestly could be more and I wouldn't be surprised. And that's not even including all the random epsidoes I've caught here and there. I can tell you which episode is on just from hearing the first scene. It's my comfort show. My background show. My nothing else is on show.

Over the past couple of days I've been thinking about doing a re-watch (the 3rd for this year) because my Dad did the 2 fist bumps together at my Mum, just like Ross did to Monica. My parents aren't even huge fans like me but they still incorporated a reference into their lives and had to tell me about it because they knew I would love it.

Rest in Peace, Ms Chanandler Bong. I could not BE any sadder. ☕️ 🚬",2023-10-29 02:18:19

The awkwardness, the desperation to be feeling loved, the never ending love towards Joey and others, the fear of commitment, so many things I could go on. Chandler won’t be Chandler without you.
Thank you for bringing life to the character called Chandler. Thank you for conveying through the character, that it’s okay to be awkward in love. Thank you for being so open about your struggles. Thank you for everything you have done, and for each and every smile you’ve put on someone’s face, who watch you.

9cdbn8,"This will probably get burried, but I'd encourage everyone who's seen the movie to read this review of it: https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/review-the-authoritarian-populism-of-incredibles-2 

While the movie itself was a fun romp, some of the underlying themes really didn't sit well with me. ""Make superheros legal again""? Sounds awfully familiar. 🤔 The whole time I was watching it I thought the movie was going to point out that relying on superheroes to solve society's crime problem is an unrealistic solution that has tremendous costs. 

Toward the beginning this message gets telegraphed in multiple ways (minor spoilers): the Parr family's response to the Underminer only increases the chaos and destruction there would have been without their intervention, which echoes other stories that explain why superheroes were banned from interviening like that; the Devor parents probably would have lived if they had reached out to law enforcement instead of a superhero, which is why Evelyn resents supers. The reason superheroes even need a PR campaign is because the public is pissed at them for fucking things up all the time while ""doing good"". 

While no decent person would agree with the tactics of the antagonist, the fears they were animated by were very well founded, with clear examples that both movies seem to back up. 

I had other issues with the movie, but I'll leave it at that for now. All in all I thought the message was kind of strange and it left a bad taste in my mouth.",2018-09-02 21:22:03

Edited like BR - Yes, Freddie loved Mary, no question about that at all - my problem with this love story was that during his love for Mary he was also very much having sex (and falling in love) with men. Which the film glossed over with winks at gas stations.

llwbpb,"Came here to say this. 

If you can do it with Justice League, fuck it, let's do it for every shitty movie we've got. 

[""Doing what I can with what I got.""](https://imgur.com/gallery/yQyFrn2)

While we're at it, can we change the ending of the 7th Tremors movie so *MAJOR FUCKING SPOILERS* >!Burt Gummer doesn't die or at least bring Jamie Kennedy back, or Marvel style recast Jon Heder, so he dies saving his son instead of a random-ass person who could have easily saved themselves. OR cut out the forced montage of Burt clips from the end so that way his death is at least ambiguous.!< Seriously beyond pissed about that one. >!THAT is no way for him to go.!<

I would also like to point out that the next Tremors *HAS* to be titled Tremors 8: Ouroboros and >!bring everyone back for Burt's funeral!< . Otherwise, what's the fucking point?

I have feelings about it, people. *FEELINGS!!!*

One of my favourite childhood memories is picking out Tremors 2 from the local gas station's movie rentals and  forcing my parents to watch it. I was probably 5-6 at the time. 

Let's say that it's been a lifelong love affair ever since. It took me another 10 years before I even watched the 1st. Probably why I hold [good sequels in such high regard.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lkv3gs/pirates_of_the_caribbean_at_worlds_end_has_one_of/) I didn't even know about the 1st until it played as a trailer in front of 2 and never thought to watch until years later. That's a testament to its filmmaking if I ever knew one.

So seriously, >!that's how they chose to kill off one of the most well known and prolific characters in a movie/TV series known around the globe? With an unnecessaryily needed death and a montage of clips from all the other movies that are obviously better than this one.!<

And I'm saying that as someone who defends [Chibnall/13th Doctor](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/jcqcup/chibnall_children_choice_and_consequence/) and I'm fucking fuming because THIS is how you *actually* destroy something people love and hold dear to their hearts. It's like the ending of Game of Thrones. >!His shitty ass death has made it a loooooot harder to rewatch.!< And they are one of my favourite series!!! Not flawless but fun. But I will defend every other movie and all the episodes except this. Honestly I'll still defend 7/8ths of this one as well. 

>!Like I said, it's easily fixed too. Fucking vice versa swap out Jon Heder for Jamie Kennedy, who the movies have been building up for the last two, and have Burt save his son in front of his old flame. Boom, you won't even need the montage of clips cause you can just have Travis and his mom reminisce about Burt instead. Show not tell. I don't even care he died by Graboid (although in all honesty, I've allways wanted El Blanco to take him down or Burt kills himself from the PTSD. It would have AT LEAST MADE SENSE. Hell, the best would be a heart attack to callback Val's ""Yeah, Burt, the way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get a chance to survive World War Three."". But none of us ever get the best death.). And it's not even about Burt sacrificing himself to save a nobody. Cause that could work too. BUT YOU NEED TO BUILD THAT SHIT UP. Not just fucking drop it like it's hot.!<

Like I said too, the first 7/8ths ain't bad but it's an entirely different story than a swansong for a hero. 

>!It's all about some billionaire scientist/cowboy hunter dude who likes to get his jollies off hunting the biggest and the baddest who ends up inviting people to this island so they can hunt down Super-Graboids he designed for shits and giggles. But then some Shrieker-fy....!<

And the pretentious douches come and die one by beautiful one while Burt tries to save them anyway and it's all spectacularly dumb fun until it comes crashing down in the final 10 minutes. Fuck, they should just cut the last 10 minutes. Then it's a perfect little Tremors ditty. 

#RELEASETHE7THTREMORSWITH10MINUTESFROMTHEENDCUT#

This isn't even about Jon Heder either. He's just doing his job. Hell, do what /u/VoiceofRonHoward pointed out. 

>""It is clear that Jon's character was just pasted in over Jamie's, the artifacts of the father-son relationship are all over it.  They should have gone full Marvel and just replaced Jamie with Jon and acted like nothing happened.""

CAUSE FUCK YES!! The only time a story sucks is when they don't commit. Commitment makes all the difference. Now, I'm pissed double-pissed they didn't do that instead since Heder and Kennedy are similar in terms of white-boy-ness.

One of my favourite bits of Tremors lore comes from the 5th too so it's not like I hate sequel changes out of hand:

>""This is a warrior dance. Our ancestors hunting the lnkanyamba and the Impundulu.

>""What's that?

>""Impundulu. It's what you call the Ass Blaster.

>""Ass Blaster.

>""Yes.

>""Yes.

>""Hey, you know, you make Ass Blaster sound good.

Primitive cultures fighting Graboids, Shriekers and Assblasters. I just love that thought. 

Hilariously, my meta opening to the 8th movie would be a flashback to 10,000 years ago and a Neanderthal-like Burt Gummer teaching others how to drive Graboids off cliffs like they did with mammoths.

Thank you for giving me the space to rant. Cause fuuuuuuhhhhhhhhuuccck!!!

Here's Michael Gross' own words from [his AMA](https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/jg62ap/hello_reddit_im_michael_gross_im_known_for/g9oia1i) that prove the people making Shrieker Island didn't know their shit. 

>My only question would be were there ever any studio decisions made for Burt that you refused to comply with? Or was everybody pretty much always on the same page on what to do with the character? 

>Thanks again for your dedication.

>- Josh""

>""Thanks for the kind words, Josh.  As regards the first four films, with Wilson and Maddock as the writers, we were very much on the same page.  5,6, and 7 were a bit different, because there was a 13-year hiatus between 4 and 5, and we had to refresh our memories while ""reinventing"" the franchise for a new audience.  I will give you one example:  in an early draft of Shrieker Island, a new writer wrote a draft where Burt threatened to shoot one of the bad dudes, and I had to tell him—this is true—""Burt never intentionally points his gun at another human being.""

And his own thoughts on >!Burt's ""death""!< and how to bring it all back together again.

>Universal and the director [came] to me with this idea, and they said, >!'This could be emotionally very powerful, if we have to say goodbye to this man after 30 years. And I hemmed and hawed, and I thought about it a little bit. And I said, 'You're absolutely right about the emotional gut punch this can be.' And I said, 'You're going to hurt a lot of people's feelings.' And I said, 'But I thought this franchise was over after four. So I could certainly live with it being over after seven.'!<

>""What we negotiated -- well, it wasn't really a negotiation, we all agreed on this -- is that we kind of left the door open. >!Because although Burt is gone, we never see a corpse. We never see his remains.!<

>""There are no guarantees, but for those who wonder aloud if this is the final film, I will say what I have said before: SALES drive sequels, Show biz is 5% show and 95% business, so if this latest addition to the Tremors franchise, sells well, [Universal] will follow the money, and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment may will be back for more.""


/u/ActorMichaelGross, the bell has been rung and the song sung. Get the producers on this ASAP!!

I was also the first person to discover [the symbolic foreshadowing of Stumpy's end with Earl's sleeping bag in the original movie.](https://reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/7aywuh/tremors_symbolically_foreshadows_its_ending_with/) Let's just say, I really *really* love these movies. So if anyone knows anyone, hook me up to the producers of this series and I'll Justin Lin in the Fast and Furious out of this series.

Since I don't think it's good to critique without proposing either, I say we can make up for this fuck up with the next movie. We'll call it Tremors 8: Ouroboros. After the snake which eats its own tail.

We find out >!Burt faked his death to get the Proudfoot Corporation to let down their guard and when everyone from the previous series comes back for Burt's fake funeral they give him ever loving shit for being such a paranoid whack-job that he would fake his death to fool a government agency. Why would he do this? He found an old photo of Hiram Gummer with a Graboid warning on the back and asks himself why this valley, why these things, why allways me? And we find out, it's not Burt. It's that lifestyles of extremes will end up in places of extremes. Burt and the Graboids are survivors of different species. Sure the Proudfoot Corporation IS using Mixmaster to combine Graboids, Shriekers, and Ass-Blasters into one super creature for the military but it pales in comparison to Burt looking at his life and wondering in shame how many ancient giants like himself he has killed. And with that, he actually dies, and we keep the ball rolling with the rest of the characters trying to stop what they allways thought was just another one of Burt's crazy conspiracies.!<

That's why it's Ouroboros. Everything comes back around. We could even end/start the movie with Grady and Earl opening a Monster World in Perfection Valley a la Desert Jack's Graboid Adventure which leads into a new TV show. I don't know. I'm fucking trying harder than the people they paid to do this already. 

It ain't perfect but I'm building on sand here so changes are gonna get made.

Like if the makers of Tremors [notice this,](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ex5szm/fast_furious_two_years_ago_i_called_hans/) then DM me because fucking A you guys need some help.

The Flash, LOL where to start.  The first season is pretty damn fun, with undertones of ""So bad it's good"" (but not in any way comparable to Legends), and it just devolves further with each season.

t23swj,"No offense taken, man. I was just expanding on your comment.🖖

But if you’re gonna look into it, there’s a lot going on in Soviet cinema beyond Tarkovsky, since it was a place with a large economy and a lot of extremely educated people but a relatively closed off access to the exterior world from the 1930s onwards, so it’s kinda like looking to an alternate reality where cinema language went on a different path.

Just take a look at War and Peace by Sergey Bondarchuk where the Soviet regime in 1960 poured an insane amount of money (what today would be around a billion dollars) to make a what amounted to the Russian Gone with the Wind and you get a bit of everything, from 1960s David Lean epic blockbuster filmmaking, 1920s silent cinema montage experimentation, almost Brian de Palma esque split screens and even a bit of frame splicing.

Or anything by Kalatozov and his DP Urushevsky that kinda looks like an early try at the wide-angle hand held with crazy oners style that got hip in the last 10 years. The oners in Soy Cuba are out of this world.

Or Eisenstein who, beyond his theoretical work, is, for all intents and purposes, the grandaddy of action filmmaking, just take a look at Battleship Potemkin or Alexander Nevsky to find out why.",2022-02-27 18:10:45

dh1prh,"Outline sounds like we will be getting the Sherlock accent, with a dash of PotC adventure.

From CBM:
>Robert Downey Jr. electrifies one of literature’s most enduring characters in a vivid reimagining of the classic tale of the man who could talk to animals: Dolittle.

>After losing his wife seven years earlier, the eccentric Dr. John Dolittle (Downey), famed doctor and veterinarian of Queen Victoria’s England, hermits himself away behind the high walls of Dolittle Manor with only his menagerie of exotic animals for company. But when the young queen (Jessie Buckley, Wild Rose) falls gravely ill, a reluctant Dolittle is forced to set sail on an epic adventure to a mythical island in search of a cure, regaining his wit and courage as he crosses old adversaries and discovers wondrous creatures.

>The doctor is joined on his quest by a young, self-appointed apprentice (Dunkirk’s Harry Collett) and a raucous coterie of animal friends, including an anxious gorilla (Oscar® winner Rami Malek), an enthusiastic but bird-brained duck (Oscar® winner Octavia Spencer), a bickering duo of a cynical ostrich (The Big Sick’s Kumail Nanjiani) and an upbeat polar bear (John Cena, Bumblebee) and a headstrong parrot (Oscar® winner Emma Thompson), who serves as Dolittle’s most trusted advisor and confidante.

>The film also stars Antonio Banderas, Michael Sheen (The Queen) and Oscar® winner Jim Broadbent and features additional voice performances from Oscar® winner Marion Cotillard, Frances de la Tour, Carmen Ejogo, Ralph Fiennes, Selena Gomez, Tom Holland, and Craig Robinson.

>Directed by Academy Award® winner Stephen Gaghan (Syriana, Traffic), Dolittle is produced by Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum under their Roth/Kirschenbaum Films (Alice in Wonderland, Maleficent) and Susan Downey (Sherlock Holmes franchise, The Judge) for Team Downey. The film is executive produced by Robert Downey Jr., Sarah Bradshaw (The Mummy, Maleficent) and Zachary Roth (Maleficent: Mistress of Evil).",2019-10-13 03:21:11

“Yes, exactly, it is very much like that. You see the same theme in ""At Play in the Fields of the Lord"" and also ""The Emerald Forest,"" which maybe thematically isn't that connected but it did have that clash of civilizations or of cultures. That was another reference point for me. There was some beautiful stuff in that film. I just gathered all this stuff in and then you look at it through the lens of science fiction and it comes out looking very different but is still recognizable in a universal story way. It's almost comfortable for the audience – ""I know what kind of tale this is."" They're not just sitting there scratching their heads, they're enjoying it and being taken along. And we still have turns and surprises in it, too, things you don't see coming. But the idea that you feel like you are in a classic story, a story that could have been shaped by Rudyard Kipling or Edgar Rice Burroughs.”

8bylwy,"*Incredibles 2 (or as I like to call it “More Incredible Yt Pepo 2”) continues the tired stereotype that proud Women Of Color are nothing more than shrill nagging voices to be heard but never seen, driving their husbands away and into the arms of the super nice and super cool yt family down the street.  Why can’t we see Frozone’s wife?  Why can’t we have a WOC Superhero?  We have plenty of yt pepo superheroes in the film, both men and women, young and old.  We even have a Man Of Color: Frozone, the Incredibles’ sassy black sidekick and ice minstrel, coming to help his masters at their every beck and call.  But Frozone’s wife?  Not only does this proud WOC not get to join the team and develop her own super powers, she doesn’t even get seen on screen.  Why?  Is she too shapely for their little superhero team?  Does her naturally voluptuous figure somehow threaten the sexual appeal of twig-like yt woman Invisigirl?  Maybe it’s time for a fat black woman superhero.  Also, can we talk for a minute about how Frozone’s wife’s entire character is nothing more than a single gag and not even a funny one at that.  The audience LAUGHS at this beautiful woman’s pain as she just wants her husband, her man, to stay in with her and fulfill HER needs for once instead of going out and playing superhero with his yt friends.  The audience LAUGHS at her for trying to stand up for herself and express HER needs.  It’s disgusting.  I walked out of the theater literally shaking with anger and pain for this poor Woman Of Color.  Trapped in her home while her husband is out with another woman (a yt woman nonetheless and her entire yt family).  Listen, I am not asking for much.  My request is very simple.  Disney/Pixar need to kill off all the yt Incredibles and introduce a new family of beautiful humans with a 👏🏾 little 👏🏾 more 👏🏾 melanin 👏🏾 in their skin.  Also, ditch the very aggressively yt european name “The Incredibles” and change the last name to something more modern and ethnically sensitive for this new family: Something like the “Those Fantassyquess” or something.  That’s literally all we’re asking.  Is that really too hard?*",2018-04-13 14:25:57

Probably not, since there are no national teams playing in the World Series.

No, because the best talent in the world comes to MLB to play lol.

They have the thing you're talking about, it's called the World Baseball Classic. And most of the players are in the Major or Minor Leagues.

This is going to blow your mind even more, ready:

First off, I’m so sorry for your losses. Process your feelings on your own clock, like you said. I am sorry about your diagnoses, and hope you are doing what you want to your best ability.

My dad died in 2016, and we were estranged because he thought I should bootstrap myself out of opioid addiction, I disagreed, and went with methadone.  Didn’t talk from 2009 until 2016. 

When his siblings arrived, they went to the church where he spent his last year. All of a sudden, I was the bad one who was only thinking about money.  All I wanted was one of his dobros, since he nurtured my musicality and we played bluegrass together when I was young.  

Some guy from the church he went to in his last year staked a claim on both his guitars with “ oh he gave my son lessons and said he could have it”. 

Didn’t get any ashes.  Just was told to take what what was left, after everyone else picked ( pun not intended, but dad loved puns) through his stuff.  No picks either, the kid took those, too. 

So I have a box of stuff that feels like him, but not him. 

His funeral pics were all of his last year, at that church.  A few pics of me, one of my brother, and one of my mom and he when they got married in ‘79. 

Still haven’t processed or really grieved because of all the fucked up-ness of my dads siblings and church people, who I guess turned against me because of his rigid thinking of my recovery. 

Fuck funerals.  Stupid status symbols of who loved who more.  Waste of money and resources.

I’ve become death positive, and I hope everyone gets over the death stigma.  It’s beautiful, natural, and I am excited about what happens after. Hopefully nothing. Life is exhausting. Funeral homes are ripoffs. When my MIL died, my partner’s brothers got taken for the whole shebang at the funeral home, even though I was loud with “EMBALMING ISN’T REQUIRED BY LAW”, and “who cares how fancy her casket is. She doesn’t need any blankets or pillows,” I yelled. They didn’t listen and it was $25,000 total.  The brothers could’ve taken a trip to honor their mom, but they thought she was looking down.

Throw some mycelium on me, put some dirt and nutrients, and leave me to my Mother Nature.  Apparently, according to some, I might contribute more in death than life.  Which is fine, I was always a “no good junkie” and I hate people anyway. 

TLDR funerals suck, people suck, and the stigma around death sucks. 

Fuzzy, I wish you the best in everything you do. If you need an ear, drop a misanthropic line, and we can bitch together about how much our species sucks right now. ✨love to you✨ and fuck everyone else🥰",2022-01-21 18:50:11

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theological history most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.

As a consequence people who dislike mother! truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in J.

Renting Ocarina of Time and staying up late, realizing the potential of video games (and turning me into a hopeless Nintendo fanboy and Zelda freak even to this day). Late nights with Banjo and Kazooie. My subscription to Nintendo Power and getting hyped for all the upcoming releases (like the first teases of Majora's Mask). Speaking of Majora's Mask, that was the first game I got on launch and I ordered the special edition through Nintendo (back when they did that) and it arrived in the mail right around Halloween and that was basically how I spent that entire fall.

His legs are bowed, his back is bent, he seems stiff and jerky. This guy is an absolute all-time favorite of mine, but I wouldn't get your hopes up for his old, knock-em-down, jumping off buildings kind of action.

The man's getting older, and I think his stunts and such are catching up with him. I wish we could have him forever, but man I wish he'd take it easy and just retire. I don't want him to beat himself or make his body any worse. 😕",2017-06-22 08:36:27

Secondly, he makes part of his dialogues hard to hear on purpose so that people will actually pay attention to the movie and he respects his audience enough to not treat them like children and have to spoon feed every little thing to them....

I hear everything in his movies just fine, and I have bad hearing, so I guess the mass audience of people seeing movies are just ignorant and or borderline deaf, and as mentioned, need things spoon fed to them like children 🤷‍♂️

I won't say there's no issues with psychiatry but Scientology's beef with it goes way beyond having a few issues with it. Look into Hubbard and his life. Dude was no doubt highly intelligent, but an excentric-turned-total mess.  There's an interesting biography called ""Bare-faced Messiah"" that... well, you can tell from the title it's not exactly church™-endorsed.

hq9jox,"By the time we convinced him to go to the doctor it had spread through his lymph nodes, to his liver, and there was a significant scare about it spreading to his lungs. They were able to remove a large amount of his liver, which grows itself back eventually, removed a large section of his colon but not enough to necessitate a colostomy, and he did several years of chemo through a port that they had surgically installed in his chest.

It was scary as hell, he was also going through a opioid withdrawal based on how messed up our pain management clinics are in Indiana, and it was just rough over all. It's been 5 years, no return of cancer ever, port removed, all the pain meds he thought he needed are no longer in the picture, and it's really just a miracle and testament to how much we've advanced with medicine and cancer research in the past few decades.

It's funny that as much of an overall Nolan fan I am...I still haven't seen Memento.  And yes, Nolan's never really made an outright bad movie.  Nolan is kind of like Michael Jackson.  People talked about how his Dangerous album proved he fell off.  But sales-wise it did fantastic, just not as good as Thriller and Bad.  But MJ's ""low-point"" still outdid a majority of the albums released that year.

That's Nolan.  His average still beats out someone else's best and his best is friggin' dynamite.  So yeah, I like Nolan tons too.  Not blindly but def a fan.  

>But like Fincher, he's never really made a bad movie.

So you're on the record stating Alien3 is at least decent to good then, yeah?  😁

zm8zl3,"As sad as it may be to lose hold of the Superman role, I am glad that Henry finally can move on. 

From the looks of it, the old guard never really appreciated him in that role and didn't respect him enough to be honest and transparent with him.

Telling him to announce his return to the role while searching for their ""Fiege"" was an absolute shitty thing to do. Yeah, maybe WB had legit intent on pursuing a new MoS movie, but they had to have some awareness that it could likely be derailed by whomever they hired to shape the DCEU into the future.  Or maybe they just wanted some clickbait floating around the interwebs for the sake of publicity after the mediocre landing of Black Adam?🤔

Henry = the standup dude that sticks around with a shitty, toxic partner because he sees the amazing person that partner could potentially become.

WB = the shitty, toxic partner that will likely never change

eckx4x,"I am a borderline obsessive fan of the stage musical, having com across it originally at a rather.....formative time in my life (and I'm a big musical theatre fan anyway) and I've been extremely apprehensive about this since the first trailer I saw.

Like, I probably will go to see it, and I'll probably enjoy it well enough because it will have all the songs and what tiny bits of dancing we see in the trailer still looks like the dancing I love but......god, even in the trailer linked in the OP that bit with Corden (who I don't automatically hate) going ""*Hiss*, that's what I say to you, *hiss*"" is just....like....oh god no. One, its a standard human-approximating-a-cat hiss and with all the other computer effects going on I really think they could have dubbed in an actual cat hiss if they really felt the need and two that just is so, so, so far removed from *anything* that Bustopher Jones as characterised in Eliot's poems and hence the stage show would do!! He's the epitome of upper class Gentlemen's Club cat! (yes, I know how utterly insane I must sound discussing characters that are literally entirely composed of one poem and its musical portrayal as if they have solidified personalities, but I am attempting to give the impression of the kind of person you'd otherwise expect to love the film 😉)

Ditto Rebel Wilson, in her standard Comedy Fat Girl personality, is *not* Jennyanydots.

And Bombalurina (the Taylor Swift character) is an important nurturing and guiding second-in-command of the Jellicles, not a slutty, one-hit-wonder, Mean Girl.

Hooper seems to have confused the largely non-sexual furpile sensuality of the stage production with sexuality in a lot of places, which is also just.....off base. Yes, the kittens and younger females are flirty with Tugger, and there's some sexual undertones to some of the winding and moving and touching but mostly the stage choreography just beautifully captures the easy tactileness of bonded cats (as someone who danced for 12 years and has had actual cats all her life I can honestly say Gillian Lynne was a bona fide genius choreographer).

But yeah, this is going to bomb. Huge fans of the stage show might go and see it once just to see is it really as bad as it looks, but moderate fans probably won't bother. And non-fans of the stage show - well, some will go precisely because they're hoping it is as bad as it looks and to, I don't know, punish themselves the same way we go to horror movies to be scared and grossed out, but most will be completely put off by these reviews.

And it missed all the awards deadlines too.

A lonely bloke takes it upon himself to wake up somebody who thinks they are gonna sleep for a hundred years or so because he fancies her. 

He gives absolutely no thought to the fact he has shortened her life, he gives no thought to the fact that she may not actually like him, but she’s now put in a position where her only choice is literally the last man available, who then courts/grooms her into never actually taking him to task over his abhorrent actions.

wq5308,"I think it's a particularly western mindset (perhaps Disney..) which requires a protagonist to be a Good Person^TM. Or to scold and lecture like a gradeschool teacher and blatantly point out that they are a Bad Person^TM, and not to be at all sympathized with.

I remember liking the movie. It's nothing like what you'd call fine cinema. Just a mostly forgettable sci-fi shipwreck yarn. At least it attempted to explore real human fallibility instead of the usual Hollywood glamorous Flawed Hero^TM qualities that usually just boil down to being irresponsible, impolite, and inconsiderate (but in, like, a badass way though 😎😎) 

It did a passable job of describing how deep despair can go, and drive people (and indeed ourselves) to do awful things. People we otherwise find kind and likeable. The Bad Things^TM that we knowingly do to people around us, who we imperfectly care about. Things that we feel shame for doing, and feel even more shame for knowing deep down a part of us is glad we did it. 

Granted, very few of us have consigned anyone to a life of confinement - but fewer have traveled between the stars. Countless more have drowned their rescuers in frantic desperation, as Laurence Fischburne said in the film. An irreducible human condition, you might say. An uncomfortable darkness worth exploring, you might think. But that might just be ""Old Man Wisdom"" talking. Better disregard it  :\^)

It's not Dosteovsky, but it was something. It was mostly quite superficial. They certainly could have done a lot more with the premise. But I got more than what I was expecting. It made me think and feel something, even just a bit. Enough to remember it after six or seven years.

It seems to me just a little childish to be upset that the almighty writer didn't strike Chris Pratt down for his sins like some kind of Old Testament God, or care enough about Jennifer Lawrence's professional aspirations.",2022-08-17 05:13:12

dbd0d0,">Lord of the Rings movies are epic-action adventures too and they've been nominated and awarded. Same with Mad Max, Black Panther, Avatar, and Gladiator. 

None of these are pure action or spy/thriller genre, so they can get awarded for visual effects which proper action films can't. And they're oscar bait, especially lotr.

>Then you're still wrong. Your claim talked about audience preference and critic preference. If you actually click on ""more info"" it shows that Amer... blah blah blah... 

...click on more info... delve into the detailed stats to try and make this as confusing as possible... Simply put: Skyfall: 92%, American Beauty: 88%. A higher percentage of people enjoyed Skyfall. That's all that matters. Not the ""average rating"", or how many gave it 5 stars, 4 stars etc...

>All modern Bond films fall in the same vein as summer blockbusters. It's about the type of flick that it is, not which season it comes out. 

Summer blockbusters are cgi heavy, DUMB action movies, ones with no real message or meaning or value. Cheap entertainment. The complete opposite of the Bond franchise.

>LOL, no. Again, audiences rated American Beauty more highly on both metacritic and RT

Nothing to do with Skyfall's status as an action classic but ok...

>LOL. American Beauty has been such a cultural hit that it skyrocketed Spacey's career and has been parodied in a variety of genres and other films, especially the rose petal imagery. 

Ok great! Maybe so. Still has less of an impact that Skyfall that's all.

Movies are a business first and an art form second. We can all sit around and dream about a world where that isn’t true but it’ll still be a dream at the end of the day.

kxb3f6,The Rambo films are badass. Last Blood is a picky subject for me because I got nauseous and fainted when it came to the sex trafficking scenes😵 but I did like the whole home alone aspect of the climax and then him literally cutting out the guy's heart and showing him only seconds before he died😁,2021-01-15 03:22:44
kxb3f6,"All these years and I was the only person I knew that absolutely loves First Blood and hates every other ""Rambo"" movie. Finally! I'm not alone anymore 😂",2021-01-15 03:24:00
kxb3f6,I was blown away when I first saw Rambo 1. I didn't expect it to be some social drama. 🤗,2021-01-15 08:22:22
kxb3f6,">resilient myths about the Vietnam War, such as that American POWs were still there after the war

Agree 💯 with everything you said. The whiplash between Rambo 1 & 2 struck me too as a kid growing up in the 80s.

That being said, it's not clear the abandoned POWs was a myth. The account by Haney in ""Inside Delta Force"" (one of its original members) is pretty detailed, & full of corroborative evidence. The whole affair changed him from being the jingoistic nationalist you describe, into someone who quit the army.",2021-01-15 12:41:51
kxb3f6,My cousin was in that and I idolized him for it. It was a background cameo. 😆,2021-01-15 01:21:03

8i1lee,Of course white people will call this racist. They'll do anything to undermine black films because they'll never be able to accept the fact that there is STILL a serious issue involving racist white people in America and that they are a HUGE part of the problem.

I always used to think sign language was a universal language (or at least global perhaps, hehe). It's so interesting and cool that there are different languages and accents and dialects though, also not surprising once I stop and think about it. Do you think there could ever be a global sign language or do the different versions differ from each other too much? In my naive mind I think a common sign language could potentially be the key to everyone on earth being able to understand each other (and thus, get along in harmony!) 😊",2018-04-08 04:27:59

5ql1sj,"So, so sad to hear about the loss of John Hurt.

I actually had the unique pleasure of interviewing him as part of some university work experience. He was in Cardiff giving a workshop to young, aspiring actors and I was trying my best to cut it as a boom operator, despite having no idea what I was doing.

Our interview wasn't the most professional and it was clear that he was tired from the long day but he was still incredibly friendly and enthusiastic to talk to us. He wasn't just there as some favour to a friend, you could tell he cared about the next generation of actors.

I wish I knew where the recordings were as he came out with some cracking pearls of wisdom. One line did stay with me though;

""If you do not try, you cannot succeed""

Looking back at it written down it's an incredibly simple phrase but coming from this man, it was inspirational. It was also like talking to your grandad, because he was so warm and open, so his words really had an impact.

My uni experience was mostly forgettable but this was an invaluable opportunity and interaction that I'll never forget.

When are they gonna learn that people don’t like this pandering crap? I’m a woman btw, but first I’m a person. All I care about is good characters and a good story. I’m not saying this will definitely be bad, it’s just that the track record for these kinds of things lately definitely is bad. 

Alien was never touted as a female centered sci fi, it was that, but that wasn’t the point of its existence and it’s still an amazing movie today. These days they just can’t seem to make it work. Making the force female to fulfill some deluded fantasy of Kathleen Kennedy’s practically killed Star Wars. It’s like they were so concerned with making the lead a girl that they forgot how to tell a coherent story and write characters that anyone could actually care about. So many female-centered movies and tv shows are just failing and the failure is not due to the fact that the star is female, it’s that the characters (and in some cases the casting) are terribly unlikeable. 

To be fair the latest Spider-Man movies have been fantastic and Tom Holland is absolutely perfect casting. Maybe this FEMALE CENTERED Spider-WOman might work, I’d be pleasantly surprised if they could actually pull it off. I just hope it isn’t all about how little miss perfect spider girl does everything right and her male counterparts serve as either the butt to every joke or a nasty villain of some sort.

Females are human too, please try doing us a favor and write a decent character for once.",2020-08-20 08:25:42

g6wsr0,"I mean the thing about comedy and humour is it’s completely subjective, and ive always personally found that as soon as something goes mainstream it starts to pander to a specific audience, and it looses its charm.

There will always be people who find sienfeld/friends/big bang theory funny, and there will always be people that hate them, but every generation seems to have at least ONE show that follows the same pattern, just updated for the times it airs in. Sienfeld was a quirky show when it aired and was refreshing to a lot of people, but almost anyone who watches more than 5-7 episodes in a row, kinda realizes the formula never changes and it gets kinda stale.

The thing about the shows i mentioned is that they all were funny *enough* to watch without thinking too hard and get one or two chuckles an episode, but after they took off and became popular they lost almost all of what made the show special in the first place, replacing that charm with stale jokes and repetitiveness in the interest of taking off. All of these shows in my opinion have funny moments, but aren’t inherently funny, yet seem to be funny enough to casually watch, while also not insulting to anyone’s intelligence or characteristics, making it perfect for mainstream success

eu9atl,"The ones regarding the prequels ""fondly"" are those who grew up with them (it was 1999, remember).  The ones regarding them as better than what we've got lately might be who you are actually referring to.

They are, of course, justified.  The prequels were cohesive; the """"Skywalker"""" trilogy was not.  The prequels weren't trying to sell something more than entertainment to the audience, because that simply wasn't a thing back then.  The prequels didn't literally waste good actors on hopeless fumbling.  And nobody involved with the prequels (other than perhaps Christopher Lee 😉) immediately went on record as saying they would never work with Lucas again, like before the last movie was even out.

The ones who understand this context and regard the prequels as superior are justified.",2020-01-27 00:39:21

If that idiot didn't shoot up a movie theater, Nolan wouldve gotten an Oscar...and still definitely deserves one. TDKR is such a heavy film, but Nolan manages to end it on such a bright note.

ap133s,I feel like Greg realized after staring in the Room that he had no chance of being taken seriously. Now he's full on the Tommy train 😂😂,2019-02-10 21:38:54
ap133s," SOME INTERESTING TOMMY WISEAU FACTOIDS ARE BELOW:

 The fact that Greg Sestero is still helping Tommy out is incredible. Tommy seems like an extremely difficult human being to work with. 

 Tommy Wiseau used to sell stuff from a cart on the street in LA. 

 Apparently he came over from Eastern Europe with what some think was ill-gotten mob money and he tried and failed to set himself up with several businesses in America (while pretending to be a born and bred American from Louisiana, no less). 

 Wiseau means something along the lines of ""bird-man."" Apparently this nickname was given to Tommy Wiseau while he was vending on the streets of LA. Tommy's real name is likely ""Wieczor"" (credit to redditor ohbaimark). 

 The theories about where he got his money range from the likely (mob money from back home) to the absurd (he's really FB Cooper, famed airplane robber who parachuted out of a plane with $200,000). There are a few theories in between, like that of a redditor who believes that Tommy's money came from a settlement from a car accident, and the possibility that Tommy's retail career is more lucrative than any of us realize (not likely), but no one really knows for sure. His latest retail venture is a unisex underwear company. He takes it VERY seriously 😂.

 Tommy Wiseau loved/hated James Franco's hilariously awkward biopic, The Disaster Artist, which was based on Greg Sestero's book of the same name, The Disaster Artist. While Wiseau loves being adored and seen in the limelight, he HATES being called out on some of his more blatant lies. 

 Speaking of blatant lies, pparently Tommy pretends to be a good 20 years younger than he actually is. From the information I can find (I did an episode of my psychology podcast on Wiseau), he is in his mid-to-late sixties. 

 While Mr. Wiseau plays into the camp surrounding The Room nowadays, apparently he was deeply offended upon its original theatrical release that people didn't take his movie more seriously. He considered it to be the great American movie. 

A young fan recently tried to do a biographical feature with Tommy, and Tommy freaked out when the fan didn't want to cite Tommy's...er...edited personal background as fact and threw a bunch of lawyers at him who conjured several injunctions and orders to cease and desist. Working with Tommy Wiseau sounds like an absolute nightmare. I still enjoy watching The Room, though, and The Disaster Artist. And I'll probably watch this too (God help me) 😂😂. 

Are you planning to watch Wiseau's new movie? Comment why or why not. I've always been the lone ironic Wiseau fan in my friend group and I love that I've found more of you to get weird with. ",2019-02-10 14:39:15

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theological linguistics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Gollum's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Lord of the Rings truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Sam's existencial catchphrase ""FRODO!!,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as J.R.R. Tolkien's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Lord of the Rings tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

“It’s a delight (and a little relieved) to finally be able say we have an official release date for our movie Mortal Kombat! It’s coming atcha April 16, 2021 🐉

Directed by Simon McQuoid @simonmcquoid with James Wan @creepypuppet as Executive Producer, we’ve made a film that will live up to the action packed bloodbath that Ed Boon and John Tobias when they conceived of the first Mortal Kombat video game over 30 years ago.

This is a work of blood sweet and tears (all very literal and too often real) by a diverse cast that truly represent the people on Earth...and some other realms too...I dunno about superheroes, but I’m pretty damn sure we are SUPER BADASS.

It is my honor to be Liu Kang, whom Robin Shou portrayed in the original Mortal Kombat. It left an indelible mark on me then and I aim to keep that fire burning.

The tournament is about to begin. See y’all there!

amr7kt,"Fun Fact. In Islam, Satan/Lucifer is NOT a fallen angel but part of a different creation all together known as the Jinn. That's actually from where the word Geanie came From (and no they don't live in lamps or grant wishes). They are creatures made from smokeless fire that we cannot see but live amongst us and some are even Muslim. And some are evil or unbelievers. Satan is the highest of the Jinn. He was so high in fact that he achieved the same status as Angels before his fall after refusing to bow before Adam (The 1st Man) as all other Angels were commanded to do by God, in Heaven (Paradise/Janna). It was basically racism. Due to arrogance and pride, He complained why should he bow down to a lesser creature since he was made of fire while Adam was made from clay. And due to his disobedience, he was commanded to the Hellfire. But he made a request (prayer if you will) to God before his eternal refuge in Hell, to delay his punishment until the end of Time so that he may attack Mankind from all directions on God's ""Straight Path"" and show God that they are not grateful nor obedient to God's Will. He was granted his request and on the Day of Judgement, when Mankind goes to blame Satan for their grave sins, he will reply ""I but merely whispered, you did the actions"". Just a short taste into his story guys. Sorry to get all theological on y'all. Forgive me if I came across as preachy, that's not my intent. I tried to be neutral and paraphrase what we Muslims believe without embellishments. Salaam (Peace!✌)",2019-02-04 14:27:37

This isn’t a case of “the government sucks but the people are just lovely 🥰”. Go to r/saudiarabia and find some posts about LGBT people, you can see what the average citizen thinks for yourself. They aren’t forced to be terrible people there or anything. 

Perhaps it is true that the average citizen there couldn’t change their government’s position if they wanted to, but that’s the thing: they have to actually want to first. And right now, the situation is such that even if their government **were** in favor of human rights for LGBT people, there would be protests in the streets for them to *reverse* that. And then they’d make excuses for it and say “it’s just a cultural difference, bro”. 

If it’s possible for a government to have shitty positions on an issue, it’s not somehow magically impossible for a whole nation to have a shitty position too because humans are inherently good people or something.

Jack was more of a ""major role comedic relief"" if it's allowed to call it that.

In the sequels the Will / Elizabeth story archs pretty much devolved into literally nothing and Jack took the main lead.

While he is fun to watch, just Jack alone as the main star doesnt make for an interesting movie IMO.

wu5trt,">To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand A Goofy Movie. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of family psychology most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Goofy's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Freudian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike A Goofy Movie truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Goofy's existencial catchphrase ""Gawrsh,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Chris Matheson's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have an A Goofy Movie tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Disclaimer: I actually like his movies. I watch them. I buy his shit so... I'm still going to be objective 

I hope the guy has already earned a Billi for his great grand kids.

At some point people started saying. A Tom Cruise movie staring as himself. That is The Rock. The character he created is basically the same one in most if not all his movies. Same with K.Hart. Save for the latest Netflix movie he starred in with Snipes. 

I'm okay with taking a break from The Rock. I'll still watch his movies when they come out. But, I wouldn't be mad if he shifted gears for a while

❤️Down voters ❤️to a fan that can still critique. Hats off to you. I accept them with my morning workouts.🥰😘😘

a9tdgn,"It just never really took off on a real mental level. Nothing is given enough details or explained. It's sci-fi in the way that Starbuck in Battlestar Galactica (BSG) dies, comes back, kicks ass, and then disappears angel style right before the show concludes without any explanation. It just is.

I liked this movie and BSG. But the former as a standalone is definitely nothing to write home about. There's a reason one of the most memorable parts of the movie is this scene (which is more horror than SciFi) and not the actual plot.

Edit: grammar
Edit 2: BSG acronym 🙄",2018-12-27 00:46:08

Sure it has Walberg in it, but his sisters in the movie and mom are the most accurate portrayal of Lowell/the North Shore in the 90s I think ever. To the point I had to check if they were even actors or just people they literally pulled off the street in Lowell (which they did with other characters)

And its because they're not all somewhat pretty actresses (no offense to them, their acting was also spot on) that makes it so real. Even Amy Adam's is somehow downgraded in that movie.

Not saying Bam also couldn’t have been a dick and they’re right, but to look at the hundreds of you IMMEDIATELY jumping to shit on Bam (WHO IS STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION AND WAS ESSENTIALLY FORCED TO MAKE A MOVIE DURING SAID ADDICTION BECAUSE IM SURE HE NEEDED THE MONEY, AND YOU KNOW TREMAINE AND MTV DIDNT GIVE A FLYING FUCK ABOUT HIS PROBLEMS AS LONG AS HE WAS IN THE MOVIE) is fucking pathetic and y’all should be ashamed of yourself 

Top comment on bams Instagram video in article is “this is blatant addict behavior” 

I’ve been an addict for over 20 years, if that’s BLATANT addict behavior, than 80% of humans on the planet are full blown addicts 

The video is simply Bam telling everyone exactly what I just said, which is he’s going through shit, and THEY knew this, and signed him onto the movie, (keep n mind this is JACKASS we are talking about 🙄) and are now reneging on the deal

Addiction or not, someone would be rightfully pissed about this 

You all TRULY don’t believe this franchise had an issue the first 3 movies when Bam was loaded out of his mind??? Oh and let’s not forget your boy STEVE-O who was UNDOUBTEDLY more loaded than any human being on the planet for these movies….

Y’all are a joke 

You all talk in other threads about how we should be supporting these people and this and that, and then when it’s the other way around, you have no qualms with shifting your narrative, like it’s night and day

nr6qj2,"It's so wild when it's people you've known your whole life

My nephew's druggy dad and his druggy wife are like this. Always bouncing between posts about how much they love or hate each other

One time, drug dad did a shitload of meth and got into a standoff with the cops. Drug wife spent the whole standoff posting about how ""he fought in Iraq he's allowed to do what he wants!"" Then she posted a video calling him a pussy for being arrested instead of going down fighting

After like 2 months of him being locked up, she started posting about how dumb he was to think he could take the cops, how hard it is paying the bills alone. Then she posted pics in bed with other dudes. So he started posting dick pics on her page using his black market jail cell phone. She mocked it at first, but by the end she was posting his dick pics and saying ""X months till I gag on this 😍"" and that was when I deleted my Facebook",2021-06-03 12:54:10

Which the kids do anyway. The V-Chip used to mean something now it's not even mentioned. Parents need to do their job as parents not being so focused on their job and letting a nanny or the Internet/ TV babysit their kids. This trend needs to stop. Society won't have such a problem with seeing the past and learning from it instead of being so critical about it. Grow up and face the fact that the world is dark and the Walt Disney Company was apart of so much.

By the time they were done every penny of profit magically disappeared and I never saw a cent. They folded shortly after that and the money for the last ski doc I planned on making went with it.

Here's a fact: whoever signed off on that idea is *jobless* right now,  and will stay that way if they ever admit it to anyone.  
This movie never had a chance: the original was a classic, but a classic for reasons nobody could really put their finger on. Why it was so popular is still kind of a wonder.  
A movie like that should be absolutely the last movie on your list when deciding to do remakes or sequels.

It’s easily his top 3 best movie ever made...objectively 

AMAZING dialogue as always, amazing cinematography, amazing meta in depth shit like Leo playing an actor playing an actor, amazing cast, amazing director, amazing ending.... I mean...

People get entrenched with things they love, yet also want their favorite artist to evolve, when one does such things, they turn on them immediately, it’s hilarious 

Not saying Tarantino was trying to evolve a whole lot in that film or had such intentions, but it seems to be the vast majority that don’t like the movie, had no idea who Sharon Tate was or even what the Manson murders were 

Which still to this day I scratch my head about. My parents weren’t even boring when that shit happened, and yet I knew all about this story and the people, longggg before smartphones and WiFi was a thing....

Back to ppl getting entrenched. They romanticize older stuff like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs so much, and for so long, that they see something completely new and in a different light, as shitty or sucks 🤷‍♂️ 

It can be argued every single movie he’s made is a home run, whether you like it or not

Side note: most ppl are severely adhd these days because of social media/smart phones, so any movie that has lots of dialogue is going to immediately not set well with them, not to mention it’s set in the 60’s which the youth of today couldn’t give two fucks about, since if something is older than 5 minutes ago it’s considered “lame”",2020-09-02 09:34:26

9fzld5,君の名は (Your Name). Best Japanese animated movie I've seen. Beautiful visuals and such a smart plot. 👍,2018-09-15 10:53:21

9fzld5,"The Return of the King, The Dark Knight, and Interstellar each do this for me. Opening night for TDK was intense. Each scene with Ledger gave me goosebumps, not to mention the uneasy way the movie moves along- great fucking movie. Talked about it for weeks, no other movie seemed to interest me for awhile. Return of the King was simply epic. The conclusion to a beautifully displayed on screen adventure- “for Frodo” 😟.
Interstellar by far is the one movie that left the biggest impression on me. I felt so overwhelmed, so small and insignificant while also feeling inspired and amazed. Trying to wrap my head around the possibilities discoveries of future space exploration... just wow. ",2018-09-15 11:43:53

Unfortunately now also they have a “ The Dolphin and Beluga Interaction Program” (swim with the Belugas &  🐬 )
In the wild, dolphins can travel up to 80 miles a day at speeds of almost 20 miles per hour. Life in a tank causes stress and neurotic behaviors, such as swimming in endless circles. Also those animals often suffer of sunburn because the tanks are small and not enough deep.

ixvpd9,Honestly thought these live remakes were gonna be as close to the original movies. I mean.. they could've done that and with a solid cast probably made decent movies.

The issues in it aren’t as blatantly obvious as in the Disney trilogy but like what you said, there’s a ton of those little details that ultimately turn the movie into just whatever instead of as great as it could’ve been. When Jyn gets to the top of the tower she watches an xwing take down a TIE striker and she’s just kinda like 😑 she doesn’t feel pressured to complete her mission she doesn’t feel the clock ticking down or anything like she would if the dogfight had gone the other way. This is the finale, THIS IS IT! It’s all or nothing now and she just gets to blankly Stare at the rebellion kicking ass instead of feeling like this is her one and only chance to exact revenge on the regime that broke her family and ruined her life. Then cassian magically saves her from krennic (who was also undeveloped) and Jyn doesn’t get to speak for the rest of the movie. That’s it, nothing else from our protagonist.

How long have theaters been a thing throughout history? People don’t go for the movie necessarily, it’s for the experience. I don’t like to go to the theaters myself but as soon as me and everyone else is vaccinated I plan on going because it’s been so long and I *miss the experience.* I don’t care how nice your home theater is it will never be the same. If anything, (purely IMO) streaming is going to die because they keep splitting into smaller and smaller streaming services. I don’t want to pay $10 for 7 different streaming services.

&#x200B;

Granted, many have said this about multiple characters adapting superheroes (Remember when Hugh Jackman was first announced as Wolverine). But in my experience, most Marvel-related casts for lead characters have succeeded.

&#x200B;

Within moments even in trailers, I saw Jackman as Logan, Patrick Stewart as Xavier, Wesley Snipes as Blade, RDJ as Tony, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha, Tom Holland as Peter, etc.

&#x200B;

Here, I just can't see it yet in Larson's look, build, or demeanor (To be fair, Jackman was tall for Logan, not saying body type makes or breaks it). In terms of quality actresses who could fulfill at least capturing Captain Marvel's silhouette:

&#x200B;

I could've seen Katheryn Winnick, Yvonne Strahovski,  Evan Rachel Wood, Jessica Brown Findlay, January Jones, or possibly Rebecca Ferguson (though I suspect she'd be pre-occupied for now with the **Mission: Impossible** series) pulling it off. 

&#x200B;

**Just a few options off the top of my head. I'm definitely open to Brie proving me wrong in the full movie but first impressions make a big difference in marketing (especially for the superhero genre) and she's not off to the best start.**",2018-09-19 21:55:46

My favorite part from the linked Wiki is the Disputed section:


>Kretzschmar argues that a **General American** accent is simply the ***result*** of American speakers ***suppressing regional and social features*** that have become widely noticed and stigmatized.

...
>Kretzchmar instead promotes the term **Standard American English**, which he defines as a level of American English pronunciation ***""employed by educated speakers in formal settings""***, while still being variable within the U.S. from place to place, and even from speaker to speaker.

A *result* [i.e. a product of natural social process] of shedding the *regional* [this process removes local association for--get this-- a larger area. Like, America? And there's no specification, so I guess... its just a larger, *general* area? Like *America*?

So Standard American English canonizes everyone's natural desire to optimally communicate across regions into only those who are ""educated"" and in ""formal"" settings.

General American English is a phenomenon. You were right. But valley girls exist, so you were wrong. 😋",2020-08-13 18:14:12

Do you remember the animation Crystal clearly or is it their words that you can perfectly remember? Their tone of voice, the inflection, and gravity of it? The animation is great making a movie relatable for kids. But upon rewatching you notice the struggles and hardships more. In a live-action setting you would immediately grasp those hardships. The animation conceals it. It presents it in a comforting way. It would be harder to watch as a live-action not because you’re comparing it to the animated. But because you can’t conceal the harsh reality of the world they live in. The struggles of Nani, the trauma of Lilo, and if done properly the emotions of Stitch (if they can get the team that did Detective Pikachu).

Also, everyone is sticking up for animation. I’m literally the only one defending it here. 🤨",2022-06-22 00:12:35

What's scary? The fascism part? I'm not advocating for fascism because the reality of fascism is not what the movie portrays.

I'm saying I would be down for that specific situation because in that fictional setting it's pretty comfy. No racism, sexism, wage inequality, or any suffering to speak of. Can't say that about the Land of the Free™..

And yes, there are people who *actually* think a fascist republic would be a superior form of government. I don't agree with them, but they exist and I promise they aren't scary, just wired different. 

Actually, I personally think a democratically elected dictatorship with clear constitutional term limits and checks/balances would be a superior form of government. Authoritarian monarchies become oppressive, but they are also extremely efficient. If potential tyranny could be squashed, I think it would be a highly effective way to manage society. As long as the leader is benevolent and effective, the reduction of red tape would lead to prosperity similar to what was starting to happen under Gaddafi before he was ousted for standing up to the banking system. Many dictators/monarchs have led their constituents to prosperity.

Anyway, what I said was mostly an offhand comment. I do spend some time thinking about this and for you to tell me I'm ""gross"" for entertaining an idea (especially before you have context) is itself gross.

7m1owj,"Star Wars isn’t Star Wars without George Lucas. While TFA and TLJ were great at ‘entertaining’ audiences, they did nothing it seems to set up a story. So many people I talk to talk about how they have no attachment to these new characters as people had with the Trio in the OT.  And while everyone seemed to shit on George for the PT, I feel like character wise, it was better. And that’s the driver for a story. 

These movies will make Disney money, but to me, my complete Saga will always be I - VI 

All just my personal opinion. For those watching TLJ, I hope you enjoy it 🤙",2017-12-25 17:22:03
7m1owj,How long before Rian Johnson loses the upcoming trilogy? 🤞,2017-12-25 18:24:02
7m1owj,"Am I the only one who loved the movie and understood the story Rian was trying to tell? TLJ was way more character based than any SW film before it and was really nuanced with its themes. It’s not perfect, but it’s not as bad as people are out to make it. I think if you go in watching it only expecting to find out that Rey’s a Kenobi, Snoke is Plaguies, and that Luke is going to be a badass from the start then yeah you’re going to be disappointed. I love what Rian did with the characters and I think a lot of people are mostly upset because their own theories didn’t work out. I literally binged all 8 movies and The Clone Wars/Rebels right before Ep 8 and it all fits and makes total sense to me. I’m really excited to see what’s in store for Ep 9. I really hope time will be kinder to TLJ. People shit on TFA for being a copy cat but when they get something new they hate that too. I really think if we went back in time for the release of Jedi all you’d see is people screaming about how the Emporer got killed so easily! I’m sure this will get majorly downvoted, but I gotta represent for those SW fans out there who actually enjoy TLJ. 🤷🏾‍♂️ I’m seeing it for a 3rd time next week and look forward to it.

7z0sj5,"I'm reminded of Roger Ebert's review of Transformers 2.
>""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a horrible experience of unbearable length, briefly punctuated by three or four amusing moments. One of these involves a dog-like robot humping the leg of the heroine. Such are the meager joys. If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination.

>The plot is incomprehensible. The dialog of the Autobots®, Decepticons® and Otherbots® is meaningless word flap. Their accents are Brooklyese, British and hip-hop, as befits a race from the distant stars. Their appearance looks like junkyard throw-up. They are dumb as a rock. They share the film with human characters who are much more interesting, and that is very faint praise indeed.

The son is flabbergasted at what he has heard & knows he has been groomed to be the ultimate hunter in hunting the Predator.  

Matrix/Dutch & badass son recruit a new team of super badasses whom are too dangerous to be normal soldiers thus they are in a special military prison complex.  Matrix/Dutch & badass son propose freedom but the price is too damn high.  They all agree & this new breed Dirty Dozen type team lead by Matrix/Dutch go hunting for Predator activity.

2. If Sully only had an iPhone. Instead he’s dead  because he couldn’t make a phone call on the pay phone😞. 

Which was ripped from the base barehanded!! 

3. The lady who flies the plane is getting her pilots license and has been training flying amphibious planes for how long? 

4. Rocket launcher missile causes prison van to roll and crash. And Matrix is unscathed on his way to take on 300 troops. Not even a limp!!

5. Who takes their daughter on vacation with their new lady? Your daughter just went through a traumatic event as a kidnapped hostage. It may take some time before Matrix and his new lady can have some adult sessions. I see therapy.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also TJ's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike TJ Miller truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in TJ's existencial catchphrase ""the woman on this train has a bomb,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as TJ's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Silicon Valley tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

el3gp5,"The Search *and* The Crusade squeezed into the margins of Knightfall and KnightsEnd movies? No way that pacing works. You need at least a trilogy of movies, maybe splitting KnightQuest into separate ones following Bruce and Jean-Paul. But even that feels like they'd be rushing it a bit. The ideal would be 3 seasons at 8-10 episodes per. (Jumping back and forth between the KnightQuest subplots would be less disjointing in a series.) Think about how many fucking bad guys he faces in the first half of Knightfall. That movie would still feel like it was darting from scene to scene with a 3-hour runtime.

Rock just has a broader draw  appeal because of the reasons you mentioned.  I go to see him because he’s a personality I grew up with and his movies aren’t usually bad.  And now that he’s teaming up with Kevin Hart a lot they’re usually good for some laughs a lot too.   Most if the women I’ve dated have him up there in that Brad Pitt category of guys they like to look at.  And honestly that’s awesome for me.

An artists job is not to pander to their audience, unless commissioned be someone for a specific thing, and even then, it is up to the artist to deliver THEIR vision for what that should be. But that isn't even the case here. This is a classic case of people whining that something from their past is being altered in a way that they don't like. The majority of movie consumers can't handle anything that is the least bit outside of their already packaged and easily digestible paradigm, so any deviation from that, however small, is met with constant complaining about how ""it should be the way I like it, because I know better than the people making the movie"" 🙄🙄",2019-02-12 13:46:16

    Have you never seen or heard of “Jodorowsky's Dune”?????

  Surprised to not see this in the comments (at least as far as I’ve scrolled down.)

  Watch the documentary - super rad. 

    This scenario has happened before, pre Lynch. All the talent, perfect eclectic director, etc etc. Would’ve been way cooler than this current take. I’m talking Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger, David Carradine, Orson Welles were going to be in it, Pink Floyd was doing the score. The team that was doing storyboards, set design, effects and such went on to do work on Alien, even Star Wars and more. Jodorowsky, if you’ve never seen any of his films, get on whatever you get on 😗💨and watch some of them. 
   
    I won’t tell much more, but if this new take interests you, watch this for sure. Will be interesting to see how this one turns out. ",2019-02-15 04:46:31

Are you telling me that a bunch of socially inept teenagers’ memeification of a great film that explores the roots of mental illness and violence has come to overshadow and distort the authorial intent of *Joker* to such an extent that (on Reddit) this memeification is more popular than an accurate understanding of the film itself?

Context: I was in college at the time (oh boy, dat atmosphere) and have had a strong tendency towards genuine niceness/kindness for most of my life. Enough to cause suspicion among some (e.g.: Nice Guy™). The truth is, I get pleasure out of being nice to people, especially females. Shit made my day. Learned to die it down a lot (again) to avoid the (surprise!) negative consequences, which is unfortunate considering the people I've met who *truly* appreciate niceness/kindness.

iu30ut,"Huh. This is a really interesting discussion. As an actor who works primarily in performance capture, let me be the first to credit the animators - the work they do is incredible. And I 100% agree that the finished product is never as simple as taking the actor’s performance and slapping into the cinematic or what have you. 

But all the folks just trashing performance capture... I have to disagree. Anytime I am in the volume, I am working my freakin ass off. And the hope is that it’s a collaborative process. The way Charles Smith mounts his horse, or the way Rhino carries himself to counter his horn are choices that I helped bring to the table. Many times the animation teams are relying on us actors to bring what we can bring, and get excited because that gives them a foundation upon which to layer all of their artistic and technological prowess. 

It’s a symbiotic relationship. And a synergistic one when it’s done right. That’s one of the reasons I love it so much.

EDIT: Hey, thanks for the gold! 😊",2020-09-17 05:43:53

kmf6qa,"My little one (5 y/o) is on the spectrum and has difficulty focusing/being comfortable with music and big sensory things (bright colors, loud noises, too much talking, etc). Music/radio, TV, singing and even talking can lead to stimming and meltdowns. It doesn't help that she's nonverbal and still navigating how to communicate her little person feelings (which are really big!) When she was smaller, around age 2, we never had any issues with over-stimulation ('My Little Pony', 'Moana', were preferred when we watched anything). Cue 3+ and the kid pulled a 180. Things like 'Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood' was too much for her (but 'Mr. Rogers' is fine, by comparison). 

Anyhow, we are always trying to suss out the boundaries on this and picked 'Soul' for our family movie the other night. This movie grabbed her attention instantly and she sat quietly watching every minute. We were so excited that we threw 'Inside Out' on the next day, and got the same result. Something about the pacing, the music, the soft tone of it, and the real-world colors kept her engaged. She even repeated a few names, laughed where appropriate, and genuinely seemed to enjoy the experience.

The pain of loss is much more common and so easy to identify with when the right film hits those familiar chords. 

So if soul didn't hit you hard, I'd assume it's NOT cuz you aren't black, but that you haven't yet hit the crossroads in life where you might have to abandon your life's dream just to make ends meet or cuz of parental expectations, or a surprise baby, etc. 

It's not a bad thing though. If I'm right, then I am happy for you and hope you never have to feel the doubt of whether what you're doing is the right thing or not. 

A lot of us had to put away our dreams to live. And this film made that painful sacrifice come out from deep within our memory.

93ftie,"Those are all good observations. I didn’t make those connections. Man, I’d love to sit down with Brad Bird and hear him explain how this differed enough from the first to follow through on. It almost seems like they didn’t want to make it, but were so tired of all the fan outcry for it that they just threw something quick together, story-wise. Like, “If they liked the first one, fuck it, give it to ‘em again. Change some stuff to distract them though.” I liked Helen/Elastigirl being the action focal point this time, too, but when you realize that it didn’t really add anything to the story (did Bob learning how to parent really matter enough to make a movie-long arc out of for a movie that was wanted for 14 years?), and it’s actually a recycling of Bob’s role in the first one, it really diminishes it.

For those who don’t know this movie was scrapped by Warner bros even though it tested in the 80-90s (out of 100) in private test screenings.

It took a lawsuit for them to take it off the shelf and actually release it instead of just burying it and writing it off as a loss for their tax credits.  The writer and creators of the movie were very upset because they thought they had something special and I believe they do.

The premise of the movie is Coyote is suing ACME because all their inventions literally blow up in his face.  So it’s like a Coyote vs Corporations type of movie, and they said it’s on par with Who Frames Roger Rabbit as far as it’s toon/live action element.",2023-12-20 21:14:30

b2kk8u,"As a huge fan of Vangelis' original Blade Runner score, I have to say that Zimmer's 2049 score was just a bunch of loud noise and really sucked hard. The original was a revolutionary masterpiece, whereas Zimmer's score was a rush job and was just terrible. That was the only thing bad about that otherwise masterful film. Similarly, TOTO's score for DUNE (1984) is also one of my all-time favs, so this news makes be very sad. That said, Zimmer had little time to work on 2049 and had to rush something out, so there's some hope that this time he'll bring his A-game as he usually does on the Nolan films. 🤞",2019-03-18 20:51:09

edit: oooh I'm guessing it's the superbowl NFL game. sorry I'm not from the states I didn't automatically know. I realise it's a big deal for you guys. apologies from the rest of the world for our ignorance ♥",2018-02-05 06:38:53
7vaw74,Awesome! Not a football fan.  What time does superbowl end? 😂,2018-02-05 03:17:18
7vaw74,"There was a ARG for it vut that was likely directed towards more devoted fans which makes this even more win win.

The fans get a big pay off for months of hype and work meanwhile people who barely remember it from all over the world will have instant access to a movie after watching the superbowl.

It's pretty genius 👌",2018-02-05 01:15:03
7vaw74,Netflix loves to try unique ways to promotion and yay it goes viral...sorry to say it's not hype but indeed a well calculated move with lots of money involved...super bowl ads are expensive and if it goes wrong the production has to suffer loses 😁,2018-02-05 08:44:35
