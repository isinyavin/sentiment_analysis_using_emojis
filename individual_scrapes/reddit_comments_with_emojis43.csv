pynqgr,Photoshop is my weapon of choice so I think this is an exciting new feature. I’ve yet to test it thoroughly though but I’ve already come across many scenarios where it doesn’t get it right. It’s still in Beta so I’m sure it will only continue getting better. The more “manual” editing skills I’ve learnt over the years have served me very well and will still do so for years to come. A.I. is coming for all our jobs eventually though so start charging your laser blasters!! 😂😅,2023-04-19 18:16:19

c8rn9f,"It is. I can definitely recommend drinking it without snorting. It was intended to be a Gentleman's Delight, but I wasn't arsed measuring and making it properly, and I had the end of a bottle of sparkling wine sinuses that instead of tonic. Then some tonic because the sparkling wine wasn't very sparkling anymore 😄


Aaaand after a quick poke I've just discovered the Gentleman's Delight was created by Duggan McDonnell and so the recipe isn't online anywhere, only in his book (there is one hit for it on Google, but the instructions fuck it up completely)

If I can recall fr it's 1½ oz bianco vermouth (so sweet white, like Martini Bianco or Cinzano), ¾oz dry gin, 1oz fresh lemon juice, ½ simple syrup, 1oz tonic water. I didn't use the simple syrup because - despite the fact that I'm drinking this at all - I try to keep low carb, and there's plenty bloody carbs and empty alcohol calories in this without adding sugar syrup. I also use low-sugar tonic.

Add all ingredients except tonic to a shaker with ice, shake briefly, then strain into an ice-filled glass while pouring in the measure of tonic with your other hand. Place a thin slice of cucumber on top, and douse that in aromatic bitters. Nom.

Or whack random amounts of the ingredients in a large wine glass, including the bitters, add sparkling wine that's been open 2 days, decide it needs more lifting and splash in some tonic.",2019-07-04 07:11:23

12nn12i,"The thin layer of water that is actually touching the boat (so, like, 1 molecule thick) is not moving relative to the boat. It’s effectively “stuck” to the boat. Same thing happens with air. This creates something called a “boundary layer” where there is effectively a bubble of water moving with the boat that gets progressively weaker and closer to “standstill” the further you get from the boat.

Water is incompressible, so I imagine the front-facing boundary layer is HUGE on a boat this size. The dolphin is chilling inside the boundary layer.

I also imagine that this would be an unstable position to be in (the dolphin would tend to fall to one side or the other, or down under the boat) so it’s keeping itself perpetually centered by using tiny corrections, ergo the spinning.

I try not to anthropomorphize, but I’m fairly certain that dolphins are known to “play” — this lil guy appears to be vibing hard 🥺",2023-04-16 15:26:24

12nn12i,"well technically water is compressible 🤓 

But that aside… the above poster is more or less correct. There is a stagnation region ahead of the bow where the fluid encounters the ship and slows down. If velocity drops pressure increases. 

There’s actually some interesting physics at work in that area, the bulbous bow is pretty ingenious.

(above poster being right largely depends on your definition of wave) But actually I think you guys are both basically saying the same thing.",2023-04-16 01:18:34

The spirals that dolphin is pulling off, while easy in the way of effort, were ridiculously complex maneuvers. The water would move around you faster than you would move from the water pushing you, and the ship would hit you.

ppztfu,"Honestly have no idea but the whole reason I responded to the comment is because a good friend of my wife and I who lives down the street asked me to clean her full sized SUV (GMC Acadia) and her interior looks about like this. Maybe even a little worse? 

I don't even wanna suggest a price to her because we are friends. Like just totally spit balling, I'd probably want anywhere from $150-$200. A full size SUV cleaned like the video posted would probably be about 4 hours of work minimum. Just for the interior. That's not even factoring in if they would want the exterior washed, clayed, polished, waxed/paint sealed.

Edit - I guess I have to edit this comment due to the replies ☺. Please don't take my pricing as gospel. I detail my cars as an enjoyable hobby. I have no idea what rates and pricing are from businesses. I just ballparked what I might charge a neighbor or friend.",2021-09-17 21:09:10

ppztfu,"Here’s what worked for my household: 

Lego sheet. Not allowed to be dumped out unless it’s on the lego sheet. (Or towel) (we also had a playdoh /painting tablecloth-one of the cheap ones from the dollar store)

And a clean dustpan for lego pick up if you didn’t use a sheet you can just lift and dump.

Massive lego fan offspring, never stepped on a lego in my own home.

The most punk thing someone can do is do shit without caring about how it looks to others imo.  These kids that think it's just a look or hold what others in their group think to a high standard are getting it wrong.  It's about don't whatever you want and annoying The Man™ in the process.  Any chucklefuck can get a Misfits shirt and some ripped pants but that's just fashion.  True punk is the philosophy of doing whatever the hell you want.

This is all my opinion of course, but being the only one in the friend group with money bc I work brings some perspective about being punk while still supporting myself/my family u kno",2020-10-13 20:41:05

wu6cfg,"This... it's stuff like this that I think more people should focus on instead of being hateful.
So creative and shows that you took the time to just ""be""... Be in the moment & take in your surroundings. 

A couple weeks ago, I stopped to get some groceries in the middle of the week, and there was this absolutely striking sunset behind the Safeway I was going to. It was beautiful, I stood in the packed parking lot (no cars coming) and just admired the shape of the clouds and how the brightly colored rays from the sun just sliced through the sky. It was such a vibrant sunset!

I looked around and everyone was just monotonous... Going about their day, grabbing dinner or groceries, talking on their phones, looking down at the ground... Everything was busy busy and all bustle. It was interesting to see something so serene and pretty and not one person took notice of how cool it looked.

Before going into the store, I noticed the big cloud looked exactly like a King Kong outline! I pointed it out to my partner who paused to also appreciate the clouds and sky at that time- he even pointed out a couple more shapes in the clouds. I got my phone and took a couple pictures- and then my partner tapped me on the arm and pointed to a couple random sets of people a ross the parking lot.

They had saw me looking up, appreciating the sunset, they started to appreciate it as well. There were like 4 other sets of people in the parking lot who were now taking the time to pause and just appreciate to ""be""...

We chuckled and went inside to get our things. My partner then said that I did my good deed for the day and I was like ""what! How? By looking at the sunset?"" And he said ""well yeah, you grounded those people. You reminded them to take life in, to pause and appreciate something beautiful!"" 

... I know- as cheesy as that sounds its so true. 
So to that- I say thank you for this really neat video! It will remind me to pause more often 😁",2022-08-22 00:11:34

I'm in Florida and I love the Heat but I'm so over the State of Florida LOL for many reasons. I would like some change, and I had an opportunity to move, but in the Montreal area. I know Canada is a huge country and I actually know very little about it,  but I had a best friend from Montreal, as well as a friend from the west side of Canada I can't remember what it was called maybe British Columbia?but he was such a gentleman and I remember he said he grew up with men who preferred bigger size women and I asked him,, why to keep you warmer? Lol he said I guess so but they just thought it was more attractive...he got recruited to play for the Atlanta Braves and we met through a pilates class bc they trained in fl .This is beautiful thank you so much for sharing it reminds me a little bit of Northern California when I lived there also one of the most beautiful places on Earth because there, you can look to the left, and there's snow capped mountains.

dxrx7w,Love the show! So sad it ended quickly tho ❤️,2019-11-18 01:29:57
dxrx7w,"**The cutting tool**.    
Guys- it's just a rotary cutter! Based on the color I'd guess it's a 60mm Olfa rotary cutter. You can probably find it at some Walmarts, definitely Joanns, Amazon, etc. They are often used in conjunction with a cutting mat in quilting to cut fabric precisely. Some garment sewers also use these to cut out pattern pieces. That just feels to dangerous to me so I just use scissors.      
I only own the more common 45mm size and it is too small to use on pizza so I cannot speak to its effectiveness in that context.      
I hope I've helped some of you on your next drunk Amazon order! 😂",2019-11-18 03:38:21

When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong,
Give a pussy whistle!
Give a pussy whistle!
When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong,
Give a pussy whistle!
Give a pussy whistle!
Not just a little squeak,
Pucker up and blow.
And if your whistle's weak, yell ""Jiminy Cricket!""
Take the straight and narrow path
And if you start to slide,
Give a pussy whistle!
Give a pussy whistle!

vi6f0j,I tried tomatoes so many times and every time it absolutely destroys my seasoning. I just made it a rule not to use because ain’t nobody have time to do several hours of reseasoning after a tomato dish. It’s like an etching agent. Takes all the shiny away and leaves a matte finish that everything sticks to. I don’t think it’s my fault. My seasoning works really well otherwise. I can go a year with perfectly nonstick finish and once I do 1 tomato dish it’s ruined ☹️,2022-06-23 02:08:51

1366ghn,"The OG Dragonball when Goku is a kid is actually a really nice anime. It doesn't have the over the top transformation/action stuff that something like DBZ has. It's more of an adventure story with some action elements. But unlike DBZ, the action in Dragonball is a bit more grounded and is more like martial arts rather than flying around and attacking so fast you break the sound barrier. The tournament arc in Dragonball is so much more enjoyable to me than the later DBZ ones because of this.

Also Dragonball actually has a pretty good dub, something I can't say about DBZ...

Both opening songs slap hard though, [here](https://youtu.be/FJqGirLjQn4) is Dragonball's, and [here](https://youtu.be/pYnLO7MVKno) is DBZ's (I linked the full version because this one slaps the hardest).

I love both anime, but the OG Dragonball is better in my eyes. This is because I dislike how later in DBZ, every problem gets fixed by wishing it away, there aren't any consequences, and character deaths don't mean anything. Also how transformations got really lame after the second one, and basically became a convenient way for the heroes to beat a harder enemy, just transform better. It got a bit ridiculous and was carried over into Dragonball Super whole-heartedly.

But ya, OG Dragonball, you should give it a shot. 👍°-°👍",2023-05-03 06:26:02

Also, breathing in all that silica dust will cause irreparable damage to lungs.  Tiny cuts inside your lungs creating scar tissue and massively reducing lung capacity and efficiency.  Not just the person cutting, but anyone else downwind who happens to breathe air on occasion will breathe that in.

xyvkie,"I’m not sure if it will help for everyone but if rejection sensitivity can be subdued long enough for your mind to go from the “red” zone to the “yellow” zone, you will be able to reason yourself out of those feelings. (please know that I have been in CBT therapy for years and I’ve been fascinated by the brain for decades. I’m also medicated for my ADHD and BPD) 

For me, the sand puts enough of a strange, cool, sensation on my hands that I am able to pull myself out of the irrational red zone and into a more level way of thinking. It doesn’t have to be sand either! You can make a homemade lava lamp with an old soda bottle and glitter so you can stare at that if you are a more visual person. Or maybe you can put together a specific type of playlist if you are an auditory person :) I’m a tactile person!! So the sand works SUPER well for me. Sometimes I put 2 small clumps of it in the fridge and press it to my temples. The cold sensation plus the sandy text-ire is enough to shock me back into my rational self ❤️ there is a YouTube channel called [HowToADHD](https://youtube.com/c/HowtoADHD) that was monumental in understanding my mental health",2022-10-09 14:47:21

vy26yh,"Greens on golf courses really depends on the course. I worked on a golf course for a few summers during university. Our club had 2 courses across the highway from eachother with an underpass between them 18 hole championship course where if you werent a member it was quite pricy to golf at, hosted lots of tournament and across the street the 9 hole heritage course. 


Both got virtually the same mowing regimine, both had their pins  changed every morning, and had a lot the same basic maitence. Champion course got extras on top though. One summer I was in charge of the greens. Heritage course once per afternoon i would check the moisture levels on each green, Champion course 3 times per afternoon and soil ph once per day. Heritage course was weeded by staff(occasionally golfers would do whats happening in video) once a week or so and got replacement plugs(if area of grass was too weedy you would take the section out and replace with perfect section from our nursery; kind of like putting down sod for a new lawn but more precise). Champions course I would check for weeds daily and replace any damage or extra weedy sections every everning with the head grounds keeper checking every saturday. Tee boxes were close to the same but everything just slightly less. I feel like I make it sound like there was more weeds than there was rereading it. They would all be checked for weeds, it wasnt often weeds were found. 

On the fairway weeds were less managed but still managed, everything was mowed daily so nothiny got big. It was everyones job to keep an eye out and every staff golf cart had tools for removing them and knew how to replace sections of sod from the nursery and how to make sure it stayed level and to check to make sure you werent near automatic sprinklers. 


Working at a golf course you are basically a grass farmer 😜. It was both a really fun job then when thought about on a wider scale really depressing because if we used the perfectly manacured grassland time, space, fertilizers, and water we could have been feeding a lot of people.",2022-07-13 18:03:29

12jw2vl,"I am an electrician who specializes in custom homes. One of my absolutely favorite spots in those high-end homes is the master bathroom.

I was at this one custom remodel some time back that had a sliding glass door to enter the master bathroom. Once opened it revealed a very tall ceiling (25 feet tall), with a kind of a reversed L-shaped floor plan, with a walk in closet with its own door filling the L to make a rectangle. The shower was forwards and to the right, the bathtub directly right. The bath tub wasn't anything crazy, but man that shower was special.

It was a walk-in shower, meaning there were no doors or walls seperating the shower from the rest of the bathroom, hidden drains on a very slightly-slanted marble floor, with a shower head the size of a car wheel (a big one at that too) about 10 feet or so up on the wall, and to top it all off, the ceiling above it (again, 25 foot ceiling) was a skylight. I would pay to shower in that thing 😂

I feel like this is a cleaner (and cheaper) way of doing a shower skylight though, closer to the ground, and in a cylindrical-shaped shower. I'd love to have something like this eventually, I'd love to hear our Oregon rain as I'm showering 💜",2023-04-13 01:53:55

These lyrics are from Only Happy When it Rains by Garbage in case anyone else wants to know.

The only changed word is ""shower"" but I wasn't sure if more was changed or not.

hrwvxt,"""Retractable Pilot Precise"" is an excellent pen choice! I am in my early 30s going back to school to finish my engineering degree and I must say that is my favorite pen! I prefer it in the v5 (5mm), especially for calculus but the v7 (7mm) is usable. I never had a favorite pen when I went to college in my 20's and got my Associate's but I guess I'm choosier now than I was then and can actually afford to be.

I am impressed you were able to keep up with them all. That is very methodical! Congrats on your Master's!  👏👨‍🎓",2020-07-16 03:31:51

cbnzl8,"Hey so I've been through several of the same phase. I notice you have a fan. Invest 180-250 dollars on an AC. It will do wonders for depression. Nothing sucks shit more than working too hard at a job that doesn't pay enough , dragging yourself through the darkness that is you life, getting back to your HOME and not being comfortable.

It's not like having a tv vs having books, it's not like playing sports vs video games, it's not a discussion. It's a fact. You WILL feel better, sleep better, look more forward to being in your own home and your dogs will love it!!!

Also, I'm not hitting on you nor do I expect or require a response but I feel like I've been in a similar boat....you're a very attractive young lady, you have your own place and two sweet dogs (so patient around the vacuum!) And your life will come around as soon as you take charge of it :) I got out of a 7 year relationship about 2 years ago and did more in the last two than I'd done in the previous ten. I'm in a management role in the field I plan on working in until retirement and sometimes I still don't believe this is me now.

Even with having it together, I freaking hate cleaning and use the wash & fold next door to evade the shame of loathing laundry as well 🙃

Best of luck to you and I'm always available to PM if you need anyone to talk to!",2019-07-11 02:01:53

fpzu4m,I am an area manager for amazon and i would be proud to have a wall builder like that on my team. I run the AFE (packing) department and sometimes go to dock to help them when associates are on break. That wall looks 10 times better then the walls i build lol. 👍,2020-03-28 00:18:55
fpzu4m,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to say thanks for all the comments and awards and I wanted to answer a couple questions I’ve been seeing. 

•I asked my mom and she said the semi trucks need to be loaded like that (or as close as you can) with the smiles all facing toward you. They’ll then go to another city or town and be unloaded and sorted onto the actual delivery trucks. I think they want it like that to use as much space as possible, and to get as many packages in there as they can. 

•The phone rule has been lifted due to the virus, and they’ve been so stressed and busy lately with all the orders coming through, she just needed to admire her work for 1 second. She won’t be taking any more pictures! 

•I promise, this isn’t an ad, just something I thought was cool and wanted share my moms badassery with you! And I apologize for the crop, or lack thereof. I didn’t really think about it, it was a spur of the moment post. 

She also thanks all the kind words, it’s nice to hear so many people be so kind for what seems like a thankless job. She does her best, and in my opinion she’s probably one of the best at it! Thanks a lot everyone, stay safe out there!✌️",2020-03-28 02:21:49

fpzu4m,"Beautiful!
I worked as a seasonal package handler at Fedex and i had several people walk by my trailers and walk back and ask who was loading, cause it looked so good.  Really made me proud. 😊
I would go back and forth between 2 or 3 trailers  loading.  I was fast too. Unfortunately, the young  guy in charge very rarely allowed me to go to the heaviest/fastest loading trailers in the end as he always let his two buddies work those trailers....so I rarely got the chance to really challenge myself. Those trailers got SLAMMED continually!
But I DID take pride in my work as I loaded my 2-3 mid volume trailers.

It was really fun...and a great workout.",2020-03-27 20:12:24

Amazon's work culture is tough to get used to but being in leadership and making real change with new ventures within the company is worth it. There are flaws, obviously, and there can be improvements, but as a whole it's ok. I'm not saying it's perfect and it's also different within each facility. 

I think that people in fulfilment centers forget that it's warehousing. It's going to be physically tough. Not every person will be able to physically handle the job. I would love to be paid more though 🤷🏻‍♀️ I work way too hard (physically and mentally) for the measly $16.50. It's very stressful especially during peak and prime week.",2020-03-27 21:23:00

In the literal thousands of oysters sorted I’ve, at this point, seen four pearls.  That said, we don’t shuck many just to see if they have pearls.  Especially when the boss is around.  Oysters=money",2022-12-28 05:53:22

Wrap just falls off. I spend a small fortune on these every year during their season.

Their taste isn’t as great as a regular mandarin imo, but the size and ease of peel makes them the clear winner, and the taste isn’t bad at all, just doesn’t have as much bitterness as a smaller variant. Definitely sweeter.

Got questions -

1) Is the fellow chopping off nails in the earlier part of the video?

2) How come the horse is confident/calm enough to let the man bend the limbs and do whatever the human deems fit?

3) The horse shoe... Doesn't that thing gets NAILED to the horse's foot? Isn't that hurtful? 🤔

We have these marvelous little things in higher altitude aircraft incase of an emergency depressurization. Our one and only priority if/when we dump cabin pressure is to get this thing over our face so we dont pass out. A good rabbit hole of amazement is to look up “time of useful consciousness” for the 40,000 feet level. 😬",2022-11-23 15:54:17
z2gz3d,"Nah, its stored in a easy to access little container thats way over engineered as you would want it to be in a situation where if you fuck around too much everyone dies. You basically yank on the red grippy parts, squeezing them and it helps yeet it out of the hole. You yolo off your hat/headset/sunglasses/hopes and dreams and get the inflated cage over your head and let go. As long as the mask is over your nose and mouth its gona make you breathe. Should be a 4-5 second thing for a pilot. The biggest delay should be the “oh shit oh fuck oh shit oh fuck what happened, are we depressurized? Oh shit oh fuck what do we do?!? MASKS!!!” Then the real fun starts, making sure the other pilot got theirs on while diving down to a breathable altitude, remembering to flip the switch to use the microphone in the mask so you can communicate to the other pilot and ATC and oh remember… theres a hole in the jet somewhere that needs to be considered! 😂",2022-11-23 16:14:28

Yeah, my big baby had been horrifically abused before he came to me, so I say it like ""haha funny dumb animal"" but I have my suspicions that he probably had it beat out of him. Like when I got him, his hair was gone from where he had a poor fitting girth, he had marks all over his side from really harsh spurs, and according to my coach who rescued him, he was found in a tiny stall, with poop piled high...just awful.

10uf12p,"Thank you. Tired of all of these people on Reddit who label everything abuse or act like this look is the norm.

This breed has been around for over a thousand years and the first written descriptions of them describe them almost exactly as they look today.

The loose skin around their face and neck and their huge ears help them detect scents. And since they were used to hunt boars and the like, the skin also protects their face and neck from fatal penetrating injuries.

Every damn thing on Reddit is deemed abusive and it’s annoying. Excessive forehead skin is a fault when it comes to breeding bloodhounds and they are actually bred to keep excessive skin OUT of bloodlines, but let the know-it-all armchair vets on Reddit tell it they are bred for excessive skin. 🙄",2023-02-05 19:57:27

hnrnym,"Here’s a detailed little explanation that’ll answer pretty much all your questions: (source: this is a fairly popular craft among young people in Asia especially China and Japan and I grew up in China and had a best friend who 100% mastered this)

This 橡皮章 (quite literally means rubber stamp), the material used in this is rubber not lino, although it’s the same concept, this rubber is much more sturdier than lino and has a much smoother surface. **Here’s them on Etsy and generally they come in these appearances:**
[solid colors](http://etsy.me/1fSuig7)
[sandwich style (white sandwiched with color on ends)](http://etsy.me/122Wt8m)
[sandwich style but peelable (lazy way out)](https://etsy.me/3gHvDdC)
[semi clear with a matte look](https://etsy.me/38Fj6Er)
[clear](https://etsy.me/31VPhhL)

**How is the pattern transferred onto the block then?** Well there are many ways to do this and most often people use nail polish or moisturizers. And what transfer method all depends on what kind of rubber block you’re carving on, what printer you’re using... it’s tricky 🤷‍♀️ you might need to get on asian forums to get a really detailed guide. OR, go in with the good ol trace and press transfer, that’ll work 100% of the time but it’ll take you forever. And remember everything is backwards!!

**What are those triangle things and what do they do?** haha they’re purely for aesthetics. The purpose of the white area is to make sure the Patrick star gets a nice and elevated surface, kind of like this: (______———______) So they don’t have to be triangles, you can even leave it plain flat with no pattern, although there are tutorials on how to carve beautiful background patterns like stripes, roses etc.

Here’s some of my own work if you’re curious! The first two are on lino, so you can see very clearly why it’s not ideal: you want a smoother and sturdier material to make the print better and also more aesthetically pleasing.

But all I can think about, being from a part of the Midwest that needs to take these things into consideration, is the extra weight on that roof, and whether it’ll be able to sustain itself? Not to mention the extraordinary weight on the shed next to it?! Do they have a plan to clear that all off? What is their back-up if everything falls through? Do they have extra blankets and fuel in their vehicle?? What about snow tires?! Enough blankets in the trunk in case they get stuck in the snow and can’t get rescued fast enough?? Rations and coats and a snow shovel and flares??????

Edit: I amend my statement, sharp knives have the potential to cut deeper with less force, but you won’t have as much force behind a sharp knife because you don’t need as much force to cut with them. And, the resulting wound will be cleaner and smoother, and will heal cleaner with less scarring as a result.",2020-04-27 03:03:39

g8s55o,"You’re right, a sharp knife can just go deeper easier than a dull one will, equal force behind both. But usually you’ve got more force behind it because you’re compensating for the shitty blade.

iwrd0u,"The juxtaposition of a viscerally colorful or violent image such as the one evoked by your username (conjuring up the idea of throwing a fetus as hard as you can) with the concept of sensitively taking the time to say a kind word, is a very jarring and funny one. Its like stabbing someone and then helping an old lady cross the street. Often, on Reddit, there is a running gag of users calling attention to the grotesque username of someone leaving a sweet or otherwise juxtaposable comment. This is what I was doing. Like if someone named u/SharpieInPooper or u/SloppySalivaBlowjob or u/EvisceratedOrphanCorpse, for example, said something inocuous heartwarming or innocent in a comment. I wasn't actually thanking you. I was calling attention to your username so that future scrollers can see the juxtaposition of your words and your evocative username and laugh at it. 🙃

Point is... When I came home after burying him on my dad's property, I was glad there was fur all over the yard. I gathered some up to sprinkle like ashes in his favorite places and left the rest for birds and squirrels. 


For those wondering, if anyone is... He had a mass on his spleen that we discovered three days before he passed. It must have ruptured because his gums turned white and his mouth and paws were cold indicating massive blood loss. He was a brave pup and didn't seem to suffer at all. He hung in there as long as he could... Best dog I've ever known and set the bar exceptionally high for all future dogs.

yaykhc,"For those wondering…

This looks to be at soldier field Chicago (bears logo) so it’s not setup for concerts (ie designated main stage) so that’s likely the reason for having to run all the wiring like this (through hallways and doors)

I don’t have a source for this concert, but I worked in sports for a few years and this is definitely not normal in arenas lol (before people thing every arena show
Is like this with cables in hallway and through doors)

Very cool and amazing job the crew 👍🏻 I’m sure it was alot of work doing the whole show there",2022-10-23 14:59:32

The basement also had its own vault, full-bar, home theater, and showroom big enough for multiple luxury vehicles to show off to your friends while you all smoked Cubans. 

Very nice people. They also tipped well.",2019-07-12 18:28:04

rp5qqv,"That guy gave good info but also made my eyes roll into the back of my head. He talks like ✨*art*✨ is the reason for *every* decision animators make, when it can be practicality or other constraints. And I don't think (most) people are trying to ""fix"" cartoons with interpolation, it's generally more of a curiosity.

Nothing wrong with checking out or even enjoying interpolated stuff, just like it's fine to watch dubbed anime or mod video games even if the artist ""didn't intend"" for it to be experienced that way. 

Again, his points are legit but he oversells it almost to a comical degree. Which may be his thing, to be fair; I haven't seen any of his other videos",2021-12-27 01:27:24
rp5qqv,"100% agree. I work with 3d modeling and sometimes animation, I can't claim to know anything about hand drawn animation but my experience with animation in general is much less magical than he makes it seem to be. What I dislike about the video is, professional animators are adults and can handle someone editing or disliking their work 😅",2021-12-27 01:32:23

f4imxk,That has got to be the shittiest way to patch a wall. First he uses a Staley knife for the wall and then thinks he can just slab a piece of plaster board there and is done 🤣👌  I want to see him put something there like a power outlet or even press his fingers there cause it’s not going to last especially if you have kids running into walls. All he needed is something on the back in the corners of the hole so the board won’t get knocked back into the wall.,2020-02-16 12:55:39

To answer the question, I started playing about 4 years ago. Self-taught, never a music lesson in my life. I just pick it up and let my fingers dance lol 
It is a very emotive instrument I have found. Helps me relax and others too lol I'll pick out songs by ear that I play as w3ll as improv stuff like this video 😀",2023-05-14 13:06:04

13gw7dr,Yeah there are so many options!  I know a great resource is www.jonnylipfordmusic.com  I know him personally and he has great starter flutes on his site for less than 200$ the particular flute in this video was made for me by Gene Eugene Ewing out in Oregon.  That drone flute was 200$ if you look him up on Facebook messenger you should be able to get ahold of him if you want a similar flute 😀,2023-05-14 12:52:47
13gw7dr,I'll look into that! Mostly after work I don't have my mic with🤣 do  you notice a difference in quality with wireless mics?,2023-05-14 12:55:01
13gw7dr,"Well my first one was a double flute🤣 but honestly a single flute in the key of A G or F would probably be the best way to start. Those are common keys so you could play with other instruments easily and the fingering spacing for the holes in those keys are closer together so you don't have to stretch to reach right off the bat. 

Then just play! Don't worry about sounding good or getting a song down right away, let your fingers dance! Feel the music in your soul and breath into the flute 😀 you will be surprised at how emotive it can be.",2023-05-14 13:35:18
13gw7dr,This one was 200$ He makes them all by hand in his garage 😀,2023-05-14 13:29:09

Or I could put it in front of a prominent window so it's visible from the street 😁

Might attract thieves though!  That would be willing to risk jail time to get their hands on (*checks PrusaSlicer...*) $1.91 worth of plastic.",2023-02-22 15:42:15
118np5q,Donate it to a good cause 👍,2023-02-22 15:34:23

118np5q,"FYI: I'm the ""people"" that made this vase.  I didn't just print it I designed it  👍

Since you replied to the Original Poster (me) I thought I'd let you in on the secret 😁",2023-02-22 14:40:40
118np5q,"Get one!  It's a super fun hobby and *so useful*!

Just know that it's a *hobby*, not a toaster.  You don't just plug it in and tell it what to print.  There's going to be learning curve and *endless* tweaking (because you can always make it print better with very minor changes; sometimes just software settings).  There will also be the occasional print failures and issues (it's a lot of moving parts) to troubleshoot.

Then there's filament: You'll never have enough! haha

None of it is rocket science though.  If you're capable of screwing/unscrewing screws and aren't afraid to *just try new things* (even when everything's working perfectly) you have the necessary skills 👍",2023-02-22 15:19:03

118np5q,"Hey now... It's my 3D design (I created that vase model).  When you 3D print your own vase design you're showing off your own vase!

So the title is accurate and not redundant 😛",2023-02-22 17:08:31
118np5q,"Last time I posted a vase like this to that sub they removed it saying, ""not blackmagicfuckery"" 🤷",2023-02-22 17:00:08
118np5q,"No, I came up with the design while fooling around with OpenSCAD.  It was my very first OpenSCAD model 👍",2023-02-22 16:48:12
118np5q,"That's how it looked right off the printer.  I literally ripped it off the bed (made a cool, ""thonk!"" sound) and took the video 👍",2023-02-22 15:39:14
118np5q,"Just buy a kit.  Saves money *and* you end up learning the ins and outs of how the printer is put together so if anything ever breaks you'll immediately know how to fix it.

Which one to get?  I dunno, depends on your budget.  Go look at the stickied post at /r/3Dprinting and they'll help you out 👍",2023-02-22 15:24:29
118np5q,"No, you probably saw this one: https://gfycat.com/edibleartistichornbill

Which was the vase that broke last weekend when I was doing a 3D printing demonstration for a local robotics team 🤷",2023-02-22 15:21:17
118np5q,"What the hell does that have to do with anything?  LOL!

For reference, anyone with a 3D printer can print all the Legos they want.  Yes, it's true!  Takes a little bit of tweaking but after that they turn out great.

I actually add Lego pegs and correctly-sized Technic holes to all sorts of models that I make so people can attach minifigures or Technic stuff (e.g. gears) to them.  I made a bunch of fridge magnets and magnetic pins/badges for my son's robotics team a while back. They were a huge hit.  Some of the best team swag at all the events 👍",2023-02-22 14:50:09

I wouldn't say it's more ""vibrant"". You probably just have a very strongly positive memory of it 👍",2023-02-22 18:53:07

118np5q,Yep: I designed that vase 👍,2023-02-22 17:21:22
118np5q,"I know, right?  I keep meaning to try putting one on the front of the car to see how it holds up over time before committing to printing a ton of a similar-looking material to cover up the rest 😁

The sun usually destroys 3D printed stuff but *not if you coat it with some UV protectant spray*.  I had a coated print out in the Florida sun for over a year and it still looked OK.  Got coated with a lot of calcium though because it was being hit by the irrigation system though so it didn't ""stay pretty"" 🤷",2023-02-22 17:21:03
118np5q,No but...  *How much would you pay for a vase like this?*  Asking for a friend 😁,2023-02-22 15:38:25
118np5q,"No, the model is a solid object *so you can choose how thick/tall you want it to be in your slicer*.  If the model was just a hollow vase then if you scaled it up the walls would become thicker (unnecessarily so) or if you scaled it down they'd become too thin.  By making the model a solid object the end user can print it using whatever wall thickness they like (or use ""vase mode"") 👍",2023-02-22 16:52:22
118np5q,"> Is it functional?

Yesssss...  It appears to be mesmerizing *hundreds of thousands* today!  Soon it will be in their dreams!  MWUAHAHAHA!!!

As a side benefit it also has a hole in the top in which flowers *can* be inserted 👍",2023-02-22 14:54:09

best way to calm dogs is to let them see you, and feel your hands, make it as stress free as possible.

It's easier just to wash our hands after, it's not uncommon we get poop on us, regardless of matting 🙂

Edit: disposable gloves are also terrible for the enviroment.",2022-12-08 11:50:48

My date was stunned. I filled it in under 30 mins. I found a Target bag on the beach and filled that one, too. I still don’t think she believes that I did one in 2019 with about 75 other people and we filled a construction dumpster in TWO HOURS.

117so0d,"I learned about Almere, and saw it from tall buildings in Amsterdam, but I didn’t get a chance to visit. I assumed it was a suburb of Amsterdam, where people live so they can commute to the big city for work. But you make it sound much more separate than that. Is it totally its own thing, or is it kind of a suburb of Amsterdam?

My family ties are in Delft, Schoonhoven, and Gouda. I also really liked Schiedam (that library!), Oudewater (I’m not a witch!), Broek in Waterland, and of course Rotterdam and Utrecht. I just love your country, and I felt so at home there! Maybe it’s because I grew up with the accent and the culture, or maybe it’s just that it’s really special and easy to love. It could also be that it’s cloudy and rainy most days in my hometown…

Thank you so much, my elderly Dutch youngster vriend! You are continuing to prove to me that the Dutch are the best. I really appreciate your help! I have to focus on getting through nursing school right now, but the things you shared with me will be invaluable when I graduate and try to move for real.

As for the language- I think understanding/speaking the local tongue is an essential part of belonging in a place. Thankfully, learning languages is one of my strengths! I can speak a tiny bit of Dutch so far, but learning is slow when there’s no one to practice with (my mom started school in the US, so she only learned language skills in English). But I am doing my best to learn and practice! The first full sentence I could say was “de kat zit op de tafel” 😂
Just curious- do people expect to speak Dutch when they go to the hospital, or is it normal to speak English there too?",2023-02-22 01:40:43

b88a53,"Craft enthusiast here!! It’s actually incredibly easy nowadays. You need: a printer, a laminator and reactive foil. The most famous brand nowadays is MINC foil. This foil reacts with the heat of the laminator to plastics. Since toner is 55% plastic, it adheres to it. So, you print your design remembering everything black will be the foiled part. You put your foil over your design an pass it through the laminator. Next, the satisfaction of peeling the foil to reveal your awesome foiled design. Voila!

They give their honey more volume so they can outcompete the honey producers abroad with cheaper honey and there’s Chinese garlic. Their prepeeled garlic has a high chance that prison labor was used to peel the cloves.

It’s unfortunate that the big blue W—-art has no such scruples. A decent-sized local apiary got a call from a W buyer wanting to buy their honey. He started to talk to them about their rigorous standards and processes and how it was all strictly local and they just cut him off and said they didn’t want to know anything about it or where it came from (even another country where it could be adulterated or tainted)- they just wanted to buy from a US company so they could slap that on the label.

I've seen green techs/engineers walk out of events on numerous occasions because they can't handle the pressure when something goes wrong.

Everything's going smooth, then suddenly one crucial thing fucks up, and you've got thousands of angry (usually drunk) people screaming directly at you along with the talent (also usually drunk/high) screaming through a microphone to said crowd of drunks that it's your fault their evening is ruined. That's when I've seen people walk out. But when you fix that problem and see everything settle back into normalcy, it's such a fucking adrenaline rush knowing that you're the one line between the best night ever or a mob of screaming drunkards destroying the venue and possibly you.

114lwbj,"That’s probably what the exhibit said, I was just like 🤯😱🤔. I remember in 6th grade, we had to do a report on an animal, and there was a list to choose from. I missed school on the regular (severe anxiety since I was a wee thing), and when I went back, the only choices left were hyena and some big lizard (water monitor?). I thought hyenas were cute wild dogs, so I picked them. 

Of course, these were the days where your choice of informational sources were the frustratingly difficult (for 10 year old me) card catalog at the library, OR the incomplete Encyclopedia Brittanica that one’s parents got tired of buying every other week at the grocery store, so the knowledge only went up to “Sa-Sp” and if I’d chosen “Water Monitor” I’d have been SOL.",2023-02-19 16:56:40

155jtj4,"Hey, fellow Redditors! Gather 'round for the legendary tale of my utterly lazy and apathetic pet sloth, Donald!  
  
So, I adopted Donald a few months ago because, you know, life needed a little extra... slothiness! And boy, oh boy, he's the epitome of ""slow and steady wins the race"" – well, the race to nap city, at least.  
  
You see, every morning, I wake up full of energy, ready to take on the day like a champ! Meanwhile, Donald, my pet sloth, is still in dreamland, snoring away like he's auditioning for a woodland orchestra. I'm telling you; the sound is epic, like a symphony of saws and wheezing! 😴  
  
Breakfast time is another level of entertainment. As I prepare his sloth-approved gourmet salad (yeah, we take this seriously), Donald just stares at me with those beady eyes, as if to say, ""Hurry up, mate, I've got all day."" The suspense is electrifying!  
  
Now, don't even get me started on walks – well, ""walks"" is an overstatement. It's more like a sloth crawl that makes snails look like Olympic sprinters. We could literally get stuck behind a tortoise, and Donald wouldn't bat an eyelid.  
  
Sometimes, when I'm feeling particularly adventurous, I try to teach him tricks, like ""High Five!"" And let me tell you, the excitement is contagious... not! Donald couldn't care less; it's like trying to motivate a sloth to run a marathon. It's just not happening.  
  
But, you know what? Despite his snail-like pace and indifference to life's speedy shenanigans, I wouldn't trade Donald for anything in the world. There's something oddly calming about having a sloth buddy by your side. It's like he's the master of zen, and I'm just an overcaffeinated apprentice trying to keep up!  
  
So, here's to Donald, the one and only slow-motion sensation who's taught me the art of chilling like a pro. Cheers to sloths, the living embodiment of ""Why hurry when you can snooze?"" 🐢🤙

The only option would be a mountain, but then that's already a free scratcher. However, given enough cows, I'm sure they could eventually move mountains. 😉",2023-04-29 19:26:55

wm74gx,"No disrespect, but I watched this to treat it as a how to and got confused. When they place the green sludge atop the five fibers, there's no context on what the green stuff is.


I imagine it's full of oils and proteins based on the way it oozes, but they completely switch vessels after that so it's not clear what they are moving. I'm feeling u/restofthefuckingowl vibes 


Can someone PLEASE just make an easy how-to guide on how to make paper in a less advanced society? 


Truck-san booked me for Tuesday 🥺

Edit: Nevermind, I see now that the green slur is likely acting as a glue-like agent. It was not placed on the shredded fibers at first. It gets washed in. The step we see with it oozing is just extracting the glue agent from the plant.

What did I miss though? What is the green plant?",2022-08-12 08:01:05

Back to the real world though, I don't wanna know what this paper costs. It's super cool people keep the tradition alive, but I'm sure you couldn't mass produce those same danmei novels in million of copies a print run so I can buy them for 20 euros a volume... so I'm still happy for modern tech XD",2022-08-12 09:47:18

121oigk,"These phones have a very high bond adhesive between the display and enclosure, and this keeps the water out. But like anything it will degrade over time, especially if it has come in contact with liquid.

The deeper you go, the higher the pressure, the more that water wants to breach that adhesive seal. Just in case this helps anyone 😀",2023-03-26 00:04:16

We haven’t really needed to engage in fake-organic marketing; we’ve got such a lovely community of artists who love to share. They’re so wholesome - the office gets a kick out of seeing every new piece of art. Best part of my job! 💖",2019-07-20 23:51:25

cfpb7v,"We’re always watching! 👍 In terms of latency, positional accuracy, tilt, azimuth and stroke look-ahead prediction, Apple Pencil is currently the technology to beat.

iPadOS has the latency down to 9ms, too, which is a lovely bonus. That’s only slightly longer than a single frame draw-time at 120Hz, which means we can paint on the very next frame (plus some swings and roundabouts).

Wacom don’t offer a Cintiq at anything above 60Hz, and I don’t believe the Tab is 120 either. That makes a heckuva difference to natural-feeling art.",2019-07-21 11:06:38

But since you are talking about Mozzarella - this is the rule of thumb I was talking about. It's an aged cheese, but afaik it doesn't age very long and it's also very soft. It has lactose, even though it's not as much as in like cream cheese. So that's probably where your problem with it came from.

Of course, you're right, it's also about sensitivity. I think I can eat some Mozzarella without having lactase beforehand, whereas other lactose intolerant people can't.",2022-12-04 17:15:44

I have a s21 ultra, and it is pretty wild how good the footage looks from a thin phone camera. 

However if you are watching it critically, on a large monitor the go pro footage has a much higher ceiling IMO. The dynamic range is much better, and there is less noise on the go pro. 

Still shots of course are orders of magnitude better off of the Samsung. 

10 years ago, I wouldnt have thought that you could get this type of footage on either an action cam, or cellphone.

So it’s oddly poignant for me to see this: The world 🌍 continues to turn even after very tough events. And I’m glad to see I can be happy for someone else who achieved something I lost — that I felt was worth doing. Others may scorn this kind of collection, and/or think “What is the big deal?” But for me, at the poverty level, this was a chance to leave something behind for my descendants, that might have value in the next millennium, if they were good custodians of it. I thought, if it benefited my future progeny, they might think kindly of me. I don’t know why others collect things, that was my reason for this. But I haven’t tried to collect anything since. My daughter brings me back a Christmas ornament when she has the opportunity to go somewhere I think is neat. So I guess that’s it.",2021-07-18 22:19:32

ex1o7c,That’s exactly who I heard in my head ❤️,2020-02-01 13:27:41
ex1o7c,"my dad taught my brother and I how to skate when we were 3 & 4 years old on the community skating rink. The next couple winters he would turn out front yard into a giant icerink. We lived in the city, on a street with over 15 kids. So many times we would come home and the neighbors were skating on our rink. My dad ended up making an icerink on our lawn AND the neighbors lawn (who had an even bigger lawn than ours!) He also climbed up a giant ass tree  we had in our front yard by himself. My mom, brother & I were walking back from getting icecream when I seen him all the way up in the tree from down the street. He was setting up a tire swing for us. He also built a shed beside our house and would shovel all the snow from the iceink into a giant hill that would reach the top of the shed. He’d water it sometimes so it would get icey and we’d take the tireswing up to the top of the hill on the shed and go down on our skates holding on to the tire. That one was a deathwish waiting to happen lol. 

Thank you for reminding me how much my dad loves us and use to try and bring us the world to make us happy. Alot of things have changed as time has gone on - i’m more of a parent to him than he is to me, but man he use to do anything and everything to make us happy & i’ll forever appreciate that. Some of my best and favorite memories.

Story time!!! 

Grew up in a rural-ish area. The road to our house was grave (still is) off a state highway. Neighborhood surrounded by farm fields. 3.5 acre lots. At the western edge of our property there was a white fence and then a horse boarding farm with all the barns, riding areas, etc. one would expect. On the north border, a pond, swamp, and the start of my Uncle’s 3.5 acre lot. 

Brother and I were in digging though the stash of firecrackers and bottle rockets on one of the many days we were left at home to our own devices and found a M80. Being reasonably smart we set it aside for when Dad got home and resumed our firecracker mischief. 

Dad got home and… I guess decided he should reward his sons for being smart and not lighting off a M80. He grabbed a small log from the wood pile (house had a monstrosity of a furnace that burned propane in addition to wood, coal, or whatever was thrown in…) and fashioned up a motor tube with some scrap pipe, scrap metal, a welder and drill press. One of those classic 20 minute Dad jobs. 

M80 went in, fuse out a drill hole. The dad hammered the chuck of wood into the open end… aimed, lit the fuse and the three of us stood back to watch. The target was the pond between our house and Uncle’s (Dad’s brother) house. Going for a big splash! 

That hunk of wood launched and it soared… and it overshot the pond. And Dad start’s going “oh shit oh shit oh shit” as the hung of wood is over his brother’s house… thankfully cleared the house and cratered in the empty lot.

Wow that was so stupid. 😂😂😂",2023-01-30 05:46:21

~~Edit: I'm not sure why I'm expected to limit my view while driving on roads with zero lights when I'm driving with factory settings.~~ got it, if my light are misaligned, that makes sense

Don't get me wrong, I get how it feels to have a larger vehicle behind you with their lights, or coming at you. My truck is nowhere near the largest thing on the road, it is a midsized suv. I get it. What I don't do, is turn on my high beams because there is a larger vehicle coming at me. That's some asshole shit.

Final edit: *The problem is not with the angle of my headlights.* The problem is that I was whining on this post and gave the impression that it is everyone who is flashing their beams at me. When in reality it's a small percentage of people who do it but it's really annoying when they do thus my complaining. 

The irony that my whining was wishing that I had this solution and instead coming off as an insensitive asshole is hilarious. And I shall take this energy and fuel the rest of my day. Have a good one my dudes!",2023-01-09 13:31:29

sn0mol,"fellow beardie owner 🥰 yep, mine doesn’t usually need to drink like this because he’s often hydrated or over-hydrated (his humidity isn’t an issue) but it’s something lots of people do. beardies especially as desert animals are way better at retaining water than humans and if he eats more hornworms / bloobs his poops will be accompanied with a nasty squirt. but yeah reptiles are evolved to avoid getting a parasite from standing water and will prefer to drink if it’s something like a bubbly foot spa / fountain and inexperienced beardie owners who don’t know this cause dehydration. we also give him his calcium supplements by sticking the syringe in the corner of his mouth and squeezing until he starts licking it

n0lxe6,"You’re an Xennial. 😊 It’s a microgeneration that overlaps a little bit of GenX and a little bit of Millennials. Basically described as having the “healthy skepticism of Generation X and the optimism of Millennials”. Also called the “Oregon Trail Generation”.

I’m close to the end of GenX too (‘75), typically by definition just outside of the Xennials, but I definitely see a few of those traits. I definitely see a significant difference between the earlier GenXers and the late GenXers like us. 

It’s interesting to read about.

upqg61,"I used to worry about that, too. Then I read somewhere that crying is a physiological response to an imbalance of chemicals. Which is what emotions are, after all. So crying is a function of a well-functioning body. 

The fact that you feel things so deeply is a good thing. The world is full of selfish and unfeeling people. It's the most passionate ones that make the most change. ❤",2022-05-15 03:59:08

Nobody gives a shit if you don't know. (And anybody that does give a shit will either happily tell you, or isn't worth your attention anyway if they judge you for it.)

As for the answer... I think someone has given a great explanation on one of these that were going around recently.

Trust me, I'm a Scientist in this plasticky, melty, flamethrowy area of study. 🧐",2021-06-22 18:16:02
o5tacj,"Right?!

I wonder how long a worker has to do this.
Like, what's the game plan? 

Do they have a set number of seats they have to do in a day, or is it more sectional? 

I wonder how repetitive it is, and if they just do nothing but that, all day, with no breaks of doing other maintenance. 

It seems like they would have a sore back from leaning and holding the flame thrower out meticulously over and over throughout the day.

And do they have a bag or a cart with refills of the fuel? Or is it large enough (but heavier than smaller cartridges) to just carry the flamethrower and basically nothing else?

Hmmm 🤔 I didn't realize I had so many questions about this job. 😄
I still have more, if anybody is able to enlighten us.",2021-06-22 18:14:13

lsa654,"OMG. You just reminded me about a moment in college some years back. 

Studying Canadian politics, prof taught us that Parliament is in session when (I can’t remember who) knocks on the closed doors with a big black rod. He gets let in, parliament is now in session. 

A pic of ‘the big black rod’ wasn’t in the book, so I asked if she could put it up on the projector so that we could all see it. 

😐

While still lecturing, she typed it in and turned away from the screen. DOZENS of big black COCKS were now on the big screen and this 50+ year old woman started SCRAMBLING to turn off her computer after the entire class of social work students started freaking out. I sat there, mouth open, completely shocked at what had just happened. 

Now, I’m a pretty dirty girl, so EVERYONE thought I’d done it on purpose. I HADN’T! I genuinely wanted to see the big black rod that called Parliament to session!

p3exln,"Thank you so much for saying this. I have OCD and severe episodes can be debilitating. worrying myself sick, not able to sleep or eat.  I know my thoughts are lying to me but “what if...”. 

OCD is considered one of the most under-diagnosed mental health conditions, and unfortunately it is very misunderstood due to jokes like this. If your OCD was “going crazy right now” over this video, you’d be having panic attack-level anxiety and you would be crippled with fear.  Education on this disorder is so important and needs to be taken seriously. 💜",2021-08-13 12:57:39
p3exln,"I feel you, I would eat straight down one side like I'm digging a hole for a post. Then I would scrape up the side of that hole taking a little bit from each layer in one bite. It was how I managed to get those things to last 4 or 5 sittings lol it's not how most people enjoy ice cream. 

I love me some black cherry though 🤤",2021-08-13 03:48:04

I took a screenshot tho, seeing as this might happen.
[This is the link](https://imgur.com/a/8QuAjiA) 

Even though it was speeded up slightly, the precision is still impressive. If you are truly a chef, and you say you don’t have the materials at home, what keeps you from making a video of you doing this at your workplace?

You still haven’t answered my earlier point that you have no proof that you are a chef or even smart enough to make Mac and cheese in the microwave. Please answer that point before trying to appear superior to everyone on this thread. You just look arrogant.

Also, you said tons of other people in the food industry said the same thing as you. Find me 15 comments about this. That’s not anywhere close to “tons” so it should be easy.

Also look at the enormous amount of comments that *aren’t* saying that.

j96de9,Congrats! That’s awesome! Come do mine? My husband won’t throw away anything and his idea of cleaning the garage is putting more of his junk on my side 😡,2020-10-11 18:58:10
j96de9,YESSSSS!!! You absolutely rocked this! ❤️,2020-10-11 19:55:54
j96de9,"Both! :) But I’ve been crocheting more as of late. Knitting was my first love, though. I had hoarded so much yarn... I ended up donating 5 trash bags (I think?) full of high quality yarn. I can’t wait for somebody to find it at Goodwill and be so excited. 😊",2020-10-11 16:22:27
j96de9,"So, this may not be a good idea for everybody, but I brought the mess inside. Rather than staying in the garage where things were out of sight/out of mind, I’d bring boxes inside and dump them in the middle of my living room. I have 4 cats, a corgi, and a husband, and they were not pleased by this lol. It just forced me to do something about it then because the mess was RIGHT THERE rather than hiding in the garage. Also, sort by category. That helped me so much. I could look at a T-shirt and say “I have on just like this” and toss it, when before I would have kept it because I wouldn’t remember I already had one.

The hardest part for me was just starting. I’ve got ADHD and the executive dysfunction was so bad, I’d just sit there willing myself to organize but could not force myself to do it. It was almost panic attack inducing. When I finally got therapy and meds and my therapist told me to just start with the idea of doing one box a weekend, that was it for me. Once I started with that one box, I didn’t stop, and I just kept going. 

Best of luck, and don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it. If it’s rooted in depression, please seek counseling. I’ve been in counseling for the past decade but didn’t truly appreciate it until I found my most recent therapist who truly gets me. It’s been life changing for me.

If I can do it, anyone can! Good luck! ❤️",2020-10-11 18:34:11
j96de9,"Lol, nah. That’s just when we moved into our current house. I’ve been on SSRIs for 12 years now. I panicked thinking maybe I was bipolar because all of a sudden I’m happier and I have more energy, but my therapist told me that I’m just experiencing a normal mood for the first time in a decade. It’s surreal. Hope you feel better soon, too. ❤️",2020-10-11 20:54:28

It’s just that I know a few people with super pretty and perfect-like handwriting like this, and coincidentally they are all Asian. 
Not sure if it’s a cultural thing, but that’d be super cool. Kind of like how America was back in the day with penmanship as a school subject. But nowadays they don’t even teach cursive anymore 🙃 oh well",2020-09-07 23:54:27

I have read some of the comments, but I'm usually pretty hesitant to read comments because a *lot* of the ones I get are the ones saying I write too slow, they hate it, and that I fail all of my classes because I can't keep up with notes, which isn't true at all 😂",2020-09-07 20:39:13

n74v6r,"I dunno how USA restaurants are cos I’ve never been there. I live in finland and most of our restaurants actually have a different menu for Chinese if you ask and they make more authentic dishes. Sometimes you can just ask the cook to make a dish not on the menu if you want.

Most of the Chinese restaurants here still cater towards the local taste which kinda makes the whole Chinese restaurant redundant cos the taste is nothing like what you would actually eat. 🤫🤭

I’m just happy you liked it. I wish more people can taste Asian delicacies. To be honest if you can only go to one place in asia go to singapore( lived there for 8 years). Singapore has pretty much the most authentic food from as many places cramped in one place. Of course you won’t find every kind of local delicacies but it’s good enough if your only visiting asia once.",2021-05-07 21:48:09
n74v6r,"Oh god, Taiwan baozis are soooo good. 爆汁鮮肉包 🤤

I feel like Americans are becoming more and more adventurous, open-minded and curious with different ethnic, traditional food (slowly but surely), so maybe someday it'll be a lot more commonplace. Baozi are easy to love though, it's really like a steamed bread dumpling with ingredients that aren't all that foreign or ""weird"", so I think it'll eventually become more popular (especially now that the AAPI community is getting more recognition and representation).",2021-05-08 02:23:08

It appears to be a logarithmic spiral. 

I imagine if it were cold enough and the hole was the perfect size, allowing it to freeze at just the right speed...

It could be legit.

yw10ed,"We say that forces are carried through virtual particle exchanges, ie you can think that the particles interact with each other by sending each other virtual particles. 

An electron is an excitation of the electromagnetic field, so what happens when two particles interact, according to some theories, is an exchange of a virtual particle. A virtual particle is transitive, it exists temporarily and for our calculations, but it does have real effect and consequences.

If you are pushing electrons around, you are also creating magnetic fields, if I have some magnetic field and you push an electron through my field, I will be able to measure the interaction of the electron with my field. 

So as the electron is flowing through “my” magnetic field it interacts with it. Well, the electromagnetic field interacts with itself. 

These interactions propagate and affect the measurement tools.

Think about it like this; you have a lake; the water isn’t moving. You have a ruler that measures the depth of the water and put it in the water. The measurement is done by counting the highest wet point.

You then throw a rock inside the lake. This creates a wave. The wave makes your ruler look as if you put it in deeper.

The rock is the initial particle interaction, the interaction propagates through the field/lake, and interacts again with your ruler/measurement device.

The information is the wave. It doesn’t tell you everything, it tells you something. You need the correct measurement and interpretation to get some meaning out of it. 

Hope I didn’t confuse you any further 😅

NB all this is handwavey.",2022-11-15 20:46:56

qzn67z,"There’s a much easier version done with a balloon and cutting a ring of plastic from a thin plastic bag. Rub both on your hair in dry weather and the thin ring of plastic will be repelled from the balloon and “float” (same negative charge because latex and plastic collect electrons in their valence shells) With practice, the floating ring could be pretty stable, but not as stable as the field from the charged pan (but perhaps I’m a klutz) 🙂",2021-11-23 04:55:43

Sorry to hear your dreams of writing didn’t pan out. Like anything, you have to keep working at it and applying yourself to develop the skills that can make you able to create the work you really desire. It’s never too late to pick it back up. To me, there’s nothing sadder than giving up on a dream. I hope you achieve the things you want in life my friend.",2020-03-15 14:30:59
fiz20v,"Lol, I don’t even remember writing that. The better question is what kind of sad guy deeply searches someone’s comment history to pull out some old random comment made in jest and imbue it with meaning it never had? I’m not that depressed, but knowing you are out there doing and thinking the things you do does in fact make me more depressed than I was. I don’t take any of this shit seriously and neither should you, it’s really not worth either of our time or energy. Thanks for your concern, it actually seems somewhat genuine albeit misguided.

iw6hvs,"As someone who sprays stuff like this for a living, let me explain :)

An effect like this is going to require about 5 different types of paint. 

1) A primer


2) A base (a solid flame red in this case).


3) The candy base (which is a transparent red, which gives the effect of a boiled sweet). This car looks as though it's received around 2-4 coats to get that depth.


4) (optional, but this has had one) - A candy intensifier - another candy in a different colour. Sometimes it's a different shade of the first candy, sometimes it's a different colour altogether. This looks like the intensifier was either a black candy, or deep wine red. This can also be applied in multiple coats.


5) Finally, 1-2 coats of top coat, which is the beautiful gloss finish. This bit is the fucker. You get a hair, or a speck of dust failing into that, and you need to reeeeeally carefully pick it out, or wait for the whole thing to dry (8-12 hours) and buff it out and re-gloss that panel.  What also makes it a pain is that the pressure on your gun, the temp of the spray room, the quality of the underlying layers, and the mix of your paint (and the skill of the painter) is going to determine if you get a mirror flat finish, or orange peel and distortions. Most people therefore do two coats of top coat. The first one seals in the first 5 layers, and you can then sand and buff the whole car to remove any imperfections, and the second coat is thinner, which drapes over the whole thing like a glaze. Beautiful when it's done right.

Other difficult things to note - if you spray like this professionally, you need an incredible spray room. Tens of thousands of £ usually. The best ones are huge ovens that can heat to 80c to bake the paint (the one at my work is like this). They can also have constant running waterfalls around the walls that trap airborne dust.

It is so, so, so hard getting panels to match if you need to redo anything at a later stage. Say the car gets a ding, and that panel needs redoing. You have to reapply every layer in the exact same way for it to match. Each paint is usually a mixture of 3-4 components (like a base, hardener and thinner), and you can play with these ratios for different effects. Every coat has to be the same as it was originally painted, and if you haven't taken good notes or someone else painted the original, this has to usually be done by eye.

Good sprayers get paid an absolute bomb, because it's a real talent to do this. And it's time consuming too. The fun thing, is you can do soooo much to customise the job! You can add chameleon paints, colour flips, metal flakes, holochromatics, glow in the dark paints, heat sensitive paints, airbrush detailing... sooooo many cool effects, in whatever quantity and order you want.

Welcome to the work of automotive spraying :) if you search on YouTube for custom car/bike/helmet paint job, you'll find a rabbit hole of this stuff!

Edit: since people are asking - here is a good video showing the different processes and techniques that go into paint jobs like this. [This guy is incredible,](https://youtu.be/HpD4bmewQXk) he combined the effects I described above with stuff like pinstriping and even gilding! Goes to show how totally customisable this type of painting can be. It's a good example of what candies can do too.


Edit 2: Thanks for all the awards and gold! Wow, Ive been on Reddit for 7 years and this has been my first gold ☺️

Edit 3: Final edit :) I stumbled across this video just now that explains just what goes into a black cherry colour, and highlights just how much of a change in effect you can get from different base coats. [Enjoy!!](https://youtu.be/5EWHGh8M77E)",2020-09-20 09:25:24

iw6hvs,"Aw thank you :) I feel a little like an imposter now 😅 I'm a painter, but not a professional automotive sprayer. I paint models for the film industry, so I'm a jack of all trades. I had to learn automotive techniques for a film job veeeeery quickly, and ended up just getting interested in it. Now I tend to do most of the custom spray jobs our department needs. I'm a lot cheaper than a real automotive sprayer, and work in house, so I still get to play with this kind of stuff every so often 🙂",2020-09-20 20:06:44
iw6hvs,"Definitely :) a good gun and airbrush make all the difference though. Ive done a lot of research on replicating a candy spray finish with an airbrush onto a small job that was made from flexible polyurethane. It had to look like this car, but really flexible. Ended up replicating it pretty well with alcoholic inks and a flexible 2K called Imperiflex. Most of the work is just trying to bend the rules ☺️",2020-09-20 21:02:18

10a45h6,"Two observations about owning a Border Collie:

No matter how dirty they get, within 5 minutes if being inside the house they are clean again.  I mean spotlessly clean.  Somehow the dirty, dusty, mud, nuclear fallout just falls off them and onto the floor/sofa/bed.  They are spotless, but they leave a trail of dusty to be cleanee up.

When a Border Collie runs just watch how quickly they can change direction.  It's like their spines are made of jelly, they go like the clappers, and instantly can do a 90°, 180°, 270°, even a 360° turn and keep going at the same pace.  If my German Shepard, Yorkie, Hunter dog runs at full pace and does a turn, it's like a car doing a slow motion drift normally with them ending up in a hedge or ditch.  Border Collies have amazing range of motion (and emotion 🤣)",2023-01-13 01:44:31

Our current border collie may only round up his toys, but the time we had a big windstorm that scattered the beverage cans and bottles all over our yard, he cleaned them up into small piles around the yard, and when I went out to bag them, they were sorted between tin and plastic; not one pile were a mix of the two!

y52nhm,"Well yeah I mean it's such a time saver and it always tastes great, and it's only a base. I add flavors to the batter if desired. But the best part is the stuff that goes on the cake itself.

9y82o3,"Holy shit this brings back memories of my crazy ass uncle who we’d visit every summer when my brother and I were wayyy too young to be visiting my crazy ass uncle.

My younger brother who’s a ginger and has a ton of freckles asked uncle joey one day where freckles come from. My uncle then spun a tail about how your face is actually a city of hundreds of little people all going about there business, when it’s cold outside and there’s no sun, the white people go about their business. But, when it gets sunny, all the black people poke their heads out the window to enjoy the sun, which is where freckles come from.

I can’t even think of a weirder or more incorrect response to that question and I don’t really remember how my younger brother took it but I’m sure my parents had to have a long talk with him at one point to straighten it all out. 

I still get weird Christmas gifts from him all the time. A few years ago he sent me a jesus christ action figure with real glow in the dark hands. No one in our family is particularly religious but I guess this caught his eye for some reason 🤷‍♂️.

You’ve got a unique opportunity as an uncle (or aunt for that matter) to make some really strange memories for your niece and nephew that they will cherish and ponder for years to come.",2018-11-19 01:20:18
9y82o3,"That hilarious but regardless of whether or not your kid understands your husband now, at some point the kid will start picking up on these big words and concepts that your husband is telling them about.

A while back I read that in some cultures, parents don’t use as much “baby talk” and simple language with their kids so they grow up with a solid grasp on adult socialization and language. So some cultures would say that your husband using the word “esoteric” around your kid is actually good parenting.

Hell, I couldn’t give you a good definition of “esoteric” right now, with any luck your kid will have a better vocabulary than most college students by the time they hit middle school 😂.",2018-11-19 04:16:43

9y82o3,"Oh we went on to explain to him what it meant! When he was a wee little baby I spent an immeasurable amount of time reading about everything and anything that could be helpful to his mental development in any possible way. As a result, we have never used baby talk with him, and his vocabulary has consistently been leagues above the benchmark. So I can attest to the benefits of not simplifying things (within reason) when teaching your kiddos! 

Occasionally he will make an observation and then explain it to me in the most elaborate manner, using 3 or 4 syllable words and full sentences it’s very impressive! Sorry if I’m bragging, but he makes me so proud to be his mama every day! Hopefully, by the time he reaches college, he will have a better vocabulary than either my husband or I will ever acquire! 🤣",2018-11-19 05:15:48

It was water and blood proof so sweat and blood wouldn't cause them to open but urine would.

And I mean quite literal as we were full jet engine engaged and speeding for liftoff for another few seconds before the break. Thats when I realized why its great to have your tray lifted up before landing or taking off :D... Anywho, I wonder what is organized differently here. Can the landing plane still lift up so quickly to avoid collision?

yykym8,"Too good of a story not to share:

In highschool, I was really... Sheltered/naive to a lot of things, but really outgoing and well rounded in others. Anyway, I had a really good friend who I knew liked me. I was like, dude is too good of a dude to not give a real chance. So we were out at a stock car race, it was his thing, his whole family raced. We were on the slope just outside the track, watching the races from the best most private spot.

I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT ANYTHING THAT WAS EXPECTED TO COME AFTER THIS! I just want that known. I was like 15-16, he was 17-18 I think. 

He starts talking about how it's a 'grower' not a 'shower' and is like... Messing with his pants. He seems nervous as hell, like almost panicky. I'm sitting here thinking he's about to pull something out of his pocket. I said ""Wait!"". He jumped and swore and apparently got something stuck in his zipper. Then started talking about how hard it was to shave it all for me.

I determined he was absolutely trying to sell me drugs and I left. We didn't talk for the rest of high school. Had a good laugh about it later, when he had a lady and a kid and I knew a bit more about life. 😅😂",2023-05-11 22:08:57

x03h7t,"Ngl but that is not always how it’s done.
I was an aircraft loader for 2 years and we never saw this snake mechanism, most of the times some planes ( mostly airbuses ) had a moveable floor or in the worst case were like this Boeing that just has a normal floor and we were actually shooting the luggage from the door to the back ( almost 3-4 meters, sometimes a bit more depending on the plane  ) and after stacking them like this guy ( yeah I know we broke a lot of luggage ).

Also for the guys that will say throwing luggage like that is not right and can damage the luggage I will state the simple fact that on average a luggage  is 8-13 kg and mostly you can fit about 3-4 vertically so we can just do some simple math that on average the bag in the bottom will have an average of 24-39kg on top of its self, note that it’s not always flat bags or reinforced bags so yeah most of the times the damage is done in the stacking ( but it’s not like we could do it otherwise ).

😂😂😂 My brother, I'm a professional woodworker. I've made dozens of tables, chairs, cabinets, etc. Many tabletops I've made using reclaimed lumber that has defects which often need to be addressed for the table to perform as intended.

This being what looks like a dining table, it will likely see food and liquid spills. So, I'm inferring that the owners would prioritize ease-of-cleaning, which means a smooth contiguous surface. That's primarily why I'd lean toward filling the split with something like resin or an inlay.

The structural repairs performed were adequate, but the paint + finish work is *awesome*. However, I'd be somewhat concerned that normal wear and tear would abrade that finish and expose the less-than-ideal fillers underneath. They'd be calling this artist back to repaint, rather than letting it age gracefully.  What I proposed would avoid that eventuality. 

I'm not knocking this guy's skill at all. He's amazing. It's a philosophical difference. To me, this is like a bald man deciding to wear a toupee to cover up a perceived flaw. Nothing against the talents of the wig-maker, but I'd suggest   shaving the scalp and making the bald look work first. 

> That doesn’t sound like preserving the “character “.
>
>Sounds more like preserving the “crack”.

So you're just here for a semantic argument? Ok, I am fine to disagree on what we subjectively consider ""character"". 

>Sounds like you’re just jealous and envious of the man’s skill and craft and wanted to have a dig at him so you could sleep better tonight.

What? Show me where I took a dig? Sounds like you're attacking a straw man because you're bored and inclined to argue. That, or just trolling 😂",2023-06-05 00:09:24

Man how can we fix this oil spill. I guess the only solution is to spray it with another oil based product that will disperse the oil into what the FDA was paid to call a non-harmful amount of oil. 
Hey oil company that spilled all this oil can you take the oil you have and turn it into oil dispersal stuff and then we will buy your oil based Oil from you to clean up your oil for you. But first let me wag my fingure at you... 👈☝👈☝👈 k now I hope you learned your lesson. Also I know this spill will cost you a lot with your share holders so just go ahead and raise the gas prices so you can pass this loss, from gross negligence on you part, over to your consumers. Dont worry we'll give you a bunch of tax breaks so you can give you and your share holders huge bonuses and dividends.",2019-10-20 07:29:15

Electricity? A boiler? I just don’t get YOU’RE point? First off the garage makes complete sense to melt snow on cars, 4 wheelers, side by sides. Oh shit those things are probably a frivolous waste of resources 😫

The funniest part is you justified the driveway, which is by far the most wasteful part of the system. Just pumping hot glycol throughout your whole driveway, with no insulation or anything to catch that heat. Extremely inefficient. I guess the only reason you have my attention is I can see YOU’RE point, there are moments where people do dramatic over the top things that waste money, time, and resources. This isn’t one of them",2022-10-11 04:55:26

jbwosn,"These make a great group gift for the holidays!! 

For my team, I bought stamps with initials, small lighters, bulk wax sticks (think candles) in many colors and bulk kraft paper notecards with envelopes.  I mixed and matched the wax  sticks and tied each bundle with a ribbon. 

I wrote a personal letter in one of the notecards and sealed the envelope with my own initial stamp (helped the young whippersnappers know what they were getting!). I put a link in my letter to a YouTube video showing how to melt the wax sticks and use the seal. 

I placed the stamp, ribboned wax bundle, some notecards and a lighter topped with my card in small gift boxes lined with tissue paper. 

Amazon has all of the above items for reasonable prices. The stamps were the most expensive part at about $6 each. 

They were truly original gifts that I knew they probably had not received before. 😊",2020-10-16 02:16:37

Diffusion would be in this case modelled by Einstein's law of Diffusion, and would take over a month to travel that distance. That's why we need a bloodstream and not just trachea or what have you (mass flow does occur in trachea also).

Fick's is used when modelling flux, across some membrane, with constant gradient.
For example, in agar, the convective currents are prevented and luminol or whatever takes a few weeks to visibly diffuse under magnification even.

Uhhh.... Yeah I just need to cut my drywall to 1180mm instead of 1200mm. 😂 They're measurements someone can wrap their head around - especially when working on something practical.   
   
If metric had something nice and convenient between a cm and a meter, it would be a lot more practical for stuff like trades when you need to envision things quickly.",2022-10-30 10:18:44
yh43o4,"No need for me to cope, I can convert measurements in my head, like every other adult. I’m not the one with the pea brain thats occupied with hatred for measurement systems like a 10 year old. But keep projecting “cope” 😂",2022-10-30 10:01:44
yh43o4,"That's why I worded it specifically as I did. I have had rulers with them, but I have never seen them used when things are expressed. Say, a plan. My floorplans default to cm. But a 200cm wall might as well be a 400cm wall in trying to visualize that quickly. So I convert the plan to feet and inches when I start. The wall doesn't change shape regularly. So I'm not too worried about changing between units often or whatever.    
    
Or humans. Being whatever number of cm tall. Da fuq? I do not need to stack humans end to end. Why do I need a measurement that's base 10 so it's easy to convert between how many mms tall 2 of the humans are, or how many meters of space I need when I'm stacking them end to end? 🤣 **(Special exceptions for murders and such who need to fit bodies with precision)   
     
BUT...What I'm talking about is the subject of this whole thing...the video above. Does that look like a ""let me convert base ten units easily, because calculating is so easy now!"" situation?   
    
That's a ""OK, I have a 2' section, 4', 2 6' sections, 4 8' sections, and I need to score for bending 6 2x4' pieces"" kind of situation.
  
We use metric for things where it's needed. We use the modified, simplified imperial for practical use that humans can visualize. As mentioned, milling practice is also an issue. A 2x4 isn't 2""x4"".

Millimeters are utterly useless for nearly any practical building application, for several reasons (material expansion and contraction, material drying over time, etc.). Meters are too big for most practical building applications. I'd always learned a dm as like a hand width (although I've never measured my hand, and considering they tell kids that, I am not sure at what age you reach ""average dm""). The dm also seems too small/impractical for most practical building applications.

Break allllllll the rules and support the Random and Arbitrary But Practical Unit (RABPU) as an addition to the metric system. So people can use it. I wanted to name it for myself, but cm is already in use. 😭 Oh well. RABPU is perfectly easy to remember and pronounce. 🤣",2022-10-30 11:47:17
yh43o4,"No. It's on the small side and it's not used in applications like material measurements for building. That's what I meant by convenient. Something that's actually practical, easy to visualize quickly, and in common use. How could it be convenient if it's not printed on your building materials or whatever? 

This is why I have invented an entirely new unit for which I have not yet picked a definition yet, because I am not quite awake enough. 😝  We could use the King's foot. That's an original idea.",2022-10-30 12:03:25
yh43o4,"😂😂 the fact that this occupies your brain so much is hilarious. I'm sorry your smooth brain can't handle converting measurements like the rest of us, sounds like you're the one who's slacking in the evolutionary chain. I'll pray for you.

138l97z,"A lot of hair follicles have more than one hair in them. I think on your head, a single follicle has like five hairs on average. Body hair is thinner so it's usually only one or two, but just have ""hair twins"" as you put it in not abnormal. 

I have blonde body hair for the most part (as a woman it's pretty nice how little you can actually see it) but I get those random black hairs, too, mostly on my stomach, around my navel. I don't know why I have a cluster of them there, significantly darker than my pubes, four inches lower, which are light brown/dark blonde. One of these black hairs is a ""hair twin"" as you called it, and sometimes only one pokes out, and there's currently a little black dot under the skin where they should both be growing 😅 maybe I'll needle it this weekend and see what happens",2023-05-05 17:40:47

138l97z,"I would agree.  I was not established with a dermatologist, I had good insurance but I was a broke college kid that had just gotten married and my wife was a broke college kid going to nursing school. Being a biomed major I had a sterilized sample container had sterilized all of my equipment and planned on checking that I got good margins under a microscope cause I had the supplies at home to do so 😅",2023-05-05 15:11:30

j0pomz,"That’s actually common practice. Whenever working with mirrors or plexiglass, I’ve always been told to leave the protective coating on as long as possible, which often meant letting the end user peal it off. Most often however, it would remain on through fabrication but removed at the end of install. 

Now the plexiglass in my bedroom door (that I didn’t build) had its coating left in place even while the fake mullions were placed over it making near impossible to remove every last bit of it 😡",2020-09-27 23:53:32

pj168f,"Can you tell what's the purpose of each one? It really seem to be well though through given the experience, but I don't see whats behind the roman experts VS my naive reasoning who never built a road 🤣

If the earth is already flat and compacted I don't see the benefit of big stone? I would assume they distribute the load but as it's flat and compacted already I don't see the advantage.

Or alternatively if we take big stones why make the ground flat if the big stones make it uneven.

Then why two layers of concrete? What the benefit of the mixed gravel one as separate unit?

But let's say we take the mixed gravel concrete. Why not go directly with the final pavers layer?

Maybe someone else is curious too ☺️",2021-09-06 20:22:21

zb29wk,"One thing about improv is it doesn’t ALL come out genius. So some shows like “Whose Line is it Anyway?” will edit and keep the best skits/games, and cut out some of the “flops”. Though they often keep a “flop” as well, since even those happy accidents are funny in themselves, like a bloopers or outtakes reel. 

I have done a lot of improv and been to other troupes’ shows. There really is a lot of fantastic genius in the art of letting your imagination go and committing with confidence to whatever pops out of your mouth.

It’s actually a tribute to the genius and art that a person like our critic above is completely convinced that it couldn’t be done without scripting 😁",2022-12-03 22:24:16

Am I right?  We are waiting to purchase the upgrade glasses from our eye dr. once the tech improves.

p006ip,"I wouldn't know where to start!

I've gone from simple paints to cosplay foams to 3d printing to die casting to weaving machine -- basically have more tools and material than I have commissions. Reason why? Because I love learning about new stuff, BUT actually, because everyone has a 'favorite type' or some glues like Basting Glue are really niche and only used by quilters -- but has uses other places.

I found that the 3d printing community and laser cutting community is very popular and informative due to STEM -- but, what I like to do is called **Artificing** (which is a legally distinct term for Disney's Imagineer™) - a combination of artist, engineer, and producer. All of the creative skills being used in conjuction to accomplish something not necessarily pristine or beauty, but taking a dream/idea and making it reality in the easiest way. I'm a sorcerer honestly.

I don't really see it on the same level as prop artist or one thing because those don't really signify the whole ""you dream it, i'll build it"" methodology I use. Anyway, I ramble, I'm no looker for cameras.",2021-08-08 02:50:34

What was great was you got caught up in these random sports you never heard of and now these sports have become more popular. Like curling 🥌 or target shooting. I liked the race where they ran then had to stop and shoot a target. 

Now you’re lucky to catch the highlights unless you want to watch on the stupid app from your phone.",2020-08-05 16:15:41
i44dfo,"I've noticed it in figure skating for sure. I don't really follow Olympic sports closely in the off season but I love to watch, and these last few years of winter Olympics have heard people breaking records and doing moves never before seen successfully executed more and more.

Anyway same thing, eating and drinking hurt like hell. It hurt to just to turn over in bed and I couldn’t take a breath or even attempt to talk without going into a severe coughing fit. I wasn’t prescribed any medication so it was a hard month.

u5es59,"It's really nice to see, as someone that worked with chocolate for a few years. The thing that these videos don't show is how much control you have to have when working with chocolate - it's a material capable of amazing things, but you need to have the room the right temp and humidity, the chocolate tempered correctly and at the right temp for that strain or combo of chocolate, the mould the right temperature when you put the chocolate in, and the shell the right temperature when you add color or fillings. There are just so many ways for things to go wrong that it makes a successful finished project such a great feeling 😅",2022-04-17 13:31:02

12trrtw,"She ends the wave the way she does because she isn’t using a leash to tether her to her board. This always for easier “cross stepping” which is, in a way, not necessary to do to get up and down the board, but takes skill and looks stylish and graceful. Additionally, not using a leash is another nod to her skill and sort of homage to old school surfing. She in fact can, still cross step with a leash (usually if you are a cross stepping long boarder who uses a leash, you place it near the knee). All of this takes a degree of skill. 

If she doesn’t crotch down and grab her rail at the end, the board might get away from her and either hit another surfer (worst case) or get away from her and she would have to chase it into shore. 

Some other aspects of her wave riding is that the farther back she is on the board, the slower she goes (sometimes you want that). So she has a really good sense of where she needs to be on the board in order to stay on and with the wave.

I can do both of those things. And ski. And snowboard. And skateboard.

Know what I can't do? Paddle well enough to catch a wave. I want to learn to surf so bad but after a couple lessons still need a push to catch one 😭",2023-04-21 14:35:39

x3wrhl,"Honestly, feeding was the ONLY red flag we got from the breeder. Our puppy was from a litter of 13.  The owner of the mother kept her and the puppies in a kennel with a dog house during the day and in their attached garage at night or bad weather.  

He said he typically let them out into the yard to potty every couple of hours but to get them all wrangled back up, he would shake a dish full of kibble and dump it on the ground.  (Yes we have had her wormed. 🤮) Anyway, they would all come running and just go crazy fighting over the pile, eating as fast as possible.  I mean, I don't really blame the guy, with that many pups, it was probably the most efficient way, but still not good.",2022-09-02 18:19:30

>	Pontius Pilate[b] (Latin: Pontius Pilatus [ˈpɔntɪ.ʊs piːˈlaːtʊs]; Greek: Πόντιος Πιλάτος Póntios Pilátos) was the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judaea, serving under Emperor Tiberius from the year 26/27 to 36/37 AD. He is best known today for being the official who presided over the trial of Jesus and later ordered his crucifixion.

Then after retirement he kept cultivating his garden, every inch had a crop growing on the plot and he would bring fruits and veggies to the neighbours. 

Hard working lad with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. He would always prank me as a kid with some games. Going on errands with pops was always an adventure and I loved every min of it.

ve2y5y,"When they are young we found they were awful at having their get up to be hoofpicked (clearing out the dirt) but as soon as they had had their first farrier visit they were much better about it. Our horses used to enjoy it too the point that one horse was terrible for biting as she was a rescue. She never went for the farrier, only those who tried to take him away 🤣

My horse Sasha was funny because she would lift her foot below he asked but it was the wrong one. Nope refused. He had to work on that one first. Did all her feet with her lifting her next foot just as the other was finished. Got to the end and she picked up the first foot again. She got grumpy when he didn't start all over again. 

Opal my last horse put up with it. She loved being groomed and would back her butt into people with a brush and hunch it up, which made them think she was about to kick. Nope she wanted her hind quarters rubbed down with a brush. 

My mum's current horse doesn't mind however he does get bored and starts to play pranks apparently. If you have coats with the elastic string and the bobble he will grab it, pull it back and let go sending people flying. He loves to do this with the farrier. He'll also try to lick the farrier in places to make him giggle. Butt, ear, knee. Dude is a a sweetheart who wouldn't hurt anyone, he just loves a good laugh. 

When you see what happens to horses who don't see a farrier enough, and don't do enough walking to do natural wear, you can see why. They can't feel most of it. There is only blood supply in the centre of the frog (the triangle bit). It is a bit like having a manicure. Afterward they feel much happier on their feet as the extra stuff is taken away and their shoes feel comfortable again. 

Shoes are also more complex than people realise with different types used for different reasons. Some are like insoles used to help correct issues horses have with walking. Some even come with stud inserts that you can take in and out.",2022-06-17 09:26:09

ve2y5y,"The loose some power when there hooves are up like that so it makes it easier to control a kick out. If the horse got nicked then it would still kick out full power and the farrier will have to let go and let the horse calm down. They also have a little hoove stand so the farrier and horse don’t need to take the weight all the time. 

Working and tame horses start this process at a young age so they get used to it and just let it happen. My horse loves new shoe day, definitely not because the farrier gives him treats…….. haha 😂",2022-06-17 11:01:08

ve2y5y,"They definitely enjoy the extra attention. LOL Most horses operate somewhere around the intelligence/impulse control of a 3yr old toddler. So...make of that what you will. (They really are just giant spoiled babies.)

ve2y5y,"Oh wow. Thanks for the info. They are such gorgeous animals. 

My cousin had a horse farm, and also rented stalls to a couple ppl. They had 4 themselves but one of their friends who rented a stall told them about this miniature horse, and how she was rescued from a horrible family who bought her as a gift for their kids birthday, but had not a clue of how to take care of her, how to maintain her hooves and all that. When the SPCA finally stepped in and took her and two full sized horses, my cousin decided to take her in and try to rehabilitate her. They told them how she was severely neglected and malnourished, hair just totally matted. But they never mentioned anything about her hooves. When my cousins finally got her to the farm, their friend who brought her to my cousins got out and warned my cousin that it's a lot more complex and difficult then what the equine Dr's told them. She came out of the trailer and omg we all broke down. This poor baby could barely walk, she would take a step, stop for a couple mins and continue on that way. Her poor little hooves were like curling. U could see the pain in he eyes every step she took. It was horrific. They worked on her and thankfully got them fixed a lot better than it was, but she was never going to be 100% bc that's how bad her hooves were. U could count her ribs, and only 2 months into them having her, she started to plump back up and no longer could u see, let alone count her ribs. 

I felt horrible for that sweet girl. Her name was Pearl and the money and work and lovey cousin and her husband put into her rehabilitation was incredible. She sadly passed like 5 or 6 years after they got her, but we took comfort knowing that while her early life was obviously hell, the rest of her life she was loved and felt love and comfort and peace. She would have been gone a lot sooner had she not been rescued and brought to my cousin. 

Horse owners, vets and all that, they hold a special place in heart after seeing how much they put into little pearl.seeing their tears when she was first starting her rehabilitation, made me realize how amazing these ppl are.

I always knew it was very important to take care of their hooves, but I always wondered how they went about it before humans knew to do what they do now. Thanks again for the info, and I apologize for the long reply. ❤❤❤",2022-06-18 07:46:17

14e1vzl,"Seriously asking, can you genuinely not think of any possible explanation other then several of these drones regularly just falling out of the sky during shows over a densley populated city? Do you think these shows would happen at all if there was even a small chance that one of the drones will potentially fall from hundreds of feet and hit someone?


No, they don't just fall out of the sky, they would have a return to home function if there was some issue, and if that was also malfunctioning they would hover in place until they can be manually flown back by whoever is running the show. Seriously dude, it's like you don't even know the intricate details about safety protocols for DLS (which stands for Drone Light Shows... you god damn ignaramous🙄).

x2iuyf,"Yeah I've never felt any different from taking opioids. They literally just work as they're supposed to and reduce my pain. I'd love it if they made me a bit happier too lol. I developed some minor depression after 5 or 6 years of chronic pain. At about 9-10 years now. And yes, tolerance is real! Very real! I've been prescribed ketamine infusions to help my pain and to help ""reset"" my tolerance to opioids basically, but 99% of the infusion centers I've called don't take insurance and insurance apparently doesn't pay for it so I'm SOL. I had my pain management appt on Tuesday and have had to go to the pharmacy twice so far, going a third time tomorrow to finally fill my Rx's. The ordering limits they have is just so absurd. They literally had 10 oxymorphone pills left on their ordering limit for August. Luckily they can order more today to arrive tomorrow. This whole opioid crisis has really screwed over people with chronic pain who benefit from long-term, high dosage, opioids. 

Sorry to vent. Anyway, I know I got a study done years and years ago about how different opioids and medications affect my body. I'll need to find that again, maybe I can see something about my hedonic hot spots! 🔥",2022-09-01 11:20:27

126uffg,"Looks like this technique is called body marbling, and similar to what you did in elementary school with paper, you use non-toxic paint and apply it over a salt water bath.

Hydrodipping, or hydrographic printing, is used on 3D objects and typically requires an activator to help the transfer of paint to the object. The activator is typically a mixture of xylene, isobutanol, butyl, methyl acetate and b-butanone, and MEK.

evwj27,"I think we agree here. 

Only thing is, cups aren't even an imperial measurement, the US just happens to use both cups and the imperial system (dunno if I'm wrong here maybe).
The metric system and cups complement each other beautifully.

And I already said this somewhere in this comment section, but if your cup is 237, 250 or 255ml doesn't really matter in the end because the ratios should stay the same as long as you're using the same size cup for every ingredient. Most American recipes I've seen do that (with some exceptions like ""a handful of coriander"" but that's such an imprecise measurement anyway it doesn't really matter). 
It's not like we're talking vastly different cup sizes here anyway, 20ml at the most afaik and in that case big deal, you get 12% more food if you used the bigger cup. Hardly matters.

d131wp,"As far as the prismacolor markers (I own like 300 of them, it’s a bit of an addiction) just make sure that you test the paper you’re going to use it on first because I’ve noticed that it can bleed more than you would think on some papers and not bleed so much on ones you thought they would really bleed on. It’s weird and I guess depends on what blend they use in the paper. I really do like them though. The colors are true to the label, they last a long time and blend pretty well. They have the double ended ones too (tip and chisel) which have been my favorite for finer details. I hope this helps someone 🤗",2019-09-08 18:42:35

w5c2zf,🧐 😎,2022-07-23 02:04:10
w5c2zf,"Technically it is Chemiluminescence. Flame is also chemiluminescence, but it also usually contains incandescent particles(particles that light up because of high temperature), most of the light in flames tend to be incandescent particles.

Now when it comes to ***fire***, the fire starts when a flammable or combustible(A combustible material is something that can burn (i.e., combust) in air. A combustible material is flammable if it ignites easily at ambient temperatures.) material is exposed to a source of heat(and some source of oxygen) above the flash point and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. Once ignited, a chain reaction must take place whereby fires can sustain their own heat by the further release of heat energy in the process of combustion.

So from my understanding, fire has a seemingly arbitrary definition that includes heat energy whereby guess can sustain their own heat. Luminol does not seem to work through that seemingly arbitrary definition, hence it's not a fire/flame.

My inner boy was hoping it was awesome, while my outer man was skeptical, but I wasnt let down!! They jump those dang things like 20-30 feet! Taking eachother out in the air, and stuff! And the laps are all like15- 20 seconds long, so the repetition is kinda pleasant if you've ever watched racing! Idk if I'll be turning in every week, following the season, but definitely a positive experience!

li207m,"I’d heard the song 20 times over the radio and streaming when it came out and thought it was a catchy jingle about shoes.

Then one day Spotify put an acoustic cover of the song in my weekly recommendation list. I still didn’t pay attention to the lyrics until he said “outrun my gun.” I thought 💭 “well that’s not the right lyrics” but kept listening ...and as the denial melted away my eyes were wide open in shock and horror 😳.

fvenmk,"I’d made many videos like this, glad you like this one!
Steps:
- Shoot 2 videos: road, and wakeboarding (preferably at a similar time of the day so the lightings match).
- Stabilize both videos to make them easier to work with.
- Mask out the “blue” of the water in the wakebording video, and adjust the settings until it looks good enough.
- Mask out everything but the guy and the water splashes (this is dibe frame by frame).
- Animate the guy’s position to avoid the cars and stuff.
- Correct the color on both videos until they line up.
- Use the original wakeboarding layer (animated) as a displacement map to slightly distort the road video and make it look wavy/watery.
- Add back some camera shake.
- Post it on Instagram and get some hate for doing dumb things on the road 😜",2020-04-05 15:21:48

16vqg6w,"I’m Italian born and raised and so is he. He said “perfetto”. “Tutto molto ottimo” is indeed incorrect but it’s just a funny way of saying stuff. BTW, scrolling through your account for a few seconds I can tell by the way you write Italian that you’re not Italian yourself. Unless you write things weird just to sound overly professional or something. However, by the way you can’t distinguish a very clearly pronounced “perfetto” to a “perfecto”, my bet is that you’re not Italian and you’re just being annoying lol the nerve

Edit to reply to his new comment because he blocked me: it’s “fuori di testa” not “fuori di mente”. He probably uses a translator from English to Italian because that’s the literal translation of “you’re out of your mind” 😎👍🏻",2023-09-30 10:59:52

“We now have suggestive evidence that there is some level of conscious awareness in bees – that there is a sentience, that they have emotion-like states,” says Lars Chittka, professor of sensory and behavioural ecology at Queen Mary University of London.

“Our work and that of other labs has shown that bees are really highly intelligent individuals. That they can count, recognise images of human faces and learn simple tool use and abstract concepts.”

Chittka has been studying bees for 30 years and is considered one of the world’s leading experts on bee sensory systems and cognition.


They feed themselves, help feed us, help feed other animals, help maintain natural plant communities and ensuring production of seeds in most flowering plants.

It's incredible to think that a creature, with a brain that small, can navigate, communicate, count, recognize faces, use tools and now are showing evidence of conscious awareness. 🤯

When possible, plant some bee friendly wildflowers in your home to help our little friends do their magic and live. 🐝",2023-02-16 15:08:52

Bees aren’t picky about the comb being built specifically by their hive- in fact many hives come with artificial comb. 

It’s best however to uncap the honey and use a centrifuge to remove the honey and leave the comb intact. Bees use precious time, energy, and resources to build comb that could otherwise be used for building up their honey stores. 

If a really rough winter wipes your hive out and you have to purchase a new package of bees, they will settle in just fine in the hive with the old hive’s comb.",2023-02-16 04:29:44

d2smeo,Same. My mom home makes her fondant and it tastes like marshmallows. I still prefer normal frosting because I think it's too thick and chewy but it's definitely not bitter and disgusting like everyone's saying. Guess I've never had store bought rolled fondant either. 🤷‍♀️,2019-09-11 20:17:03

Seriously though, the man makes an art form out of it. We clean grocery store floors and strip/wax twice a year. With his long Luigi arms and his wax mop (wax mops are basically glorified floor swiffers lol) he can cover the entire width of an aisle with one swipe. He’s actually planning a strip/wax for next month, I’ll try to record him if I can (our first kiddo is due next week so I may or may not be able to get up there, but maybe I can talk one of the guys into recording him when he’s not looking lol).",2022-03-10 16:10:42

mle7dh,"Nah, I was a book reader, by season 4 the show was an absolute Hollywood joke of a good story. When I watched this scene and heard Arya compliment Brienne for killing the hound I laughed harder than I have in ages 😂🤣😂 if you're unfamiliar she killed an imposter, knowing it was an imposter at the time. I want to say the imposter was Biter, but it has been a hot minute Since my last read.

I actually started pushing away from the show in season 2 and only barely made it through season 4. It's now my go to example for movies based on books that look nothing like their source material.",2021-04-06 17:55:30

If you want to say that the ending of the series and the character arc is very poor, I'll completely agree with you. On the other hand, I see no reason why she couldn't have been chosen by the faceless men because she has some weird psycho killing abilities and that's why she's so good. 🤷🏽‍♂️",2021-04-06 21:49:21

On deployment, sharpening reminded me of my grandfather, so I did it for everyone in camp who asked, and they were pleased to ask, because I'm that good at it; too demonstrate I'd cut a new clean factory looking edge on their cigarette. I've been sharpening for decades, and fixing or learning about everything I can touch for decades. Learning the physics of metallurgy is a genuine joy for me, so I weld, and read about new alloys and applications.  I made knives, because  knives bring me closer to my Grandfather; he taught me how to sharpen, and bought my first one for me.  If you can skilfully sharpen a knife, you know by the sound it makes *when* sharpening, not your microscope. Stop being pretentious, because you sound like an idiot to those who know. I'll trust my science and reading about these jagged teeth over your opinion.

znbb11,"Not OP, but also a Geologist. 

Any of the corundum gems (ruby sapphire, etc) are actually rare and close in hardness to diamond (Mohs hardness of 9) and - in my opinion have more beautiful colors. 

The beryl series (aquamarine, emerald, etc) are also fairly rare as gemstone grade and have great color (My wifes engagement ring is an aquamarine). Morganite is a great choice for engagement rings and is a beautiful pink color and also quite resilient (Mohs hardness of 8). 

Tanzanite is another very rare mineral, but only has a hardness of 6-6.5 so it could be a risky stone for a life long engagement ring. 

Alexandrite is a great choice if you want a natural very rare gemstone. It has a double refractive index so it will change color depending on the type of light it is under and is very resilient with a hardness of 8.5. 

Hope this helps 😊",2022-12-16 19:02:41

 Disclosure: (Imo, is even better when the wipers are off for rainx. Lighting conditions vary, works best on dark highways with no light. YMMV don't do it if you're one of those people that brake on the highway with nothing on front of you, don't do it if you're scared, dont do it if you dont notice that you left your blinkers on for the next 10 miles. You the driver are not attentive enough to do this. I am not held liable as you are doing it at your discretion. Nobody on the internet is correct.)

tq6v9f,"My face 😲.

What a absolute nightmare of mine.

I've always had a fear of them. Now they just make me flinch, but I remember being 3 to 4 years old standing in my front yard SCREAMING as those tiny yellow ones flew around me. My dad would have to scoop me up and carry me in the house. It's just a reaction. Now my youngest is the same way. She hates to even look at them. She'd freak over this video.  ""They're basically worms with wings."" Have you seen their mouths?"" Lol. She's a hoot.

Factoid: Nicole Kidman also has a fear of butterflies.",2022-03-28 15:17:44

tq6v9f,I have a ton of seeds. I’ve been spreading them in naturalized areas this year. I grabbed pods at the end of the season that didn’t open fully. The pods are covered in orange bugs that may play a role in opening & spreading the seeds. It’s so pretty to send the seeds flying from the top of a hill.😍,2022-03-29 03:37:52

If you want a tip i would say, Keep your hands spread a little longer and move them together after you already take advantage of the leverage on the way down. I liked the swings where you let the head of the axe hang back a little bit because you get a similar effect to what im explaining. Ideally  the hands dont come all the way together until they are passing your face. Maybe even in front of the chest. Youll go right through that thing in one swing. And youll be able to get through sooo much more wood with the same amount of energy/skin on your hands. Less likely to have an accident as well 💜",2023-03-31 23:53:12

caa0mk,"I once did this with my dad. I had been painting and my dried, unused paint sat in tiny drops on my palette, looking like tiny m&ms. I know my dad is easily fooled so I presented him the paint drops as candy. He eagerly took a handful and ate them 😂 my mom and I were on the floor crying with laughter, as my dad was spitting the drops out with a mouth in all colours of the rainbow

egi2l9,"Thank you! He’s back on Monday. I’ll let you know what happens.


Edit: Update. - I went back to the office Sunday night with a six pack of Castle Danger Cream Ale, gift wrapped in mermaid wrapping paper and left it on his chair. I also hid half a roll of paper in another colleagues cubicle to frame him.

I arrived at work this morning at 6am to catch his reaction, he’s usually pretty early but today he came in around 8. He loved it. He was laughing in disbelief and kept saying “wow”

So far he’s only unwrapped his monitors, keyboard and mouse. Also, we discovered that he gets shocked when he gets up, walks around then comes back and touches his mouse so we’ve removed the wrapping paper under the mouse area as the paper appears to be the cause of that unpleasantness.

I’ve got video and pictures of everything but I do not have his permission to share it, so you will have to be satisfied with this update.

TL;DR - He loved it.

Edit Update 2: I told my colleague about this post, discreetly, and offered to delete it. He was concerned about privacy initially, but told me to keep the post up and enjoy my “Reddit Fame” - not two minutes later another colleague walked by and said “Imagine my surprise on Friday when I saw your cubicle on Reddit” - it had almost 700 upvotes at that time. 🥺",2019-12-27 22:42:06

vmybik,"I hope you're not being serious. That would be incredibly difficult, to the point of absurdity:

1.)You would need a freezer large enough to freeze the body. It's certainly not impossible,  but probably not something most people have private access to for the day plus it would take to freeze a corpse solid. Also, remember that the longer you have the body, the longer the authorities have to catch you with it.

2.)Have you ever tried sanding down something more than a few millimeters? It takes forever by hand, or even with an electric hand sander. A belt sander is an option, but even those aren't going to do what this video does, and you're certainly not going to fit that rotary sander over a sink. Sure, frozen human muscle is softer than wood, but it's going to be really tough. The bones would obviously be worse.

3.)Even if you can procure a sander both powerful enough to sand a frozen body down in the time it takes before it noticably thaws, *and* compact enough fit over a sink, you haven't accounted for the heat caused by friction. The layer being sanded would instantly thaw, especially at room temperature. So it wouldn't be a fine dust, it would be a filthy goop. That goop would be flung all around the room by the sander, getting all over you and everything else, spreading evidence *everywhere*. My roommate used an electric mixer on too high of a level mixing pancake batter once. When we moved out over a year later, there were still spots of it near the ceiling where I couldn't reach to clean it off. Now, imagine that's liquefied thigh clinging to the plaster. You would never find all of it.

Edit: how could I forget! The people goop would also quickly gum up the sander. Wood doesn't really do that, because it's ideally dry. People, quite famously, are around 70% not dry.

4.)Even if you somehow keep the room clean, you're coating the sink in DNA evidence. It's going to be very difficult to clean all of that out, even with diligent scrubbing and bleach. I certainly wouldn't trust myself to get it clean enough to avoid detection.

So, in conclusion, please don't dispose of bodies by sanding them down the drain. Even better, don't collect human bodies in the first place 👍

i5caj8,"Edit 2: putting this before my comment because My observation was wrong. I did some research, and found a longer version of OP’s video with audio and the rock has a natural split in it called a vein:

https://youtu.be/pbM3xXw4_ps

— 

My initial comment when seeing the crack prior to knowing about veins: 

I don’t know if this is just me not trusting anything on the internet these days, but looks like it was already cracked and held together, then fake cracked and separated for the video? 🤷‍♂️

Edit: to those downvoting, watch the video again and notice the line that exists on the rock exactly where it gets separated *prior* to it being hit with the hammer. I’m not saying people haven’t studied rocks to know which to break, but in this video, it might be set up for the reveal",2020-08-07 12:52:06

It is warm and dry enough in my area that I washed my sheep before shearing, but I haven’t processed raw wool before. There’s a process of “picking” aka “skirting” the wool to remove vegetation and poop, then “carding” and “spinning” to create yarn. I believe most people wash the wool between skirting and carding, but you have to take care not to remove the natural “grease” (lanolin) which dries the wool out.",2021-05-31 15:29:46

10rp31h,Absolutely! Should’ve been more specific. The crazy looks I would get from homeowners when I suggested this tip fueled me 😂,2023-02-02 15:58:21
10rp31h,"If you're using water-based paints, take the brush and dunk it into the sink under running water. Press the bristles down using the handle and repeat the motion while flipping the brush over. Don't SMOOSH it, just light presses, until you get clear water.

Get a spinner and spin the water out of the brush. If you don't have one, spinning with your hands will do the trick too.

Take some blue paint tape and wrap the tape around the metal part and the bristles. This keeps the moisture from flaring the bristles from the knuckle of the brush.

When you have GOOD brushes (Purdy, Woosters), they come with a cardboard sleeve. Always put the brush back in the sleeve. This sucks up the rest of the moisture.

This technique will keep a brush clean for at LEAST a year of heavy use.

If using oil-based paints, use mineral spirits, do NOT use water. If you're using oil-based paints, buy cheap brushes. Oil doesn't do well for brushes.

This technique is also good for rollers. But rollers are really only useful 2-3 times after cleaning.

I've been painting professionally for 5 years and these methods have served me very well. Hope they are helpful!!! 😊",2023-02-02 18:56:38

nhfb5c,"Who dictates what is male and female? Most of us henna artists encourage anyone that likes it to get it!

While traditionally, henna has been a female artform, there are MANY male artists that are well-known in our industry as well. They certainly practice henna on themselves and don't stick to a particular ""masculine/feminine"" stereotype of designs. 

Henna is also used in many parts of the world (where it grows natively) and spans many cultures. I'm from India, and even within India, there are cultures that don't use henna at all and there are cultures that can't do weddings and baby showers without henna application. At least one culture I'm aware of has men get henna very similar to this bridal style henna. Many others will commonly have the groom get a small token design as it's considered auspicious - many opt for their significant other's name or a heart with their initials or sometimes, just a design. 🙂",2021-05-21 09:32:29
nhfb5c,"Henna only stains things with keratin in it - skin, hair, nails, etc. It does not stain metals or diamonds.

nhfb5c,"And when you finally pick it all off, put vicks on your hands 😅",2021-05-21 05:18:32
nhfb5c,"Plastic bags = NOOOOOO! 🙅🏻‍♀️

When you wrap your mehndi in plastic bags, you'll end up trapping body heat in that bag which results in sweat, which turns into condensation, and it will smudge the once-dried henna design. That's when the designs kind of blur together from the moisture and you wake up with unwelcome blobs on your hands instead of precise designs done by the henna artist. 🤦‍♀️",2021-05-21 09:00:03
nhfb5c,"It has such a unique smell! And it is (in most henna artists’ opinions) definitely harder to work with than henna. Once it touches your skin it instantly begins to work - but you won’t even be able to see the stain from smudges until hours later when it’s too late! 😅Have definitely woken up with surprise blue fingers before. 

It’s a great option for those who want a darker or more tattoo-like stain without exposing themselves or the artist to a fake, colored ‘henna.’ Only downside beside the application nuances and higher cost is that because it comes from a tropical fruit, sometimes people are allergic to it! (Same allergy line as pineapples, strawberries, etc.)",2021-05-21 03:43:51

You can clean the car without a pressure washer. Makes it a lot easier to control how much water you blast into your interior. 

Diy home detailers don't go crazy with the water like this inside the car. There are controlling engine computers under the floor in a lot of cars. Or amps or brake controllers etc. 

EDIT: Everyone of his interior detailing products is meant to be dilated pretty heavily. Spraying that chemical guys green interior  stuff full concentrate is like washing your dash in lemon juice. There is a ton of acid in the mix and it can stain or remove dye especially in old black interiors. Like this one.

And it can seem really pessimistic to think about both the human and animal suffering happening on such vast scales today and throughout history. But here's where one can set onerself apart. Enlighten yourself on issues that you find concerning and try to act in the best way possible (animal agriculture being a big one). You're right in saying humans aren't necessarily humane.

The original with the pretension bullshit is called the Hang (no really) and *was* made by a Swiss piece of trash who like all good little bitches decided to take his ball and go home in 2014. Here's what they sell now with the original ""sound sculpture"" down at the bottom. Like check out this shit:

>On eBay and other sales platforms on the Internet second-hand Hanghang are offered at excessively high prices. These include instruments which are out of tune or those whose sound was strongly modified by other tuners. Sometimes instruments from other manufacturers are wrongly offered as ""hang drums"", which infringes our trade mark Hang®. Furthermore, you must be aware that those adverts are sometimes attempted frauds. In this context we also refer to our statement from January 2013.

You think most people would be pleased to have lent their stupid name to a new and beautiful instrument but nope its infringing on their rights your filthy bastard. Oh and its not a drum its the Hang.
