6nuqwh,Bruh I'm laughing so hard rn 😂,2017-07-17 21:19:45
6nuqwh," Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop? Yo -- I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.
Dance, Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye, The kid don't play
If there was a problem, Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them, if they ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, Waving just to say Hi
Did you stop? No -- I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead
Yo -- so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave.
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine -- All I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
Try to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene, You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, Yo -- I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla
Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step 
With this. Shay plays on the fade, 
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade 
So fast -- other DJs say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem, Yo -- I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it.
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla
Yo man -- Let's get out of here! Word to your mother!

Then they will scream there are new deadly strains that are being passed around from us unvaccinated folk, who are going out without masks, which will usher in the demand and outcry for a digital vaccine verification. They know exactly what they’re doing and we’re all playing right into it. It’s the same reason they started with paper vaccine cards, so they were easily able to be duplicated. It’ll just go hand-in-hand with the outcry for needing some sort of digital verification. This will not stop unless we stop it!

qxm20v,"I'm not saying that Bezos isn't exorbitantly rich, but I think a lot of people overestimate exactly how many lives could appreciably be changed by $200B.

With your analogy, he could give 200,000 people $1M, or 400,000 people $500k. 

There are ~330M people on the US. Let's say conservatively that 200M of them are working age and therefore could benefit from a Bezos Stimulus™. Everyone would get $1000 if his entire net worth was liquified and distributed to the eligible US populace (obv less if we sent it to everyone above 18).

Now $1000 is still a lot of money, but consider that the US government sent almost every 18+ citizen almost $2000 last year and no one's lives changed appreciably.

Jeff Bezos is filthy rich, but he is not the sole reason that you (or any other American) may be struggling. He's certainly a great lightning rod for corporate greed criticism though.

Edit: Since people are harping on the fact that Bezos is just one of many billionaires, let's do the same experiment with all [630 billionaires](https://questionerlab.com/how-many-billionaires-are-in-the-us) in the US. If we liquidated ALL of their assets and disbursed it equally among 320 million people, that's a one-time payment of $10,625 to everyone. Not a permanent raise, not a recurring payment, but a one time bought-a-scratch-off-and-won-10k moment. Now I'm not scoffing at $10k - I'd take it with a smile, but that's ten iPhones. Four MacBooks. A down payment on a car or (in some neighborhoods) a down payment on a very small house. 

Unless you are living in abject poverty, $10k is not life-changing money. It's very nice, but it's not life changing. It's less than one year of minimum wage salary.",2021-11-19 21:31:13

kx4u0q,Just drive by GPS 🙃,2021-01-14 15:14:44
kx4u0q,"I had this happen on Dead Man Pass OR back in 2011.  

It was the scariest shit I’ve experienced while driving. I was in a White Vw GTi and had snow tires so it wasn’t an issue with sticking to the road, it was the fear of not being visible then getting plastered by a semi.  

I also had no cell service in that area so I couldn’t check on weather conditions- it was really strange because at the bottom of the grade it was normal driving conditions. No heavy rain or anything, then BAM! I see what OP sees. Then of course the rest stop on the hill was closed too, I was planning to just waiting it out. 

Luckily after stopping in the middle of the road with hazards on for at least an hour a tractor trailer slowly creeps by, I get behind him and we both drove at 15-20mph together. 

That was the longest drive through that pass I’ve ever experienced. 

The trucker flashed his trailer lights & honked once we got to the bottom of the hill. I think we were both relieved to be out of there. 

At the bottom of the hill it was normal light rain. You’d have no clue a snow storm was up on the mountain. 

Normally I don’t drive through passes during the winter but my grandpa was on his deathbed after having a stroke so I sucked it up and went.

kx4u0q,"I used to live in the tippy top of North Dakota. Had to drive through this more than once on my way to work (over an hour commute each way) and leaving the state to visit family. Something many people don't know about North Dakota there's a lot of bodies of water that are level with the road, no guard rails or any shoulder before you hit the water.

kx4u0q,"When I was a kid in Connecticut my sister went to VPI in Virginia and we drove down to see her or something. Anyway, we're driving along this highway in Virginia with maybe 1/4 inch of snow on the ground while it gently snows. My dad thinks nothing about it because it's not like it's snowing hard or anything... So, we're just driving along at 60 or so, not really giving it any thought. Then we notice a car in the ditch, and another, and another. They were all in the ditch! Yeah, southern drivers don't know how to drive in snow 😎

Then there was my ex from California. She's visiting me in Massachusetts and she's using my sports car while I'm at work, and its forecast to snow, so I told her: ""drive at 1/2 the speed limit or less if it starts snowing"" because she's never driven in snow in her life... ""Yeah, yeah, I'm a good driver, I know what I'm doing"". Of course she spun out and collided with a snow bank... There's a lesson in there somewhere I'm sure!

75a0sl,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

Where he worked they had Bring your child to work day, but he would bring my brother and I instead. He was in charge of taking kids to the laboratory, where we needed coats and goggles and there were tubes of liquids spinning, huge machinery, microscopes and weird noises.

His setup for those days was showing us experiments with liquid nitrogen in the lab. He would put these huge gloves on and hold long tongs and put racquet balls in there, then drop it on the floor so we could see it shatter. He did it with a rose once as well and it was just SO damn cool.

The way to short cut your trip is milk, LSD base is acid and milk stabilizes it in your body, brings you down much quicker. Won't become sober RIGHT AWAY but at least it will cut your trip in half. Glass of milk, mostly it applies to a lot of drugs I've tried as well. Glass of milk is always the solution.

apy1q3,I would have given myself colon hydrotherapy 😂,2019-02-13 15:24:15
apy1q3,"Back when I was far stupider and all about ""the adventure"", I no-looked a random PacNW cliff into a triple waterfall in early November. It was my first cliff jump, and I was assured by the two others that they'd been doing it every summer since their teens.

Long story short, not only was the water cold enough to shock my body into an unresponsive state and the impact ruptured the soles of my shoes (broken blood vessels under my feet where the cracks were), but I later found out the point we'd leapt from was 85-95ft *and* locally notorious for killing more than a couple idiots every year. 😅

I nearly drowned, and I've not done anything similar since. Hell, even watching OP's video made a little squeak escape me.

*edit*: Ok, so this kinda blew up unexpectedly, so here's some more details to give the whole picture of that ridiculous day and how it all went down. 

&#x200B;

>!I'd been living in the PacNW for about two months at the time, and the nine housemates were an impressive array of misfit-idealist from engineer grad w/ a stripper problem to our strictly vegan self-appointed den mother, so it didn't seem improbable to expect the most normal among them to be, well, normal-ish? This was the trip that'd disprove that assumption - and nobody died, either. Win/win. Said housemate (call him R) and his girlfriend (aka L) had planned a daytrip to hangout with his old BFF (aka D) and invited me along, so I was game to get out of the house and meet new people, see new things, et al.!<

>!Another red flag I'd missed that day was our crossing of an unlocked (?) but closed gate on a ranger trail, but who was counting? I was taking it all in as normal behavior for locals, if I'm being honest, and what's the worst that could happen after all? (yes, I know now) The views were absolutely stunning, and I'd never seen anything like it in my whole life, so I was sitting in complete silence in the back of the Volvo wagon: enraptured, mesmerized, high on paradise (believe it or not, no weed allowed - L was allergic). We even stopped at a bend in the river so I could climb down the 20-30' slope to get a pic to send back home and right when I got in position, a trio of wood ducks winged through the S in the river, right over my head and downstream. On my way back to the car, I noticed two brown bottles stuck in an eddy and missing labels, so I did my part and picked up the trash. Only then did I see that the caps were still firmly on, so the other three were baffled when I clambered back up the slope with two ice cold Mirror Ponds!!<

>!Onward, we eventually made it to the deserted ""swimmin' hole"", and D & R shucked down to their shorts to race to the water. I'd not brought trunks as it didn't occur to me we'd choose to go swimming in mid-November this far North, so I resigned myself to using more towels afterward to dry off. Problem solved, right? Anyhow, the ""only way across"" was to balance on the lip of the lowest waterfall (feet planted between river and rock so the flow wedged them in place), and it was so unbelievably cold just on my knees down that I nearly turned back the whole way across. Getting there, I'd then seen the glistening dark wall of rock slicked with drenched moss and algae slime that D & R were already climbing like a couple of jackass goats, so I did my Scout's best to follow them up, and didn't look down more than once (that once was enough to show me the boulders directly underneath that assured me of death were I to slip at all). I lost track of how long or high I was climbing, but I do remember wondering if I could actually make it to the top where the guys were. Eventually, I did, and they were waiting for me to grab a tree trunk and catch my breath, as the slope we were all standing on was so slanted that you had to latch onto a trunk to keep from sliding over the edge to your death.!<

>!From where I was standing (third suitable tree, back behind the other two), I couldn't see the opposite shore or the water, but I had a full view of these two hollerin' and amping each other up before D just simply took off and jumped into the sky. R looked back at me and said ""Don't think, just go! Before you get stuck up here!"", and then he was gone, too. I couldn't hear anything else from them after that, just the wind through the treetops and the waterfalls below, and the rising silent scream in my mind that I was never gonna make it. And, as the fear took hold of me, telling me that I could hike further up and maybe find a way down, I realized that my balance was off, that I was leaning more than before, and I looked down to see that I'd somehow lost my grip on the trunk. In reflex, I hopped into a clambering run, aimed for the other side of the river, and made it two whole leaping strides before my foot hit a root or rock or something and time seemed to slow to a stumble with me. I saw the cliff edge stop getting closer, and envisioned my death as I bounced over and onto the boulders below, so I simply jumped with all I had - from a few feet before the lip, and hoped it was enough.!<

>!The air whipping past and roaring my ears made me think of an eagle: that this is what they heard all the time, reigning supreme up in their wide open skies - and then I looked down. I could see it all. The car parked on the trail, the towel that L had spread on the overlarge river rocks to try and get comfy while us idiots flipped off Death together, and even D & R swimming to shore, safely out from underneath me. I also saw that I'd passed the rocks at the foot of the cliff, so that was a relief, but it was all rushing up to me so fast and I was still sprawled in the air like some egg cracked from its shell about to be scrambled across the pan below, and I flinched: I balled up and pulled all my limbs close, expecting the worst, but a saving thought raced through me, ""go in like a needle, THEN spread out"".!<

>!I don't remember hitting the water, I remember it gripping me like a massive, monstrous, and hungry force and I was the tiny, shocked bug caught in the churn, and staring into the maw. My muscles wouldn't move, I felt the denim of my jeans flattened in folds, trapped my legs together, and I was slicing down through that icy flow, away from the cold sunlight dancing on the surface. I raced through all the things I could think of that could save me, and came up with nothing. Not a thing, and I can still feel the inner chuckle of ""wellll, fuck."" as I realized this was it: this is how I go out, and I watched the sky drift off above me. It wasn't cold anymore somehow, and I wondered how that could be, what caused that, and then I felt my ankle hit the other one: my feet were free! I willed those fuckin' legs to kick so hard and frantically like they'd never do again, and I clawed that water between me and sky until I was coughing and crying and choking and roaring at my own stupid, Darwin-disappointing choices.!<

>!The other three were standing on the shore, watching me stumble and throw my legs through the water, across the rocks to them, and L was concerned for me - though D & R were laughing and asking me how I felt about my first cliff jump, baby bird. If I had the strength, I probably would've murdered them where they stood, but I just laid there limp and sputtering on the dodgeball-size rocks like a fish waiting to dry in the sun.!<

>!To my further idiocy, the next day I joined them in spelunking the Ape Caves, only to find that they'd decided to lie to us and take us down a shaft that was off-trail and off-limits. Though L was just as livid as I was at finding this out (when our flashlights' batteries began to flicker out \~1.5hrs down into the dark), I don't speak to any of them anymore, and haven't since that trip.!<

>!I'm alive now, though, and will be quite careful when I go skydiving for my first time later this year. :)!<",2019-02-13 00:25:12

As far as I know, all that matters is that I nearly died and it split my Chucks from heel to toe, but I hit the water fairly wisely and didn't incur any lasting injuries — aside from the compete lack of interest in an encore. 😉",2019-02-13 02:22:32

7le23w,"What is essentially life? Thought about it?
Life is a number, notable for bright impressionable moments.
Try to remember the day 18 October 2013: if this day was not the day of Your (or loved one) and if this day there was nothing bright and unusual and if You don't keep a diary where you write every day, it is likely that this day, October 18, 2013 will go into oblivion; in the case of his birthday, mainly remains only the bare date. And how many such days which do not remember?
Every time I make something unusual in life we acquire tab, exactly as in the book — a bookmark of that memorable day. Perhaps the date we missed, but the experience will stay with us for a long time. Just need to remember them often with loved ones.
Has been Alaska tour in Peru to fly, but the wallet have so far only 0,01614 BTC (hopefully in the future a large amount😎),and so ladies and gentlemen, it is possible after all to collect with the world on a hundred, five hundred stasek, from people's not to be, the more a person voluntarily gives this a pleasant feeling in my soul will remain. Here try😏

Calm and confident by clicking on the link ""translate"" to the address bitcoin wallet 1L7ktq2KF7RW5fQY4gXmAUjjeyYpvFbkej in your bitcoin wallet, you give me the tab, that day, when I sit on the floor of the gazebo in which to curl the breeze is calm and gentle around singing those same birds and the same shaman will be whistling the same tune all the same that will be reflected in my memory( and the Internet have information about Alaska tours, if interested)

It gives a super cool intense streaking effect, though, if you have a lot of greys. One of my friends threw red over her ~50% grey hair and the grey went super crazy red while the rest was a bit darker red, so it always looked like her hair was glowing in the sun. 😍 ",2019-03-09 16:00:24

10fdojq,"Yup, pretty much the same scenario with music technology. As much as I hate those shitty-yet-popular music artists, they don't make the technology's existence a bad thing. There are still the artists that either respectfully reject using them and still create compelling music, and there are others that use these new tools in incredibly innovative ways.

That said, I'm an early adopter. I'm fond of AI art for its own reasons, and I've had a great time learning about the technology while using it. And when a good music AI comes along, even though I'm a proud musician, I'm gonna be jumping on that opportunity on day 1 if it helps me make the music I want to make faster. The most interesting AI artists use AI as a smaller part of their full artistic process, if you ask me. I think the same will go for AI music.

I don't know if that Super-AI will ever exist. It's hard to imagine that Stable Diffusion-like technology would ever work well with a training set of nothing. But if you asked me a few years ago if a tech like Stable Diffusion would exist now, I'd have a hard time seeing it coming. Maybe it's closer than we think. 😬",2023-01-18 22:47:08

LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO🤣😂😅😂🤣😂😅😂🤣",2022-07-24 20:12:49
w6wsj1,"You'd use a blockchain (nothing to do with money grabs, I'll explain later on). Split the video into blovke and hash them, say, every Nth key frame or segment, and include the hash of the previous block in the current block. This means nobody can tamper with it but you can still break it up. Then you throw in some extra blocks that contain signatures from trusted parties, as proof of different things.

One of them might be the key from the security chip in your phone and maybe include the public keys of your various components and a timestamp - Samsung says that this bit of video was created on this specific Samsung phone. The camera chip might sign each frame, same with the audio, and you'd know it's from the right camera and mic as long as you trust Samsung. The GPS chip signs the location, and the camera software might mix in its own signatures too. You could have other hardware nearby sign stuff too, like what I was saying about the speed of light - a fast challenge/response can prove proximity to another device and the only way around it is to invent time travel.

You might want to self-sign using PGP, an OAuth provider like Google, Apple or Microsoft - obviously use accounts in different countries for maximum protection from spies. Yubikeys, your bank by NFC scanning a credit card, your SSH keys, a login to an HTTPS website or a personal certificate would also work - there's a lot of options. Your software can then say ""according to Twitter, this video was made by NSAGov"" in the same way that NSA can use Twitter to log in to other sites 😂

And here's the reason for the blockchain:

As the video is recorded you build a ""merkle tree"" of hashes of hashes of hashes. So the third block has `hash(hash(first) + hash(second))` and the 5th has `hash(hash(3rd) + hash(4th))`. Let's call them `h[1][0]` and `h[1][1]` to keep it readable. The 5th also has `hash(h[1][0] + h[1][1])`, which we can call `h[2][0]`, the 9th has `h[2][1]` and starts the next level by combining those; `h[3][0]`. This continues after every power of two blocks, so if you record for 100 years you'll need to store extra 32 hashes in each block.

So if I take that 100 year video stream and cut 1 second out of the middle, I can prove it's unaltered just by sharing parts of the merkle tree. Start at the top and drill down to the segment I cut out, rather than needing to share the hashes of 4 billion blocks plus my actual blocks, I share, uh, 64? Something like `2 * log2(count)` hashes anyway.

If we had deterministic encoding/transformations we could scale and encode using different options at the same time and store the hashes of those in the video, so anyone could reduce the video size or resolution later and have the same hashes. Without that you'd need to have them as multiple streams in the same original file and people can choose the ones they want to extract and share - pretty sure that's possible with mkv. It'd likely quadruple the size of the original though.

Or trusted software could store transformations of an original source and share the authenticity blocks and sign it; ""Adobe and David Song swear that if you take the middle 6 seconds of this video from NSAGov, zoom it, crop it, and save it using version 12 of After Effects, you'll get this output."" Join enough of this stuff together and you've got a copyright authorship chain in there too.

Most of this idea will need work to make it optimal, the geometry of it is likely wrong, but I think the general idea is secure against deep fakes and even evil governments. Someone who hacks my phone's manufacturer, Google, GitHub, Yandex, Baidu, my webserver, my yubikey, my bank and my carrier has earned the right to make deepfakes of me!",2022-07-25 03:20:46
w6wsj1,"As deepfake technology advances it will become increasingly more difficult to process the algorithms required to determine deepfakes. 

Currently those algorithms can't detect deepfake expressions, which is the technology this post is showcasing.

8j8fz3,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2018-05-14 10:17:38

7llynq,In germany they called it UFO. 😂😂😂😂😂😂,2017-12-23 10:58:08
7llynq,They actually have a very limited window to launch this shit so that they get it in the right orbit. That window of time is literally 1 second. Today it happened to be at about 5:30. If they hadn’t gotten everything on track and the rocket a second ready for launch today then they’d have had to wait for another time when the earths angle and location from launch allowed them to retry. I think it would have been about 15 minutes longer than the hour of today’s launch. The more you know. 🌈,2017-12-23 05:55:23

Fake nature is good too, heck even pictures of plants can be of some help, but deprive a person of green and no matter how you tend to any and all of their needs they get super depressed. 


The reason I find it fun is, we as humans are these insanely complex structures, we have brains that have developed to the point that we made languages and can think about ourselves and life in general and we can understand all these scientific processes, on an atomic scale as well as on the entire universe. But we need to have green leaves around us or else we’ll want to kill ourselves lol",2022-05-04 13:58:09

9bpd0n,"haha agreed. and was glad his US tour got cancelled. 

this part is totally just shit talking, but when i hung out with him while he taught a class in our studio last year... he skeeved me out so bad. i didn’t have anything real or solid to back it up, just lots of weird staring that made me uncomfortable, so i didn’t say anything at the time... but it’s nice to know my intuition was maybe right! 

not to mention his huuuuge ego and terrible teaching methods. not actually showing pottery to his students (made them be silent while he demos, wouldn’t answer questions), but blabbing about IG follower counts and all the women he has to supposedly bat away. 🙄",2018-08-31 14:58:25

d8tea9,"This is a-maze-ing 😮🤩

Hmm to those who don’t do mazes it seems to be expert difficulty 5/5stara

But to people who have done these sorts of puzzles it is probably around medium difficulty. 3/5stara

If you ignore the shock value of the intricacy of line work and logic your way through it, you could finish solving it in 1-2 hours easily enough.

If you let your eyes shock you with the remarkable attention to detail it took to draw this maze then you’ll probably need a few days to get over the shock.

Basically it is a maze 
It can be solved
It will be solved.

Don’t get caught up in the (remarkable)details
Or they will delay your success (in this case)

——

And apparently people didn’t see my second post so I have added it below. Where I apologized for being too frank and not clear enough that I really did enjoy the work the OP did, but nevertheless I apologize for sounding negative it wasn’t my intention. 
—————

My response to the OP A few minute after their reply to my comment.

“Not at all. It isn’t a waste.

I guess I was a little to frank with my explanation.

The details are remarkable.

I’m surprised it only took 1 week.

 I believe that 99% of people are going probably not figure it out.

But that 1% of people who do mazes religiously it will still take them a fair bit to get through it.

Seriously the maze is excellent, sorry that I didn’t explain that very well.

I myself would probably need a week or two in order to figure it out.


Like 99% of people will probably look at it and their brain will automatically deem it too difficult and thus make it 100x harder for themselves.

You did good, really good.

It isn’t just a maze but also a psychological destroyer of worlds!”",2019-09-24 22:22:49

7ajcr1,"To be fair  have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

119w9cu,"Sure! I used tons of tape. I carefully measure and lay down my tape and smooth it down with my fingernail. Then I apply a clear matte medium (I use Golden) to the edge of the tape. It acts as a clear adhesive to get an even tighter seal. Let that dry, then I paint my color. When the paint dries and I peel off the tape, it's usually really crispy. Occasionally I still get a few spots that bleed, but I just touch em up at the end.

And for the colors, I just make sure I get a nice water:paint ratio and use a min 3-4 coats. I use Golden heavy body acrylics.

119w9cu,"I used tons of painters tape. I carefully measure and lay down my tape and smooth it down with my fingernail. Then I apply a clear matte medium (I use Golden brand) to the edge of the tape. It acts as a clear adhesive to get an even tighter seal. Let that dry, then I paint my color. When the paint dries and I peel off the tape, it's usually really crispy. Occasionally I still get a few spots that bleed, but I just touch em up at the end.

Cheers! ✨",2023-02-23 16:50:24

rv6owl,"Well if the planet was coming that quickly I feel like we wouldn't see much of a gravity effect like that. If this were a duplicate of earth itself, it couldn't exert more force to even make people fly up off the ground until it is almost right about making contact. If it was SUPER dense then maybe the land would buckle and things like people and cars might drift up a bit, but at that travel speed there wouldn't be much more time to witness it.

I'm assuming by the time the outer atmospheres collide, the entire sky would probably ignite and be way too bright to discern anything, cooking us right before pulverization. Not sure if we would be alive before or after the wind also blasts us.

If the planet was approaching us in a death spiral instead, orbiting and slowly closing in (assuming it's a duplicate earth in mass), that's when we would see some real 50 Shades of Cray

EDIT: Looked at someone else's comment where they made a good point about how rather than the two planets fighting for control of say, the water or people on the surface, they would actually be weakening each others' hold on their own personal structure. So perhaps the initial danger would be coming from below our feet with heavy earthquakes. Not sure still though with how fast that other planet is coming 🤔",2022-01-04 02:11:42

Meaning, it's a stretch, but china is closer to physically witnessing how bad things are than the rest of the world. They can literally see the consequences of their actions from how bad the smog is. I said that maybe china is bad right now, but on a worldwide scale, the comet has not struck yet

When the first world countries start seriously panicking, then you'll know that the comet is about to strike. But if you're comfortably sitting here on reddit and not freaking out that you're about to die within the next year, then I would have to say that the comet isn't close to hitting us just yet. Lol

v15jbx,"What God thinks about Christians getting high or drunk. 

Obeying God's commandments brings blessings. Not doing so brings curses. See Deuteronomy 28. Jesus commands us to stay sober. 

1 Corinthians 6:19-20 King James Version
What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. 

1 Corinthians 3:17 King James Version
If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. 

1 Peter 5:8 King James Version
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

Jesus Christ can free you from your addictions. Scripture says whoever sins is a slave to sin. Jesus is a chain breaker. We have to hate the addiction and submit to God and resist the devil. We have to ask God to help us quit. We have to commit to being holy. Repent of your sins and pray for deliverance in Jesus' name. 🙏 

Marijuana and mind altering drugs open up portals in the demonic realm and give demons legal rights to you. Jesus didn't smoke marijuana, get high or drunk. Jesus warned us to be sober minded for the devil goes around seeking whom he may devour. Jesus said I did not give you a spirit of fear but of love power & a sound mind (sober mind). Whoever sins is a slave to sin. Jesus said the body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. He warned us not to defile it. 

Fasting and praying breaks strongholds that the devil has on us. Fill your hearts with God by studying and meditating on the word of God.",2022-05-31 12:38:00

During the Vietnam War, in the 1960s, the ""V sign"" was widely adopted by the counterculture as a symbol of peace.

🤔 he doesnt have to be deep. This isnt modern art.. its in public for all including kids to see

>little brother's opinions at the dinner table

So that’s annoying because your brother is naive and he’s saying things like that as if anyone there can do anything about it. 

If you agree with but somehow don’t like social criticism being displayed that just makes you a class-A bootlicker 👍 along with a massive baby",2018-08-06 22:35:48
951vso,"I’m sorry some of his work doesn’t appease your standards of depth.  His work is in your face and more powerful as a result. With only a 1 hour interview out there there isn’t much to judge him on aside from his countless pieces. 

Not being deep does not mean he’s easily understood. His pieces aren’t just in a bubble, they’re related to worldly concepts that most people do not understand. namely war, surveillance, and poverty. 

I’m not saying all his pieces are revolutionary. But his perspective had value and he’s very good at not getting caught.

bf1wth,"*Just because I don’t like tattoos does not make me a bad person.*

Good thing no one said that, then. You are a bad person for thinking that everyone else is an awful shit because they don’t live the life *you* think they should.

*I am not stopping him from getting a tattoo, am I? Hindering his freedom? Nope. Am I aloud to judge his decisions? Of course I am.*

Again, no one said you weren’t. But others are also *allowed to call you out for being a dick. “I’m glad I’m not you”, just because he got a tattoo you didn’t like? 😂 Overreact much? 

*If you believe that you do not judge people based on their decisions, then I don’t know what to tell you. Someone is a murderer? Don’t judge that person on their decisions? Where is the line?*
Right, because getting a tattoo and murdering someone is the same thing. Stop strawmanning, it’s embarrassing. 

*Objectively, I’m not a bad person. Seeing that you made that decision based on one post of mine is laughable.*

Not at all, Already explained why. Maybe re-read my last comment. 

*You’re offended by my opinion, but that doesn’t make me a bad person.*

Lol not offended sweetheart, just pointing out that you’re a shitheel for thinking the people of the world should act the way *you* think is acceptable.

People SO stupid that they can't grasp how insanely large our universe actually is.

For someone to call the SPEED OF LIGHT, 186,000 MILES PER SECOND, 

#SLOW?!

I mean, how the fuck does anyone even process a sentence that way? How do you take the fastest measurement of anything and compare that to distances that boggle the tiny, fragile human mind and call it slow...

Not to belittle OP, or anyone else who hasn't taken an intro Astronomy course, or had even the slightest thought about how big our universe actually is, but for real? We have smart phones and the internet, people. PLEASE, DO SOME RESEARCH. LOOK UP INTO THE NIGHT SKY. help yourself to knowledge, it's all around us.

May whatever God or almighty being you saps believe in bring you solace and comfort, but we're all doomed on this planet. Unless we figure out how to leave and reach Light Speed, there is nothing but Death on Earth due to our own selfish, ignorant behaviors and our willingness to use up every single resource until Mother Nature eliminates the problem: us.

rm8ein,"You get it, thanks for the explanation. Love hearing other's opinions on this. 

May be because I've been watching The Lion King every day for two weeks but I love the analogy Mufasa uses about the circle of life. When one being dies, it returns to the earth and becomes a source of food and energy for another. The end is the beginning and the beginning is the end. 

Humans have always tried to find ways to cope with this, creating gods and whatnot, and I've never understood why people can't just be comfortable with what we know, or don't know for that matter. I was unaware of not existing before I was born, I'll go back to that when I die. 

I suppose I understand why the other commenter thinks I'm being dark, but I'm a nihilist and more often than not, I'm very pessimistic. I love being alive, watching my son grow and learn things but we're all going to die. It's better to accept it for what it is and enjoy our meaningless lives while we're here. 

✌️",2021-12-22 23:15:46
rm8ein,"I know 😏

But in all seriousness, religion has destroyed our perception of dying. It's a fear tactic and I despise it. It is what it is, nothing you can do to change it. Embrace it and make the most out of life while you're here and die happy.",2021-12-22 23:22:01
rm8ein,"That's fine, I have no qualms about that at all. Although, I find overly optimistic people to be annoying at times because life isn't always pretty flowers and butterflies. 

""Leave it to the breeze, you be you and I'll be me."" 

Peace and happiness to you stranger. ✌️",2021-12-22 23:50:47

amzyfn,"Okay so this is a hard concept to wrap one’s head around but basically the wrong colors are in the right wrong places. Weird, I know.

[TL;DR at the bottom, and the six paragraphs before it are a slightly longer TL;DR]

Basically, digital cameras are really bad at *remembering what color looks like*. This is to say their photo sensors gather a cursory view of relations BETWEEN colors and then uses incredibly complicated algorithms to try to figure out what you’re taking a picture of and then adjust the white value accordingly. Let’s say you have a piece of orange paper, a piece of white paper, and a piece of blue paper. Map these on a spectrum of temperature:

<— 🔶 — — — ◻️ — — —🔷 —>

^(— = one temperature unit)

Orange and blue are each three temperature units (again, very simplified) from white, and they’re six units from each other. Our eyes already know what white looks like within our environment, so we look at these papers and see not only that they’re six temperature units apart but *also* that they’re each three units away from white. But if we point our phone camera at it, the camera will see that orange and blue are six units apart, but it has no innate sense of what white is. All it will see is a piece of paper and a piece of paper that’s six units colder. 

This principle is called white balance and is one of the most important principles in photography. Our eyes do it automatically, but digital cameras need to be told what white is. These days, it’s automatic: you take a photo of, say, a tree, your phone gauges the overall temperature values in the scene to the best of its ability and notices that it’s probably out under the very orange sun, and it slides the temperature down until true white = white. It helps if there’s an actual white object in view for the camera to “latch onto” during that process. 

Another effect of camera’s not knowing much about absolute color is that *color vibrance* is very much different from what our eyes see.

In the video above, the neon green projection on the door is probably extremely bright and likely similar in color to a newborn leaf when you look at it in real life. But when it goes through the camera and the hundreds of hidden algorithms therein, it comes out as a dull mint. Where did all the vibrance go? Well, any number of factors can contribute to colors not looking how they look in real life, but it essentially comes down to two big factors: saturation and contrast.

You see, poor white balance is something our eyes notice immediately, and we will instantly be repulsed by photos or videos where the white balance is purely mis-calibrated. Thus, no small amount of effort and attention go into making absolutely sure the white balance is absolutely perfect, and other colors tend to get thrown to the wayside. The camera is less concerned with understanding why that green is so bright than it is with looking at the wall next to it to get a sense of the white balance, so it plays the safe game: make the green boring. In most cases, that green won’t actually be neon, which has very high saturation (low saturation = black and white; high saturation = pollen allergy medicine ad) and contrast (how far apart the dark and light are in the scene. High contrast will have darker darks and lighter lights, whereas low contrast will have all light approaching a medium gray brightness), so your camera algorithm keeps the saturation and contrast comparatively low so that the image won’t look unnatural if it’s anything other than a neon light. 

Looking at color suppression gives you a good idea of what may be fake in the scene. You see what the camera did to the greenest green, so if you see a greener green, you know it’s fake. And if you see something that’s, for example, incredibly vibrant blue, you have good reason to doubt the realness of that blue given that a vibrant green was suppressed into mint so why would the blue be any different? This is why poorly photoshopped images with bad color correction on added elements just seem *off*. 

Taking ALL OF THIS into account, let me draw your attention to two details in the scene: the wall in the back of the room behind the door, and a red dot (fire alarm maybe?) in the same room.

The wall in the back appears to be white, but it appears more green based on how much of the green light is in the scene. This means that the camera was white balancing wrong, probably looking at the green circle on the floor and hoping that it’s white and then correcting the scene to make everything look more green to match the green circle. This wouldn’t have occurred if the green circle were fake, as the camera wouldn’t have been looking for it. 

The red panel in the room is an example of color suppression. If you notice that what is supposed to be a neon green has been suppressed into a mint green, then you can infer that other vibrant colors must have been suppressed to match. If there were a bowl of really shiny, saturated, delicious-looking oranges on the table inside, you would have reason to be skeptical of the dull mint green. But there isn’t a vibrant bowl of oranges— there’s a dull red panel. Dull. Fire alarms are not dull. The camera made a similar mistake on the panel that it made on the green lights, suggesting  that they’re both genuine or that one is a very attentive fake.

Of course, it’s possible that it is fake— that the video’s creator intricately knew the technology in the camera and manually added in some lights, color-corrected the wall to be wrong but true to what the camera would do in such a situation, and made the lights dull to match the red circle within the room.

It’s also possible that an incredibly successful Japanese video-game and toy company learned how to project a video onto an expensive door.

Side note: these are incredibly complicated topics that even I don’t understand fully, so some wild reductions and small leaps had to be made in the interest of simplicity. If you’re still curious, there’s plenty of material online about the drawbacks of digital cameras, check that out. 

TL;DR - Cameras are bad at understanding color, and VFX artists are bad at understanding that cameras are bad at understanding color, but the coloring on this door matches the drawbacks of digital cameras, making it real or a *very* good fake. ",2019-02-05 09:41:12

##**Trump claiming that black people are lazy, and that's their trait, full quote and source:**
>“Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”**[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/sunday/is-donald-trump-a-racist.html?_r=0)**

>""Trump eventually denied making those comments. But in 1997 in a Playboy interview, he conceded “the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.”[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/sunday/is-donald-trump-a-racist.html?_r=1)

##**And here is the direct quote by Trump about the that person's claims:**

>""Nobody has had worse things written about them than me,” Trump says. “And here I am. The stuff O'Donnell wrote about me is probably true. The guy’s a fucking loser. A fucking loser. I brought the guy in to work for me; it turns out he didn’t know that much about what he was doing. I think I met the guy two or three times total. And this guy goes off and writes a book about me, like he knows me! I understand it. He needs the money, so he uses my name to sell some books. But it must have been a lousy book because it didn’t sell any copies.”[Source](http://www.playboy.com/articles/the-art-of-the-donald)

##**Trump falsely claiming that immigrants commit more crimes, and mexicans coming here are rapist, druggies, and criminals, to quote him:**
>""When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

>“What can be simpler or more accurately stated? The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.”

###**Here are the facts:**
>""Data on immigrants and crime are incomplete, but a range of studies show there is no evidence immigrants commit more crimes than native-born Americans. In fact, first-generation immigrants are predisposed to lower crime rates than native-born Americans. (The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for restrictive immigration laws, has a detailed report showing the shortfalls of immigrant crime data.)

>Immigration and crime levels have had inverse trajectories since the 1990s: immigration has increased, while crime has decreased. Some experts say the influx of immigrants contributed to the decrease in crime rates, by increasing the denominator while not adding significantly to the numerator.""

##**He failed to distance himself from KKK grand wizard, David Duke, on Live TV after learning that he's supporting Trump. He even claimed that he doesn't know who David Duke is:**

>""But Trump, who claims to have the ""world’s greatest memory,"" seemed to have forgotten this by Feb. 28. When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked him about Duke, Trump claimed ignorance four times:

>""Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. okay? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know.

>""I don't know, did he endorse me or what's going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. …

>""I don't know any -- honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I have ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him.""

##**He's been endorsed by numerous racist/ Alt-right/ whatever you choose to call it, blogs and news organizations-if you can call em that, to quote one of his initial endorsers:**

>Founded in 2013 by a neo-Nazi named Andrew Anglin, The Daily Stormer is among the most prominent online gathering places for white nationalists and anti-Semites, with sections devoted to “The Jewish Problem” and “Race War.” Mr. Anglin, 31, explained that although he had some disagreements with him, Mr. Trump was the only candidate willing to speak the truth about Mexicans.

>“Trump is willing to say what most Americans think: It’s time to deport these people,” Mr. Anglin wrote. “He is also willing to call them out as criminal rapists, murderers and drug dealers.”

**[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/us/politics/donald-trump-white-identity.html?_r=0)**

*Let me ask you this, is endorsement by a bunch of racist pieces of shit enough to prove what the guy says and believes in makes a racist?* 

****

##**He's retweeted white supremacists, and tweeted false data that supports racist ideology:**

>""Last fall, he retweeted a graphic with fictitious crime statistics claiming that 81 percent of white homicide victims in 2015 were killed by blacks. (No such statistic was available for 2015 at the time; the actual figure for 2014 was 15 percent, according to the F.B.I.)""[Image of said tweet](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/F-Vvag7xPOFj81AxWrRYIcgWkxfI-XcskVw50Dw5lXTAYv8B5Agb3K1qcUbEFFIAsmss2-GyZCorvd0rguxRcKRLHisVxz5ISq6ZqWIBmanhvr_MW8aFzf18GKfH19h0adcE8Pvc)

###**To quote politifact:**
>""None of the numbers are supported by official sources. The figures on black-on-white homicides and white-on-white homicides are wildly inaccurate. And, as several news organizations quickly noted, the ""Crime Statistics Bureau"" doesn’t exist. We looked for that agency as well and the closest we found in San Francisco were a number of crime scene clean-up services.""

###**Here is a comparison of what Trump tweeted out with actual *Facts™*:**

>Interracial homicides

>While the image references 2015, the year is not over, and no official numbers have been released. The latest data comes from the FBI for 2014. This table contrasts Trump’s figures with the official ones.

8i0qco,"Sorry, but that's a common misconception. Cropping and zooming are geometrically equivalent. 

Try it yourself. Take a shot at 24mm then at 85mm while standing in the same spot. Crop the 24mm down to give the same fov as the 85mm shot and they will look identical (except reduced resolution), background compression and all.


The relative sizes of background and foreground objects is entirely a product of the *distance* of the observer. The focal length of the lens does not change the spatial relationships of objects in the frame.

> That’s why being close up with a wide angle lens looks different than being father away with a zoom or telephoto lens.

cjetvy,"I've only ever had good experiences and I think that is partially due to the fact that I only ever did acid with experienced acid takers in ideal situations until I myself was experienced. Definitely not something I'd ever want to go into blind. I once smoked shatter thinking it was just weed and that was enough to fuck me up, not knowing what to expect and not being prepared for it. I'd tried shatter before even. 

Acid has sometimes been a super uncomfortable experience for me. I once broke down in tears and bawled my eyes out to someone about all these past traumas I'd never told anyone about before. It would have been a horrible experience if they weren't themselves very experienced with the drug and had no judgement towards me over it. Several of my friends would later break down to me the first time trying it as well. I always tell my friends they should definitely not do it unless they 100% want to, or you're practically guaranteed a bad trip. And once you have a bad one I think it can permanently ruin it for you for sure because you can't separate your past experience - it's like drinking tequila after a really bad experience throwing up tequila.

I got more of the ""melting"" effect from mushrooms. I found mushrooms way scarier because it seems to be less predictable how high I will get. I always get the same amount of high for the same time on acid so it feel safer even though it lasts longer. I also had the same experience with not being able to look at myself in the mirror. I was worried how I was seeing myself was how other people were seeing me as well, and I thought I looked ugly. But people are usually too busy staring at inanimate objects to care what you look like 😂 I learned my lesson at a music festival that if you try to put makeup on while high on acid... You're gonna have a bad time 😂 Faces are weird enough as it is without all the shapeshifting business. I was suddenly aware of every tiny hair and spot on my face.",2019-07-30 01:37:27

It's so difficult to show just how sparkly they are! Some literally look like galaxies inside! Apart from some of the geometric turquoise cuts that come through, opals have to be my favourite, even if they are difficult to photograph!

q2htus,"I am “that guy”, and it would be tourism money, visas, etc. the reason is that I don’t feel it’s appropriate to go be a tourist in one part of a country while a genocide is happening in the other side of it. Just Bc me not going doesn’t stop it doesn’t mean that I’d feel right about going there. Vs my financial support of the US govt is just a fact of life, not an active choice I’m making,  I didn’t choose to be born here and even moving abroad wouldn’t exempt me from those taxes. So not really an adequate comparison, since going back to Hangzhou would be an active choice for a leisure trip. Hangzhou will be there when things are more improved with the govt, I can go later in life 🤷🏼‍♀️",2021-10-07 16:54:54

8nxz0l,"Okay WOW 😮 I’ve always done these by adjusting the focus on my eyes, not sure how to explain it but you know how you can stare at something and blur your vision? Or when you squint to see something far away, it’s not your eyelids squinting that makes it clearer it’s your eyes focusing. So I will stare at these and try to blur my vision then slowly clear it like my glaze is going deeper or more shallow (this is hard to explain) you know how when you’re trying to get a close-up photo of something with your phone and it’s really blurry until you slowly pull your phone away and then it focuses?  I feel like that’s what I’m doing with my eyes but I don’t have to move my head a way to do it so that does help make a tiny bit easier. 

First I easily saw the one 3D butterfly with the flat background. Then I read about 3 butterflies in the comments?! So I played with the focus pulling back and forth with my glazes til I saw the 3 butterflies stacked in the center. Wow. Vision is such a trippy sense. ",2018-06-02 17:08:53

Some people don’t find out about their BAVs until later in life. I am in my early 30s and mine was just an incidental finding.

I can't think of a single rescue worker I know that would want to deal with your body after an incident, and I imagine your mother probably wouldn't want to either. The aftermath of jumpers (or in your case, accidentally falling) is not something pretty that you can just put in a coffin and cry over later, believe me. Your pics are cool and unique I guess, however, last I checked a human life was worth a great deal more than a bit of adrenaline and some fake internet points. The basic safety equipment you'd need would be a couple hundred bucks, so maybe consider investing in your life and the lives of all the others you're putting at risk 👍",2021-05-03 16:35:55

u56swn,">Source? 


Common sense should be enough to understand the adverse impact of foreign chemicals (DEET, deodorants, lotions, etc) into delicately balanced ecosystems; but if it makes you happy to know, my sources are: 1) I've lived my whole life  in one of the few places in the world where it's dinoflagellates glow as bright as those in the video. 2) I'm very well versed in the marine biology of tropical regions.  3) I studied eukaryotic protists as part of my university degree.


>Dinoflagellates are not endangered. 

And where exactly did I say that they were? SoURcEeE pLeEzZz!??🙄

Mind you, the problem isn't about being endangered or not; the problem is that these locations, as soon as they become impacted by heavy tourism, they start experiencing noticeable dwindling of their local dinoflagellate colonies -and as a result, they start taking protective measures; like forbidding people from swimming in these ecosystems. 

As soon as you start carelessly exploiting an ecosystem, you throw the balance off; and trigger a chain reaction of events that are seemingly too complicated for you to comprehend and accept, it seems.  

In short, the chemical reaction  that these eukaryotic protists use toproduce light is EXTREMELY pH dependent; therefore, any foreign substance in the ecosystem (like the floating pools of oils and DEET that the swarms of tourists visiting an ecosystem on kayak excursions leave behind after a swim) does alter the water's pH, and as a result eventually kills the eukaryotic protists at a faster rate than what they can reproduce at.  



>They do produce toxins which can make filter feeders toxic to humans and other animals. Some people are exceptionally sensitive to dinoflagellate toxins and do report irritation from exposure.

Which toxins? ""Luciferase""? It is an enzyme, not a toxin. 
Sure, dinoflagellate-eating ""filter-feeders"" can be toxic to **some** humans --in the same way that shrimp are too, or peanuts, or nuts, or lactose, etc.  

The fact that **some** people are allergic to them, in the same way that **some** people are exceptionally sensitive to peanuts, **DOES NOT** mean that they're toxic/venomous/poisonous; it just means that **you** are intolerant/sensitive to them; BIG difference! 

Tldr;
It's much easier to falsely tell people that they're toxic so that people actually stay away from the waters and don't kill these delicate organisms, that it is to educate them about why conservation is important - and about why people should care about protecting these fragile colonies and ecosystems.",2022-04-17 09:09:28
