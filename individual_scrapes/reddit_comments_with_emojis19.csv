But this is *literally* Nazi shit. We know it's happening, we know it's targeting a religious minority (Muslims instead of Jews this time) and nobody in power is really doing anything about it. 🤷‍♂️

We still buy shit made there. In fact we NEED Chinas production capability to maintain cheap products and overall logistics solutions. 

I guess because they're not trying to take over the world militarily it's just a ""domestic issue""? 🙄

Across from the funeral home is the elementary school, and on the days of the wake and procession, you could see a big red paper heart with the words ""We love you Mr. Bill"" written across. It was such a kind gesture.

j5vp4k,"Ah.

Fighting for air. Aren't yah, Donny boy. 

This fake China disease. It could never stop you. Masks are for the weak. It is just a flu. Don't look weak in front of your party of holy radicals. They abhor weakness. They want you to broadcast power. By any means necessary.

Draw a breath.

Stand proud. 

This disease is eating your system. Look dignified. Be brave. You avoided the military because you are smart. Weak are the people that blindly serve. You are a leader. You are strong.

Draw another breath. Maybe you should have skipped that fourth cheeseburger from McDonalds yesterday. And the day before. And the day before. Draw another breath.

You could have endorsed Trump masks©. But you wanted strength. You could have endorsed masks and made millions. Billions. But that is not how you work. You drive profit into a black sucking hole that farts out failure. 

Breath.

ecfiqc,"There’s literally no evidence the driveway wasn’t salted. In fact it looks like it was, and refroze. Do people think salt keeps ice away all the way down to 0 k?

Edit: Ignore the salty comments below 😂. This is how it actually works from an earlier comment:


This can easily happen after salting, and the flatness of the ice layer makes it more likely that it did. The ice melts only when the temperature is just below freezing. So you salt your driveway, watch the ice melt, and then hope the water evaporates before the temperature dips again. However, sometimes the temp goes down too fast, and the water refreezes before it evaporates. Then you can get flat sheets of ice ice like this.",2019-12-18 18:51:20

1.rape is a huge problem in india.
2.she was raped and disemboweled and died.
3.you reference rupees in your handle and defend a rapist (do you read the times of india site? the btl commentariat is very revealing).

ergo, i made an educated supposition from the information provided. don't stress mate. your record for being incorrect is still perfect. 😉🤣

lulz, i am bame, a woman, a mother of a daughter and a son, and i never raped anyone. so i can't be a racist, or be any worse than the dead rapist formerly known as kobe bryant.

you're very defensive, and not very good at search engine use. get educated, enroll in anger management classes, read more, try harder, do better. ta. perhaps you should change your handle to @sarinotsari 😉

dhubor,"Real news is boring and slow and even today some places don’t have reliable footage, even if they did have it, I think most 24 hour stations wouldn’t show it if it was too “distasteful” (read: reality) they’d get angry phone calls about “the children,” and some such nonsense. 

So the weird reality of it is that most of the world is mundane, and even really big stories will not look flashy, so they’ll cling to stuff like those to make people pay attention. And since it’s out there, it drowns out reality, since it’s much more fun to watch flashy stuff that reinforces what you believe. 🤷‍♂️ I mean hell. Even combat footage you can find online is “boring” by mainstream news standards and after Vietnam, I’m convinced they just refuse to show stuff where you can actually tell what’s going on. This looked like a movie so they must have been like “oh cool, it looks flashy AND people don’t have to see the reality of bodies. Put it on air! Is it real? Who cares!”",2019-10-14 21:40:04

That's what a lot of liberals believe, yes. Not many people know about the arsonists


>, like global warming just manifested fire out of no where, just poof suddenly everything burst into flames?


It's hard to believe, but yes, liberals are that dumb


>How the fires started has never been the concern.

It very much is a concern. You're not concerned with people starting massive bush fires?!

> The problem is how quickly the fires spread and grew out of control. 

Yeah, that's what fires do in Australia bush 


>That is what is caused by global warming

No, lol that's just what fire has always done

> If average temperatures were a little lower


Australia has always had Savage fire that killed many people. This is nothing new



 
>Fires are going to start

Yes because people are setting the fires


> there is nothing we can do to stop

We could stop people from setting the fires 🤷‍♂️


> pollution from human activity. 

Ok go tell China and India


> Humans may or may not survive

Humans will 100% survive, as we have survived every other doomsday global warming projection



> Eventually we will either die off

You guys and your crazy doomsday theories

bcesjp,"That was really brave considering I have seen puppy run over by a car, it's scary and sad as hell. I love dogs and have 2 dogs, one is Lab Retriever and other is a husky.  My Lab had the tendency to always run outside when the door was open (too much energy and excitement) and my husky always followed him (thinking he found something to eat).
so I had to train them both. They are really great dogs so it wasn't hard at all to train them. Now when the door opens they just stand on the boundary and stay there until I call them. I always reward them for this behavior. I love my dogs, they are one of the best things happened to the mankind. I would hate if anything wrong happened to them.
 I suggest training your dog and start when they are puppies. Even if only for 10 -15 mins everyday since that training will benefit both, you and your dog.

And when I met him it was at an internship. Lots of people and lots of new faces you don't interact with often, so the situation arrived a couple of times while we worked there. I guess you could say the situation happened more times than he can count on his hands 😉 

And it's not like people were being mean to him. No one actually made it a big deal, he would just say this to break the initial awkwardness.

Though it's true that one day I saw him being sad about his hand. He said he had just met a girl with a small hand that could put her whole hand in a Pringles box too. Kinda broke the magic for him.",2018-01-29 17:21:17

I took the payout and bought a Sawzall and an impact driver, cut off the non important bits, replaced the important bits, and bought a second Jeep with what was left over. They didn't even bother sending in the title info that it was totalled so I was still able to keep it fully street legal 😎

gyt2uu,"Whilst not 100% confirmed to be the single cause, a strong correlation between darker skin and vitamin D deficiency speaks volumes when you consider that it in itself is responsible for 10% of gene expression.

Black lives matter, they certainly do, but please if you are going to actively protest in scenarios where social distancing is simply not possible,  consider the increased risk of more black lives being lost due to the spread of coronavirus.

Whether you are protesting or not, I'd urge anyone of darker skin to take a vitamin d3 supplement (preferably with K2 in too).  And at the very least do some simple research into it.

Last thing I want to see from all of this is yet more deaths, especially when factoring in the increased risk (often 3-4x increased fatality rate) on the people it is intended to protect and fight for.

Yours in solidarity,

iikw64,"An absolute hero in the film industry.  It’s surprising to hear of his passing, but it’s mind-blowing to me what he was able to accomplish over the last 5 years.  

Take time to think about the impact this man’s presence in film has had for little boys and girls of all colors over the last decade.  The roles this man has played - Jackie Robinson, James Brown, Thurgood Marshall, THE BLACK PANTHER!  Really inspiring just to think of the roles he chose to play.

Now, take a second to realize that this man had Stage III Colon Cancer for the last 4-5 years.  During the entirety of his tenure as the King of Wakanda, he must have endured agonizing treatments and procedures for a chance to cure or at least slow his disease.  Never once was this even leaked to public knowledge.  Meanwhile, he dedicated himself to his craft and to be a role model for a younger generation.  This man truly was a superhero.  RIP.

iikw64,"I woke up at 4am to a text from my boyfriend telling me Chadwick Boseman passed. I had to look it up for myself because I just couldn’t believe it. 

I remember a few months back seeing his face all over the Internet along with articles saying fans were concerned for the actor after seeing pictures of him looking extremely frail. 

There were so many people cracking jokes and making fun of him. Others, like myself, were speculating that he was preparing for a role... I mean he is an actor after all. 

Looking back, this deeply saddens me. I can’t even imagine how seeing some of the nasty, rude comments people left may have made he, or his wife and loved ones feel, knowing he was suffering. 

It just shows that famous or not, we never truly know what a person is going through. 

Humanity needs to be more kind. ❤️

R.I.P to a strong black man, who silently fought his battle and still managed to find the strength to give us his all. 

The man who through many of his roles inspired little black boys, and little black girls everywhere. 

The man who was our black Superhero. ❤️❤️",2020-08-29 08:44:11

fvelxh,"[I’ve made many more videos like this](https://www.instagram.com/kevinlustgarten/), glad you like this one!

Steps:
- Shoot 2 videos: road, and wakeboarding (preferably at a similar time of the day so the lightings match).
- Stabilize both videos to make them easier to work with.
- Mask out the “blue” of the water in the wakebording video, and adjust the settings until it looks good enough.
- Mask out everything but the guy and the water splashes (this is dibe frame by frame).
- Animate the guy’s position to avoid the cars and stuff.
- Correct the color on both videos until they line up.
- Use the original wakeboarding layer (animated) as a displacement map to slightly distort the road video and make it look wavy/watery.
- Add back some camera shake.
- Post it on Instagram and get some hate by people who think it’s real 😂

EDIT: fixed some wording and added a link to my work.",2020-04-05 15:20:33

While I never had it as bad as you, I did have a pretty bad few years of recurrent mononeuritis multiplex (caused by an autoimmune vasculitis disorder attacking the blood vessels to my nerves) that left various limbs paralyzed for different amounts of time. I can very distinctly remember when the worst of those happened it was also in my right arm, and every day I would try to lift my wrist or do a thumbs up just hoping one day something would happen. Then one day it finally did and I almost didn’t believe it at first, but I realized I could very slightly move my wrist. Then the next day a little more and so on and it was like the best feeling in the world.. so I am so happy for you man and I can only hope your recovery continues! ☺️",2021-08-13 20:16:53

7b18ae,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Jimmy Neutron. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Carl's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Ultra Lord literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Jimmy Neutron truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Godard's existencial catchphrase ""Bark bark bark"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Jimmy's VR epic Lamapalooza-I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jimmy Neutron's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Jimmy Neutron tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",2017-11-06 06:14:02

90bmjv,"One of my best friends has 15 farmer markets over Saturday and Sunday that equals 35 contractors that man the stands.  A little deviation is expected week to week but there's a minimum that you come back with if you sell x amount of product.  I came in to help him audit the markets and identified 2 possible points of loss.  I showed up to each market and worked as a new hire. the first market I go to the chick takes her phone out of her pocket and I shit you not, a bunch of loose 20's comes tumbling out all wadded up.  She looks at me and proceeds to tell me ""o don't worry the owners are idiots they don't care, take up to $200"" 

Edit: to finish the story 

Most of the marketers are friends of the owners or like myself have a 9-5 and do it to help a friend out.  This young thief was the daughter of one of the partners friends.  I called my buddy and explained my findings.   30 min later I get a text and it's the girls mom saying she is on the way along with dad in the car.  I met them in the parking lot along with my friend and explained the situation.  The mom and dad walk over to the stand and she greets them with a hug and smile, when she sees my friend round the corner that smile turns to the most beautiful frowny face and I think everything finally clicked in her head.  The mom makes her flip her pockets out and theres the 💰.  She scrambles to pick it up like a stripper grabbing her ones after her stage time is done.  The next few moments were just sad, her movements resembled a broken robot on TV her brain must've been misfiring because it looked like she was having a seizure trying to process and come up with a explanation.  Without missing a beat mom slaps her straight across the face and with a backhand on the reset.  They apologise profusely and begged my friend to not call the police and that they would handle it when they got home. 

A few days later the parents cut the farm a check for 10000.  I don't know what happened at home but when I over heard the dad saying this was the most shameful thing she had ever done and ""you will pay for this when we get home"" I knew nothing good would be waiting for her at the end of the car ride.  She also got a unpaid position for a year every weekend  at the farm digging holes, turning the compost pile, refilling the workers water jugs and my favorite, cleaning out the storage shed.  Let me tell you about the storage shed, there are some mean looking spiders and a whole lot of nooks and crannies that I wouldnt poke a stick into.  She had to clear it out, catalog and make it useable.",2018-07-20 06:04:09

I’m sitting on the toilet, and I look to see her holding it in her mouth and having to half toss it in the air while she walked with it towards me. Dropped it at my feet.

6ko9yg,"It’s depends on the woman for instance a muscle avulsion or partial avulsion can happen to the levator ani muscle and once that happens it cannot go back unfortunately. You can strengthen the surrounding muscles and in turn get stronger pelvic floor. This is actually way more common the anyone wants to admit and can and usually does lead to prolapse of pelvic organs (yay) also severe tearing can lead to that or incontinence (no not just at 70 years old even at the ripe age of 25, it just depends on the woman) vaginal birth can be great and easy peasy but for many of us it can cause injuries that last a long time and change things down there. Sex isn’t affected too much in fact that’s the last of my worries but once you have prolapse you have to be careful doing certain activities like weight lifting running, high impact things etc. which is so hard when your young with small children and still have your whole life to live. But they don’t tell us there dangers of vaginal or natural birth they only warn us about c sections when both should be explained to us by our doctors so we can make the best decision. Looking back I wish I had a c section due to the mental and physical problems having to not even big babies have caused me :( however there are so many complications that can come with that also. So who knows 🤷‍♀️ 
Moral of the story childbirth in all of it’s forms is nothing to sneeze about. It’s a major major thing and our bodies can recover great and sometimes not. But one thing I learned is all women who have given birth are fucking amazing, strong and resilient as hell.",2023-01-11 21:49:45

They are a celebration to learn more about the mysterious nameless bump in the mommy's belly that you will raise for the next 20 years and will accompany you the rest of your life. Let people be happy, don't be creepy about it, this is a juvenile way to behave.

As progressives say about gay marriage and abortions: if you don't like them, don't have one. Otherwise keep your opinion to yourself.

> a celebration of the norms the parents intend to force on their child until they're old enough to make choices for themselves

Over 99% of the entire population is cis. Giving your child a dumbass gender neutral Woke™ upbringing and letting them decide their gender for themselves when they can't even decide their own bedtime is a recipe for dysphoria.

xwmbeg,"In the Italian-speaking countries happens the same! 🫠
The n.1 political opposition to the far right party (which has won the elections a few weeks ago...) bases most of its electoral campaign on some ""Well at least we are not as bad as the far right!""; ""We are the good guys, when compared to them!"" shit. A few days ago I saw a video of two young women protesting the limited options to abortion we have. There are regions in which you can't find A SINGLE doctor that will perform an abortion, and to obtain the medicine that will allow you to do so, you have to spend some money. These two things let you understand that, when taking into consideration a rich woman and a young girl with limited means, one of them has it easier when it comes to have access to abortion. A politician from the party I mentioned went to talk to them, probably expecting praise, since she comes from the ""good guys"" party. The two young women shredded her, reminding her that her party did virtually nothing while the access to abortion was gradually reduced. The politician left, angrily telling them ""Well I really want to see what the OTHER party will do for your abortion issues!"" 
I mean... Saying that someone is worse than you is not like actually showing that you are good...",2022-10-06 09:01:06

Don't forget to do your breathing/affirmation exercises in the meantime. Try to bring your pulse down so you can clarify your state of mental wellness to the best of your ability.

I wish you the best of luck maintaining the stability of your mental well-being. 

I can't do any more than express my sincerest wish for your long path to recovery and prosperity, because I'm pretty much focused on life. I doubt you can relate, but that's okay.

xwmbeg,">even though it would provide massively more power without exhausting any CO2 into the atmosphere.

Ah yes. The typical nuclear power propaganda. ""Green energy without any CO2 emissions"". Nobody cares that you need to mine uranium to make nuclear power plants work and that refining this uranium means that nuclear power plants have ongoing CO2 emission all the time.

And the other lies are here as well.

>Green Power is not nearly efficient enough to provide large cities of power.

Notice how he won't give a citation for that. He just wants you to trust his word that green power is shit and can't provide energy for anything. Unlike Daddy Nuclear Power Plant 🥵

5xcx63,"Videos are ""motion pictures"" yes like the company Motion pictures. Shot in frames, movies are usually 24 FPS (frames per second) basically in lames term 24 pictures in a second. 

A helicopter's main rotor blade operates in a lift off procedure around 600-700 RPMS (depending on what kind of heli it is)  

So if a a Heli is running at 600 RPMS and a camera is shooting at 24 FPS we can say that 600rpms X 60 (sec/min) = 

36000 \ (24 X 🍰pie) = .002 ms 

Every .002 ms a camera snaps a shot while the rotor makes 1 complete 360^degrees turn

So, what national league do you play in, considering your chance of getting to the NHL is between 0.16% and 0.4%, depending a bit on where you start.

Oh and to be eligible for the Player's Pension (play 400+ games)? That chance is at a fat 0.02% roughly. ",2018-12-01 00:13:47

Thank you all so much she is completely overwhelmed by the response and is grinning from ear to ear! You've made an ~~old~~ young lady super happy!

The craft fair is something we've been encouraging her to do for years because we all know that the cards she makes are so cool, but she has been reluctant because it's kinda scary for her. 

Also wanna say that she does this stuff as a hobby, not for $$. She doesn't have a business or a website or anything right now and making these cards can be super time consuming so keeping them in stock would be a big issue. 

Again, thank you sooooo much! This is why I love reddit!

I actually hadn’t downvoted your initial comment. I merely answered your question, at least up until the comment when you started behaving like a complete twat simply because you were deeply offended by my explanation that the video was old/reposted/poor example. How dare someone not love the same video as you, and offer an explanation of what’s wrong with the video, uh? 

The amount of people who upvote a perceived “cool video” doesn’t make your comments any less ridiculous. The most hilarious part is to see you pretending I got “hurt” by your childish insults, despite the fact that you’re the only one here behaving like a child throwing a tantrum. “Toughen up buttercup” and all that was particularly hilarious considering your behavior. 😂

Thanks for the laughs, I guess at least you’re entertaining. ",2018-01-24 00:08:32

I hope you have more than just basic projection in your trolling toolbox. It’s funny now because it’s so hilariously absurd and transparent, but it gets boring if it’s just that.

We had a much younger tabernacle building go up in flames in Provo Utah several years ago. I was getting off work at 4am when I saw the fire and went to go watch the firefighters put it out. The building was wall-to-wall, top-to-bottom, engulfed in flames. The roof was a complete loss but the brick exterior was salvaged.

The LDS church turned the building from a tabernacle into a temple. Literally the only remaining original details are the exterior bricks. It’s fascinating how they restored it. 

I’m curious to see how this roof will be restored.

If anyone is curious to see the destruction and restoration of the building in Provo, here’s some links:

Interestingly, one painting was mostly scorched... but in the middle, [Christ was spared from the flames.](https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/heraldextra.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/0d/c0d1ef60-0c7a-11e0-aa3c-001cc4c03286/4d0fc190ca1a8.image.jpg) As far as I know, literally everything else inside was completely gone.

It hurts to see a historical landmark burn. But it will be whole again. ♥️",2019-04-16 02:39:19

bdjb2k,"On April Fool's day last year, the Canadian independent electronic dance music record called Monstercat released a song on their Youtube channel titled ""Crab Rave"" by Noisestorm. The song was meant to be a joke; the music video featured animated crabs dancing on an island (all animated by Noisestorm using Unreal Engine 4), and Monstercat was temporarily renamed as Monstercrab on it's subreddit and wikia. 

For a few months, the song remained at a few hundred thousands views, like most Monstercat songs did. 

Until the memes came.

People started using a clip from the video of a dancing crab, bass boosted the music, and overlaid the video with their meme texts. You'll probably find lots of them on Youtube now.

But anyway, that's the story.

I would comb your past post and give you an idea but i just don’t have the time for it. I am too busy living life. All politics aside, maybe you should seek counseling if it truly bothers you.

q7y8hh,"I'm shocked at the lack of condiment sag.

I suppose the bread can't collapse because of  crystalline internal structure and the negative pressure ""vacuum-not vacuum"" supporting it. 

Are there any liquids at the bottom? 

How do you handle the object to protect against shock and vibration? Is it stored upright at will times? 

Do you store it in motion, or is it stored in  a display? Is it stored away from UV? Do you have a seismic protection plan? 

Maybe it needs a gyro safe case. So it can never ""topple"" 

Is it insured? 


I think I remember you saying the object changed shape due to gas pressure. Do you have measurements for change? Has it stabilized? 

Can we get close ups of the birthday dog?

Was this culinary delight the last meal prepared by a special someone who passed right after so it was preserved in epoxy? Will they think that it was a novelty for amusement or a seriously conserved item destined greater things? Will someone device to free the did from its clear encasement to see if it was food or to see if it was a lifeform? Think if all of the epoxy encased bugs that are sold as roadside trinkets?

8za7v9,"A year after my brain injury, I got a puppy.  Training her and taking care of her was apart of my therapy.  She knows when I'm having a panic attack or when I have brain fatigue and need to sleep for 12 hours even when she was only a few months old she would lay with me for hours and lick my hands when I couldn't bring myself to get up. Shes my velcro dog always next to me. But shes not a ""service dog"" persay.   What animals can do and the bonds we have with them is amazing.  ❤ ",2018-07-16 15:30:30
8za7v9,"I got a dog for my 20th birthday with my abusive ex. She is incredible. She has always stood by my side. She knew he could hurt her if she was in any way vicious to him, so she just sat close to me after the abuse. I think it was so bad it scared even her because she would hide in the bathtub when he would scream at me and throw things, and she knew eventually that’s where I would go. Thankfully I got rid of my ex but I still have my sweet Lily. My current boyfriend is much much better, I see no abusive red flags from him and so we both have gotten much more comfortable. Since we found out I am expecting, she always lays by my side of the bed or at the foot closest to me. She is so sweet and says good morning to everyone in the house, and she is my angel. The interesting thing is that she is and has not ever been trained to be a service dog, but she is always drawn to people in emotional distress, like my brother in law who has a lot of emotional issues, or my grandmother who hates dogs but is incredibly emotionally distressed and shows it through anger/frustration. I’m sure that Lily’s smile is the sweetest puppy smile I have ever seen, and this post made me think of how much I am lucky to have found a sweet girl like her to keep with me until her dying day ♥️ ",2018-07-16 16:30:07

8za7v9,I love this. I’ve never understood how much an animal can help calm a panic attack until I had one myself in the middle of the night (side effect from a medication).  My cat sleeps with me so I grabbed him and buried my face in his fur. It took a while but I eventually calmed down and he didn’t even mind that much. Animals are the best ❤️,2018-07-16 16:18:23

8za7v9,"You realize Hyperventilating is literally not being able to breathe right? 😂 
And just like allergies, taking a pill doesn’t simply get rid of the panic attack. It’s not a cure all for the panic attacks. Also, if you’re so damn worried about it, you can move seats if you’re allergic to dogs. Moving seats won’t stop the panic attacks. So you’re right, comparing the two is ridiculous, allergies are easier to control. 

Also, it’s coming from someone who suffers from both. So I think i’d know. ",2018-07-16 17:51:18

I went to a Danzig concert years ago. I got separated from my friend in the pit and a few guys noticed and told me not to worry, they'd keep me safe. They made sort of a wall around me and were totally awesome. 

At another show, when we were getting ready to leave, my brother checked something in his engine. There was no issue, but he had the hood up. Every single car that drove by stopped and asked if we needed help or a ride.

9z39e6,"Holy shit. I just went through a huge nostalgia trip, both through the OP gif and your comment.

I pretty much lived in my primary school library in my first few years of education - this is around 1996-1998. Loved rockets, loved cars and space, loved the future. Poured over the outdated, late 80s-early 90s non fiction books they had, illustrating what future Mars colonies, moon colonies, cities and the rest would look like.

One of the things about the gif that made me do a triple take was that one of these books described (and had concept drawings too!) of the electric cars of the future.

They'd refuel by pulling up and getting their batteries swapped out, but their concept artist had them push the fresh battery in from one side of the car and the used ones would pop out on the opposite side.

The kicker? They were expecting this kind of thing to be in place by *1997*.

Good to know we're 20 years late, I guess. 🤷‍♂️ ",2018-11-21 16:38:39

a6fvr3,"I used to go to house parties at this chicks place who did this. She would say “house rules” and just cheat. It took all the fun out of it. She lived, with three roommates, in a six bed mansion that was in the middle of town.  It used to belong to a frat who had their charter revoked, it was a nice place and she was willing to host hella parties.

Anyways, one party around Ceasar Chavez day in my senior year, the party started and just got out of control. She was clearly blacked out, but still on her feet and acting like she was the queen of everyone and everything.  

Given the day, we had started very early. And as it went on more people showed up with more booze. My buddy and I, on the promise of free booze for a 16 hour timeframe had agreed to stay relatively sober. (Meaning that we agreed to stay upright enough to go buy more booze and exchange empty kegs. We also made sure that people who showed up chipped in some cash.) 

ANYWAYS, around 8PM, my buddy and I are walking from the liquor store to the house with a keg. We come in and they’re playing beer pong out back. Our lovely hostess 🤢 is shitfaced and running the table like a chimp on crack. 

She and her friend (also a class act) were playing these two dudes who were regular staples of this chick’s parties they were clearly throwing the game and flirting pretty hard. After 20 minutes two cups on both sides had been cleared and people around were starting to get pissed.

Another 10, maybe 15, minutes goes by and these guys who we had never met tell the chick and her friend to go drink some water and chill.  Hostess gets belligerent and talks back.  Without another word, both guys look at each other and then pick up the hostess and her friend. They put them in a closet and sit up against the door. 

They’re intimidating dudes and on a normal weekend they would have been put out, but because of the day no one really gave it a second thought. After 10 minutes of them being in the equivalent of adult timeout, they women stop beating on the door and the guys leave. 

Five minutes or so later the two come out. Their mascara is running from them crying and the party is clearly about to take a downward turn.

After that, she was more respectful of her guests. So I guess there’s an upside.  My buddy saw one of the dudes a month later or so and asked him some questions. I guess the only thing he said was, “Sometimes people don’t know how to be good to their guests. Sometimes people gotta be taught how to do that.”",2018-12-16 03:45:14

gq10uj,"On the subject of Donald J. Trump and his laziness and lack of consideration for others, I have a story to share.

The following story was told to my parents a few years ago (prior to the presidential election) by a respected acquaintance who went to boarding school with Trump when they were teenagers.

(Having looked up Trump's education on Wikipedia, I believe the school being referred to was the New York Military Academy - located in Cornwall NY, about 60 miles north of NYC).

It was normal for many of the boarding students to go home on long weekends and schools breaks. While many or most of the students (including the original storyteller) would usually get picked up by their parents or take the bus, young Donald was typically whisked back to the city in a chauffeured limo sent by his father, wealthy real-estate developer Frederick Trump.

Only this one time, something happened to the limo before it arrived at the Academy and it was unable to get there. Evidently, someone rang the school and asked if there was anyone still there who might be able to offer Donald a ride back to the city. 

Although our original storyteller wasn't by any means 'friends' with the young Donald, they did share at least one class together. And after all other possible options had been exhausted, Donald (or perhaps someone from the Academy, I don't recall) ended up asking him if he'd be able to help out.

Being the nice guy that our storyteller is, he said ""Of course!"", knowing that his parents wouldn't object when they arrived in their spacious family car. In fact, he thought the hour-plus car ride together would be a good opportunity for him to get to better know Donald. Maybe he could use the opportunity to learn a thing or two, and perhaps, he thought, on the next school break Donald might return the favor and he'd get to ride in his limo.

So our storyteller's parents soon arrived, and he quickly made introductions on Donald's behalf and explained the situation. Of course his parents were thrilled to learn they'd be 'chauffeuring' the son of a tycoon back to the city. The dad puts Donald's expensive luggage in the trunk, Donald got in, and off they went.

The entire trip, Donald did not speak unless first spoken to. He gave short, absolute minimum answers to any and all questions asked of him and didn't even have the common courtesy to feign interest or make small talk enquiries about the lives/interests/activities of our storyteller or his family.

He did, however, provide good directions to his father's place. Once they arrived at the destination, Donald got out and waited on the sidewalk for his luggage to be taken from the trunk. Then, to everyone's absolute astonishment, he simply took it and walked to the front door of the building, went in, and disappeared.


**He hadn't even said 'thank you'**.

And, apparently, he never did at any later time. Nor did he ever offer to return the favor, in any way, shape, or form.

ah1kka,"I think C.S. Lewis said it best.

""Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.""

Everyone would leave to visit their families during breaks which I couldn't do since I was an international student and the whole town would be dead silent. Combine that with the impossibly high tuition my parents were paying and the workload, lack of friends, shit roommates, the cold nights (-40C).... In hindsight I probably shouldn't have went there in the first place. Queen's was my first choice and I guess I had to give it a shot. At least the people were nice.

8qw7ra,"It’s funny how these arguments develop. It’s easy for us to think that the most deadly/dangerous are the biggest & the meanest. 

You know what the truly terrifying predators are? It’s the wee little venomous ones that leave you slowly over the course of many gruesome hours. 

I’d take a bear’s charge or the tiger’s leap over a bite/sting that leaves you conscious through a long period of cruel, paralyzing pain🤖.

eldygb,"*Important edit: Thanks so much for the awards, it really does mean a lot to me.  I don't want to sound ungrateful, but I can't think of a polite way to ask you to please send that money to the [wildlife rescues](https://www.zoo.org.ay/fire-fund/) instead.  Y'all are so nice and I love you, but I don't need awards and the people trying to save the animals need help.  I'm just giving the coins straight back to the original commenter anyway, since I hijacked his comment.  So donate to those who need it or give it to him!*  

Very, very sorry to hijack, but beyond donating, Australian wildlife need custom-made pouches!  If you or anyone you know can sew, knit, or crochet, [PLEASE pass on this info.](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/QGQT3Mh)

I'm on my fifth knitted wildlife pouch, and I'll be shipping them on January 20th.  Since shipping to Aus is expensive, if you wanna pop something in the mail to Colorado (much cheaper in the US) I'll put your contribution in with mine and ship the lot.  Just ~~PM me and we'll put together a big ol care package~~ [subscribe here for shipping instructions to Colorado](https://www.reddit.com/r/Boy_Am_I_Over_My_Head/comments/elo4g6/i_dont_know_what_im_doing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).  ♥️

Edit 1: From u/fraerie:

>Jumping onto this - if you don't feel able to help by sewing or knitting/crocheting - there are call outs for materials - preferrably 100% cotton (less flammable and irritating to the skin of the animals).

>I donated a couple of garbage bags of old sheets/pillow cases/tea towels the other day. If you don't have the time to sew, maybe pop into spotlight and pick up some cotton material and donate it, or get some wool/yarn for the knitters. The same group can let you know where to drop materials ([https://rescuedpets.com.au/drop-off-locations/#?sort=random](https://rescuedpets.com.au/drop-off-locations/#?sort=random)).

>Thank you to everyone who is helping.

>Friends of the Zoo (Victoria) is also doing a fundraising drive to raise money to provide medical support for animals injured or displaced during the fires. [https://www.zoo.org.au/fire-fund/](https://www.zoo.org.au/fire-fund/)

Edit 2: I'm not a charity, nor associated with any charities.  I don't want money (I mean, I *do* want money, but I don't want money that should be going to help wildlife; I still have to sleep at night).  I didn't even make that imgur album, I just wanted to spread the word.  I'm a regular lady with two jobs.  I just like animals.  If you're not the craftsy type, please [donate to the wildlife and the people who are working 100 hour weeks to save them!](https://www.zoo.org.au/fire-fund/)

Edit 3: There seems to be some disagreement about whether shipping this stuff internationally is of any help.  There don't seem to be any sources that the actual charities are declining international shipments ([and the comment from the Real Live Aussie says otherwise](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/eldygb/an_australian_family_set_about_rescuing_as_many/fdi0ep7?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)), so I'm gonna go ahead and send my stuff.  **But if you're planning on buying a bunch of supplies for this, your money would definitely be better spent [donating to the wildlife rescues directly.](https://www.zoo.org.au/fire-fund/)  I agree that donated money is faster, easier, and more efficient.** I don't have much money, but I have a lot of yarn and the skill to use it.   I'm just using scrap yarn that I already had sitting around.  Just want everyone to be informed.  [This is the link I was given.](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/ek7205/the_animal_rescue_collective_craft_guild/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)  The user who apparently started this (or is just spreading it) admits their source is some unnamed Reddit mod, and couldn't provide any sources for the information besides that.  I'm genuinely not interested in arguing about it either way.  Send money if you can.  UPDATE: THERE IS NOTHING ON THE CHARITY'S FB PAGE THAT DISCOURAGES INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS.  I had to wade through the disaster that is FB to learn this.  The page says they will be needing all of these items for several months.  This rumor seems to be people passing off their opinions as fact, and it honestly makes me really sad.  [Don't do that shit when it comes to important stuff, guys.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Boy_Am_I_Over_My_Head/comments/elp6g7/charities_are_not_discouraging_international/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Edit 4: [Updated list of what they need most.](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/pVwheaL)

Edit 5: I was genuinely not expecting this much interest, and I only have so much money for a shipment.  I'm going to take the wonderful advice on getting in touch with my postmaster and everything for the folks that have already contacted me, but if you still want in on a shipment please contact one of the [folks who are running the official US drop sites here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dxcqQnZGY4Io3mQNID7MhlgOrvCEP1rhWSeesBUIOtg/mobilebasic?fbclid=IwAR1rbd-Edd6cKTT0wlsvLlCIT-C0m0ICT_pIjX53nzrT4Ah15bguCWiariI) or the [Canadian ones here.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/659914731079141/?ref=share)  

Edit 6: Oh please whatever gods there are help me.  They took down the goddamn google doc, so I guess I'm the official US dropoff at the moment by default.  If it's between you not sending stuff to the critters due to shipping costs, or sending stuff to me so I can ship it, let's do this thing.  I made a subreddit.  I didn't intend this to get so big.  [Please lookie here, if you would, and we'll get this figured out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Boy_Am_I_Over_My_Head?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Naturally I decided to prise it open and was immediately greeted by a shocked man sitting on the toilet.

91c5bk,"It wasn’t on the highway, but this happened to me today. I’m behind a green minivan as we approach a red light at an intersection with a left turn lane, a through lane, and a right turn lane. The green van hesitantly veers toward the center lane, and I stay behind it needing to go forward myself. Of course, the light turns green and they throw on their right-turn signal, staying put while waiting for the 5-6 cars in the right turn lane to clear out so they can go and I’m stuck behind them because their dumb ass must block traffic rather than turn right at the next block. I normally reserve honking for drivers who almost cause an accident but for this- I mean, I had the time- I laid on the horn to indicate that that shit is ridiculous. This was in my neighborhood so I knew that the signal wasn’t the longest-lasting, adding to my irritation. And they will probably do the same thing the next time they decide not to get into the lane meant for exactly what they need to do 🙄",2018-07-24 02:19:51
91c5bk,"Unfortunately, yes. I think further investigation would show this motorcyclist was arrested for harassment and inciting violence. There was no reason for him to act the way he did. From what little context we see here, i gotta take the side of the SUV driver. This guy was just trying to drive and some edgelord is trying to ""push him back"" because he wanted cutsies. play stupid games , win stupid prizes.

Edit : Removed the offending part of my comment , my apologies 🙄 this biker was still being a major tool though , sorry not sorry

Edit : Guys what's with the hate, we don't even know much of the story here. This SUV driver could have been on his way to save a life, do you feel proud for harassing a fellow Redditer?

7gognz,"Earlier this year my boyfriend and I attended a party at an apartment clubhouse with our two dogs. We were having a good time when we realized the dogs were not in the room. The door that led to other parts of the clubhouse had been propped open and they had run into the gym area where someone had left the window wide open. Everything after that is a blur, we both climbed straight out the window and immediately started yelling for them (sorry neighbors). We got one the dogs right away, she just ran up to the first person she saw lol. Our Aussie is much more nervous and got spooked, we saw him running along a busy road for a brief moment but at that point there were a lot of our friends chasing after him and I was screaming his name, I think it was all just too much for him. It was incredible to see my friends spring into action to help us and even strangers were stopping in their cars to see if they could help. We gave up around 2 am, it was too dark to see. We went back out at 7 am, drive around the whole area again then went on foot for a couple hours. Eventually we heard him barking behind some houses, we just KNEW it was him and his voice. A man was kind enough to let my boyfriend in his backyard, he was hiding under the neighbors porch with their two dogs. Luckily he just had some worn out paw pads, but those hours not knowing where he was were excruciating. I know exactly how the man in the gif felt getting his dog back, I am SO happy they were reunited ❤️",2017-12-01 02:12:31

Hi Reddit, 👽 here. As an Alien I know a lot of weird science facts and physics not yet known to your species. Don't worry. I always keep it... Human. 

First of all, the illusion has something to do with what's called the [Albedo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo) index of the freshly fallen snow. You see, the higher the Albedo percentage, the more reflective the surface is. Freshly fallen snow has an Albedo somewhere between 70-80%. This highly reflective surface, in conjunction with just the right angle of solar reflection from the surface, time of day and angle of the shot made it perfect for reflecting the majority of the incident lighting coming from the sky. The ban across it's surface even appears to be the horizon. 

Due to [Atmospheric optics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_optics) the frequency of the light need only be blue shifted, as is custom of higher altitudes where the Ray's are refracted through ice crystals at the time of day that is apparent in the GIF from the magnitude of sunlight candescence. This is perfect for the snow to mimic, because they are in essence compact ice crystals. So the snow reflects the same blue hue of higher altitudes air, perfectly due to it's Albedo and it's undisturbed surface. 

We are then duped by the OP as they haul the pupper like a parachutist would do to a colleague or object. There seems to be a bit of [Ebbinghaus illusion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebbinghaus_illusion) occuring as well, as we only see a small fraction of the snow in the beginning segment of the gif, and it's undisturbed surface that extends beyond the lens would imply to us that it is indeed infinite like the skies further magnifying the effect. The person in the GIF is also wearing warm thick gloves frequently used in such videos by the jumper.

To top this all off is the word illusion used in the title (or the alluding to the snow being the sky). Which wasn't needed as I had fallen for it without reading the title and was shocked when he hit snow. 

I suppose I'll need to recalibrate my optics. Farewell humans 🛸

One of my favourite [weird] things to do is look at a room I am super familiar with upside down - usually by hanging my head off a couch in my living room or at my parent’s house. I did this recently (and more awkwardly) at a basketball arena I’ve been watching games at since I was 5. 

Also - looking at photos of yourself upside down, or laying in a face-to-face 69 with someone you know intimately. Have a conversation and study their expressions, mannerisms, etc, from that angle.

Made by Kenichi Sonoda, the same creator of the Bubble Gum Crisis series.

He also did Gunsmith Cats and Gall Force

Some of the best anime to come out of late 80s-early 90s

Edit: damn autocorrect,  Sonora-> Sonoda

Edit: thank you for destroying my inbox.
😀

Thank you for the rewards

I was lucky enough to have seen a lot of these before they came state side and subbed/dubbed. I was watching Ranma 1/2 and Rurouni Kenshin before they became popular here

I haven’t kept up with the new stuff, my kids are into the new anime now, but they are familiar with the classics..even the likes of Space Battleship Yamato and Galaxy Express 999. They have watched all of the Miyazaki library.

The last anime I’ve watched was Attack on Titan so if anyone does have any suggestions on good ones to stream..I am open.

Edit3: No Naruto...I couldn’t make it past the first 3 eps. My sister is in to it, I am not

Edit4: thanks again everyone. My inbox is overloaded. Keep Em coming, but I am a mom first so may not read every thing that comes in.

I was just lucky to have been introduced to anime back in the 70s as I can understand Japanese (can’t speak it unless you really want to hear an adult sound worse than a baby). My grandparents were first gen citizens, both sides from Japan and Okinawa originally, but I was raised in that culture all my life. Never really understood the difference between Japanese animation and Western Animation as to me it was all cartoons and I just had more than your normal person to watch because I got to enjoy both.",2021-03-01 18:25:26

 Anyway- one day, George came to class with really short hair. The Afro was gone.

 “George! What happened to your hair?!?”

 “I took a bath and when I got out, my hair looked like this!”

 😳

He didn’t laugh or even crack a smile, so I just assumed this was what happened to every black person if they got their hair wet- it’d shrink like cotton candy.

She also protects me, shepherds the cats for me, and keeps birds from nesting in our yard. She fetches things for me but they’re just things like her ball or her toys. She does some nose work but they’re more for entertainment than anything else. She’s trained on one scent only but we put that scent on tissue paper, stuff it in Easter eggs, and make her hunt for Easter eggs around the house and backyard. It’s actually pretty amazing to watch!

g9misd,"I know you're getting blown up with ""wE aRE noT AlL LIke tHaT"", but you are right.

No, it's not just about being an asshole - there are assholes everywhere. It's the attitude that their asshole behavior is constitutionally protected (even though it isn't).

I've lived in 5 countries and 3 continents. They all have assholes, they all have opinionated people, they all have loud people. All of the countries I lived in had relatively high baselines of all of those behaviors. But the American flavor has an even bigger degree of ""oomph"", and in my opinion it comes from a much greater focus on individualism, the (ignorant) interpretation that the 1st ammendment gives them the right to own and vocalize any and every opinion, and lastly a general (on average) lack of exposure to other cou tries.

abyxfz,"Yeah, my dog is one of those. I’ve had him since he was a few months old, and he’s 13 years old now... all around a GREAT pup, but sometimes another dog (usually puppies and specific breeds like Pits) will just trigger an aggressive reaction in him. And unleashed dogs running up to us are the worst trigger, so I appreciate others keeping their dogs under control.

I don’t necessarily mind if they’re unleashed, but ONLY if the owner has full voice control & is paying attention. Don’t just yell “he’s friendly” as you stare at your phone, people. 🙄",2019-01-03 08:46:25

bflrcf,"I have a black lab beagle mix and I've never once met a dog so obsessed with food.

She loves to act like we're starving her even though she's fat as fuck. She's pretty old now so she doesn't like to do much but snooze and hang out, but if she hears you touching food in the kitchen she'll zoom her old ass over there as fast as she can in hopes of getting scraps. She also loves to bully my yorkie into giving her food, n always licks the bowl after my yorkie is done eating 🙄

Also the only time she's ever nipped or seriously growled is when food is involved. Less so now that her food bowl isn't kept in her kennel, but if u tried to take a bone away from her she still would not be very happy",2019-04-21 16:08:01

That being said, alcohol is a terrible drug just like the rest of them, and I’d advise everyone reading this to stick to things that come out of the ground, unprocessed. Weed/opium/mushrooms, lol. 💜",2020-01-06 00:30:42
ekg4bh,"No point arguing with these type of people. 
At the end of the day, you are ending an organisms life to benefit your own. That’s it. However when you eat a plant, you are literally doing the exact same thing. If their argument is that it can’t feel pain then would killing cows and pigs in painless ways justify the meat industry? 

Plants: 
An external action occurs, a responsive mechanism happens in response 

Fights and acts in order to survive 
(Seeks food, territory, evades/protects from predators) 

People:
An external action occurs, a responsive mechanism happens in response 

Fights and acts in order to survive (seeks food, territory, evades/protects from predators) 

This means that plants are aware of its environment through senses. Like other animals. They just have different ways of doing so. 

“For example, despite lacking eyes, plants such as Arabidopsis possess at least 11 types of photoreceptor, compared to our measly four. This means that, in a way, their vision is more complex than ours. Plants have different priorities, and their sensory systems reflect this.”

A life is a life and vegans are mass murderers along with omnivores.

Either way they are ending a life so the moral high ground really doesn’t exist. Unless they claim that their life ending practices are better than the other sides life ending practices which makes no sense. So unless someone can survive on air and water then we are all killers. The only ground they really have is suffering. But again if we killed them quick enough to even register pain then where’s the suffering? If they are treated well on the farm then will it be okay to eat meat? A lot of them will still say no... I know you are not the one who is arguing for  veganism  but I thought you might like this POV. Also I don’t even want to start a conversation with the other person, it will go no where 😂",2020-01-06 00:20:27

As a teenager I started to need glasses for distance, my mum always used to hand me jars and cooking instructions to read the (small print) label to her, or else she’d hold it really far from her face. I noticed my Dad never did, he just took off his glasses. 

My ma eventually reached the point where her arms weren’t long enough and she’d have to *swap* glasses for close reading. I used to find it kind of funny.

To which Donnie replies, ""Yeah, a little too quiet."" They come across 2 Foot Soldiers pacing/patrolling and Donatello jumps between them, gets their attention and they are knocked out quickly. Donnie says ""That was easy."" And one replies ""Yeah, a little too easy."" Then they come across Raph, tied to a pole. One says ""Look, it's Raph"" and Michelangelo says ""Yeah, a little _too_ Raph"" and gets slapped by the others. When they go to free him, they are pulled up into a huge net. Dialogue ensues and, I believe, that is when they first meet Tokka and Rahzar. 

It's been several years since I've watched it, but that is what I remember from the hundreds of times that I did watch it between 1991 and 1995. Also, Vanilla Ice.

anrdtf,"Ha! That couldn’t be further from the truth. Who told you the RCMP was beating natives out of their homes!? 🤣 Shit is always taken out of context. Under the treaty act(s) the Canadian government can revoke the specific rights of said natives to their treaty land if in need. 

Not that this is relevant, but the First Nations people were given access and specific rights to their land after European colonization. That’s a pretty generous thing the government did compared to the genocide of natives in the United States. I think you’re talking about the protesters that were blocking Trans-Canada worker’s access to their place of work. The police had every right to break up their unproductive protest wall. 

The police in Canada do not serve businesses, they serve the government and their designated communities. You’d rather report to many biased stooges than one guy? I don’t see how that’s completely relevant, but ok. The reconciliation of the native people will never be over, they’ll always want more and to continue to reap their benefits from just existing.",2019-02-06 22:47:22

Bilal was so sad that he had to throw away his Pizza... but smells like teen spirit came on and we moshed about it until it was time to go...

We show up and the 5 of us pile out and walk into her house and she cried she was so happy.  ""for the first time I didn't have to wait for yall to get here"" then we all got back in the van to go for snow cones and [""I Believe in a Thing Called Love""](https://youtu.be/sRYNYb30nxU) came on on the CD my brother had brought (his girl friend had mixed the CD for him) my grandma who I had never seen dance started danceing to it.

ax152t,"Wow! I used to work at McDonalds, not gonna lie I would have LOVED if a dog came at me through the window. It was literally my dream because I saw so many pets working in drive-thru it always made me happy. On slow times I also used to watch the birds that were usually nearby. If that happened to me I would have been so flipping excited.

I always wanted to give the doggies treats when I worked on drive thru and even bought a package of doggie treats but I wouldn’t dare ask my GM. 😔 I couldn’t just give them either because another coworker would have seen me and probably told on me. ",2019-03-04 17:32:06

ax152t,"My mini dachshund is hooked on the timbits.

He thankfully toned down the screaming but he still cries in excitement every time we drive near a Tim Hortons.

The one nearby me, one of the full time workers knows him now and she loves him.  It is pretty funny watching him balance on my thigh with his eyeballs bugging out while he focuses on that little bag.

If they don't give them over fast enough he starts to make his horrible hound noises so the workers know they have displeased him. 😂

I think the craftsmanship is excellent but something 😑displeases😑 me. Not in the same way that most ""trypophobia"" imagery does, though. Usually those patterns evoke feelings of visceral malaise, like they remind me of a disease or infection or something. This just makes me vaguely unhappy. Like when a hanging painting is only slightly crooked, enough to make you think is it crooked? Is it the shape of the frame? *Are the walls crooked*?

I work with cownose rays and they are usually pretty playful anyway, but if I'm away for a long weekend or off sick for more than a few days Dougie, the big one, zooms over immediately as soon as I get back in the tank and starts flapping all over me. It makes my day and while cownose rays may not need a huge amount of space, manta rays do.

All the animals we have are non migratory - I'd hate to think of how mantas, which often roam over ocean areas as large as 220km, feel about being cooped up in a tank.

Edit, source: https://www.facebook.com/thedodosite/videos/1578146122320057/
Second Edit: This is starting to get some attention. *PLEASE* consider donating to a wildlife charity this year. The work they do is so incredibly crucial and they need all the support they can get. If anyone wants, please feel free to DM me and I can provide you with the places I normally donate to.

EDIT 3: I'm starting to get a lot of DMs about donating (ya'll rock!!). Here's the list I've been sending to people who message me:

1. The African Wildlife Foundation is incredible and does some fantastic work. They're well established and definitely deserve the love they get. In terms of making sure that the money has the biggest impact - this is a sure bet. 84% of their overall amount goes to providing services. Link: https://www.awf.org/ 

2. The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is one of my favorite charities in the world. They help raise baby elephants (and a couple of rhinos and giraffes), provide water to animals during droughts, have anti-poaching teams, provide vet services to wild animals etc. They're just lovely. And you can ""foster"" an elephant. And like the one above, they're excellent in terms of operating expenses vs what goes into charity - 92.5% of their funds go directly into helping with conservation Link: https://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org. 

3. More targeted, but The Amboseli Elephant Research Project is great in terms of research on elephants. Link: https://www.elephanttrust.org

4. The Wildlife Conservation Network is also great. Something nice about them - 91.3% of their funding goes straight into helping with conservation as well. Link: https://wildnet.org/

5. The Animal Welfare Institute - they're also fantastic. 94% of their funding goes straight into their programs. Link: https://awionline.org/

6. One final plug - the Ol Pejeta Conservancy (which helped keep Sudan, the last male Northern White Rhino) could also use some love. https://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/support-our-programmes/

I hope this helps!! I especially adore DSWT, they're a phenomenal organization with a lot of heart.

It’s gonna take a lot of work, because honestly, right now? Shit is out of control in the U.S. and it might be too late to fix. It will take two generations just to get rid of all of Trumps lifetime appointments to the judiciary. 

Still, I hate it when people on the left start bitching about something someone inherently on ‘our’ side did or said... it’s like, ok, they did something wrong let’s make it a teachable moment, recognize that they are still *trying* to do the right things, and move on to the more serious offenders, please.

c7ix0o,"Exactly, I've never bought any animal from a breeder; I've always had my share of volunteers. But yeah, if you really need a hypoallergenic cat, it would be a fluke if you stumble upon one at a shelter. Whenever a pure-bred cat showed up at the shelter where I volunteered, it was guaranteed to be adopted in one or two days. No matter what it's personality was like, someone wanted it just because it was an expensive breed. (What's funny is that I'm terribly allergic to cats and dogs, but I've always had them anyway because I'm a little crazy! 😉)",2019-07-01 03:01:26

It's just that in the engineering world, cast iron and ductility are two words that don't usually go together.  I spent a career in both the manufacturing world and the welding world.  Had our in house labs do hundreds of metallurgical tests including the common ASTM tensile tests.  Generally, cast iron will have minimal percent elongation and brittle modes of fracture.  There are exceptions- ductile cast alloys and post cast heat treatments.  I've run across some customers who called ductile cast alloys out on drawings, but they were very rare.",2020-08-20 19:41:02

When I was around 30, one of my friends had a big party at his parents' house because they had a great yard.  I'd been quite the little stoner but by then it was just a once-a-while thing for me.

At one point I was chatting with my friend's Dad, who I met the first time that day, but knew he was a regular smoker.  As we're talking, he sparks a jay -- no surprise -- and after a bit passes it to me.

I felt like it would only be polite to accept.

Later my friend and his main pals were like, ""He NEVER shares his weed!""  ""He NEVER shares with us!""  So damn I was really glad I made the right choice!  And I felt honored.  😂

Well one day a guy tries to steal some shit from us. At the time, i was just arriving at work to start my shift, so im parking. The security guard runs past the till manager (Kjetil is his name) shouting that the guy has stolen some stuff. Kjetil jumps the counter and sprints out of the door. He quickly catches up the the security guard, and takes up pursuit of the lithuanian thief. 

I see this guy, who is a bit out of shape desperatly try to escape, by running up a snowbank thats buildt up from the snow thats been plowed over the past months. He crests and stumbles down. Kjetil races up, abd jumps at him. I come scrambling up, and find Kjetil has the poor guy in a chokehold, whispering; Just relax, just relax.. Go to sleep now.. 

And he did.. 😐 then after a while, the police came, greeted Kjetil as an old collegue, and take the poor dude away...

96bnsl,"I absolutely love and adore ferrets. If you get them young and treat them well, they will grow up extremely loving. Mine used to give me ferret kisses and run and jump around while chasing me and squeaking. Tips from an owner of multiple ferrets. 1) some ferret farms have questionable operating procedures and you should look into the background of any ferret you are interested in. 2) They can be potty trained, but even so tend to poop in any available corner. They poop a lot! 3) They are also very active and need a large cage along with plenty of play time. Since they are so long, they can literally fit into any hole they can get their face into. Watch out for any gaps at the bottom of cabinets, furniture, doorways ect. They will sneak through! 4) They are also really easy to step on or close the door on if you aren't paying attention while they are out ( no ferrets harmed in my care)  5) be careful choosing litter as cat litter is bad for their health. 😁 If you have any other questions or concerns Feel free to message me! Owning ferrets takes work but it was such an enjoyable experience. I will always miss and love them!",2018-08-11 01:27:45

If the ref judges that it was on purpose, there are two penalties on that play. The first guy for throwing the stick, and the other guy for playing with an illegally obtained stick. Seen this happened a few times in my days, actually..

Although, I guess this particular play here can be viewed as accidental by the refs, as in he tried to push the stick aside and, by luck , it ended up in the other guy's hands.",2019-03-04 13:10:23

dsjp8l,"probably already been said in 60k responses but yes a camera auto adjusting the shutter speed to compensate for exposure will record footage with frame intervals differing to the base fps of the video file - thus making your wiggle jiggle 😎👍🏻

for example at 25fps you need to be using 1/50 shutter to mathc the feame rate. If the shutter speed differs mathmatically then you get artifacts like rolling shutter or wiggly rulers where the speed of frames being offered to the chcip is different timing to the frames being recorded by said chip.

Why would their having a property dispute matter when they were close friends and Trump praised him before their property dispute?

>Doesnt matter that he never flew on the plane but bill did 26 times

If that were true it might matter. But Trump [did fly on his plane](https://www-insider-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.insider.com/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-flight-logs-unsealed-2019-8?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&amp&usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=15943873373433&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insider.com%2Fdonald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-flight-logs-unsealed-2019-8)

>Nevermind the weird blue dress painting of bc on the couch found in his house

That's weird alright. Of Epstein. I don't know why you think it reflects on anyone but him. 

>Nevermind trumps open hatred of child predators

😂🤣😂🤣 You actually buy that, after he literally praised Epstein for looking his girls young, sexualized his daughter from birth, and has a history of going after young girls himself, including barging into the dressing room at his pageant, where underage girls were in various states of undress?

>Nevermind trumps open hatred of child predators and the drastic spike in pedo rings getting blown up since he was president.

Operation Broken Heart began under Obama. Just because Trump became president doesn't mean he's responsible for the outcome of work that began in the previous administration. 

>everything the guy has done for the past 25 years.

How could something that was taken within that same time period go agaisnt what he was doing at the time?

Edit: And just to be clear, anyone involved with Epstein and his fucked up abuse of children should be taken down. If Clinton did things, fuuuuuck 'em. If Trump did things, fuuuuuck him too.",2020-07-10 13:30:22

Giant ugly beasts who mostly kept their distance. Slowly they were replaced with Canadian seagulls, who are much nicer to look at... and much more mindless and ballsy. Giant swarms swooping down and devouring a single fry. 

...but about a decade or so ago, the pigeons came. Those little flying rats don't soar around looking for food. They just walk right between your legs and grab at shit still in your hand. They're also mean little bastards who chase every other bird away. So now all the pretty birds are (mostly) gone and it's just endless lanes of pigeon traffic walking the boardwalk like an all-you-can-eat buffet... and we're the plates.

For those who only know shittymorph from (in my opinion hilarious comments-I crack up every time I fall for it..), he's also an awesome person who used his own time, energy and love on a rescue that desperately needed a hero. My heart is full and breaks for you at the same time as I know what goes into gaining that trust back then to lose her 💔. Feel free to reach out if you need a bud. That's a great picture...frame that and remember

9wglnu,"We don’t get any rain from typically early May until Halloween.  Forecast says no rain for the month of November. So everything gets really dry. This time of year though is especially dangerous because we get Santa Ana winds. Usually the wind goes from the ocean heading east. It keeps the weather nice and cool at night even when it’s hot. Makes for lots of fog that keep the redwoods happy. The Santa Ana winds are strong and come from the desert going westward. They are hot and dry. 

Keep in mind everything is so dry that fires can start just by tall dead meadow grasses blowing against each other in the wind. Or by chuckleheads throwing cigarettes out of their car, or by PG&E not doing maintenance on their lines and the lines spark during windy weather. 🤨  

nearly thirty years ago a similar thing happened in the Oakland foothills during Santa Ana winds created a firestorm and a bunch of people died trying to escape along the one narrow twisty road out and got caught in their cars.   Evacuate if they tell you to and do it early. ",2018-11-13 01:17:59

bt6gop,"In a parent's extreme grief of losing a child, they all react and need different things. When photography was invented, pictures of the dead were one of the first things to come from it. 

A last memento of our loved ones at death is important. Why have a headstone? Why do anything besides get a dump truck to come pick up the body of our loved ones? 

Why judge the decisions of others when you should just feel empathy?

Just wanted to remind everyone that this complete stranger you're totally ripping to shreds actually exists and is hearing some of your garbage fat jokes. Since the post went viral, she's deleted her facebook. Her family members have linked posts of the video shared by various pages to her fiancé's wall (and presumably hers, before it was deleted), and the comments on those posts are much the same as these.

One acquaintance's response: It's a real shame you have to deal with all these nasty comments in what should be a happy time for you two.

I'd love to see photos of all of you in your thirties, and ten months after your second child. Nobody is saying you *can't* say it. Go ahead. But that doesn't make you or your Just a Joke™ any less shitty and mean. Some people need to take a long, hard look at themselves in the mirror and consider why they think fat jokes are the *pinnacle* of entertainment.",2017-10-22 00:41:24

Some people like just watching only the dropping and some people like the videos to have more personality from the people doing it. It's not really babbling so much as them just having fun with it. They could say nothing and drop things for 10 minutes straight, still getting that Youtube video length, but I'd say the video is a lot more fun this way.

Plus if you think about it, a lot of talking is useless banter but that's what makes it fun. If everything we said had to be informative and useful we'd probably talk less because it'd be tiring. Even then how useful is dropping things from heights and see what happens anyway, it's all mostly for fun it seems 😛",2019-08-24 13:35:54

To continue to be a part of the AZA, you must either move the animal to an accredited AZA institution that DOES meet enclosure size or increase the enclosure size of their enclosure to keep the animal if for some reason the next year’s policy changes.

srysnv,"Except its also Eminem lol. He's the dude that sneaks around and doesn't want to be as famous as he is. Him kneeling was him making a point. Its who he is. Why else would he stay there and cover his face? Why write songs about the injustices from every possible facet? Every community. From school shootings, no one (in the white people bracket) caring about rap until someone who appealed to middle America did it, to the Vegas shootings, dealing with abuse, drug addiction, having children and watching them deal with your mistakes, losing a friend to violence, being a part of that violence before, everything... he doesn't get on a stage without a message to convey. 

I'm definitely a Stan, but give the dude some credit. He knelt for a reason, he rapped lose yourself... the song that got fucked up the last time he did it live.. he never did that song live, and this was righting that wrong for sure. And with snoop? I wonder how snoop felt when the crowd literally went crazy for the dude he tried to say wasn't even in his top 5 or 10 or whatever. IMO he knelt to remind people that the injustices are not over.. and its more powerful when rap finally got recognized enough to do a halftime show. 

It had meaning, even if mine was wrong. Kneeling and covering your face on a huge stage isn't a signal, he would have just stood and covered his face or pointed at dre and said something about piano to pay homage to Eric. 🤷‍♂️",2022-02-14 03:51:54

My niece almost knocks me over every time I see her.  I'm incredibly lucky to be so good with kids.  No idea why they mind me like that.  Probably cuz I'm autistic.  I've always been kind and i show respect to kids which is all they really want.  We all remember being young and feeling no one respected us.  That's why I always show respect.  It earns respect in return most times.  Remember that kids are little adults who haven't grown to that point yet.  They want respect just like us.  Show them you take them seriously and they'll take you seriously.  It's not hard.❤️. And I just figured out why they mind so well!  I literally thought of it while writing this.  Thanks Reddit!

gfy6ys,"Cat Tail Science™ sort of mystifies me. Maybe I have an oddball furball, and I still notice common tail cues, such as the back and forth ""I'm annoyed"" motion. HOWEVER my cat never walks around with that Butthole Proud tail stance -  it's always about parallel to ground. I've always considered it rather polite.  

Before anyone thinks my cat is depressed or something, this is the most content, chill (lazy) cat I've ever known. 

So occasionally I wonder about what we really know about **(all)** cats and their tail positions. There are a lot of signals that are easy to figure out, but when it comes to my cat, a tail straight up in the air only happens when I scratch that certain spot on the back or when food is coming. 

Meanwhile I'll just be glad not to deal with much cat butt pride. Not that there's much to see through that thick Persian fur anyway. 🤭",2020-05-09 01:27:53

So all I was doing was answering the question that was posed, which was super general and not something like ""why would it be safer in this particular case?""

I could have definitely added something like ""but in this particular case any knife dull or sharp would be dangerous for this situation because of the fact that it is a potentially uncoordinated child wielding it,"" but that might have been over thinking it.

I’ve worked in the trades and most job sites (in Detroit) are like a high school gym class where the tough guys bully anyone who’s different. From what I hear, it was even worse for past generations of tradesmen. This guy probably wouldn’t have ever busted out a Micheal Jackson inspired dance session at lunch time because he would never hear the end of it. I can imagine gay jokes and most likely be compared to a woman. I’m not trying to bring negativity to an otherwise cool post, I just thought that pointing out the bullying and jock bro nature in the construction industry is lame and it’s pretty sad that some men think that being tough and a bully is a sign of masculinity. I think it’s cool and masculine to embrace your artistic talents and other guys should show support in sharing them.

h90v32,">	Is he doing anything illegal? So that gives them the right to detain him? So the only people the protestors need to appease is the international community rather than the people who they are living with? So my point is, in an actual democracy, don't minorities get a voice? If they win, what happens to the people who aren't yellow?

You seem all over the place. Firstly, you claimed “they didn’t even apologize to the reporter!”, to which I replied that the apology was never intended to be made to the reporter. Now you’re asking if it was right for him to be detained. He was a reporter for Chinese state media, sent to HK airport to act as an agent provocateur, to deliberately provoke people to beat him up. He even had a “I ❤️ HK” t-shirt in his backpack, the same kind worn by blue, pro-police/government thugs who attacked civilians just days ago. So yes, I would say he deserved to get his ass beaten. Hey that was the outcome he was looking for anyway, might as well indulge him. 

Like I said, no one has been attacked for simply being “not yellow”. If you think so, you may want to reassess your sources of news and information (which I’ll touch upon more when we get to the videos you shared). 

>	Have I said that blue ribbons should be allowed to attack innocent civilians? No parties should be allowed to attack civilians, and everyone who does needs to be held accountable, period. Including police and blue ribbons, and also yellow ribbons. The deplorable attitude of both sides is the reason why I stand in the middle and I don't budge towards either side.

But you first need to hold accountable the side that broke the rules first. There is a cause, and then there’s the effect. CCP/HK government/police were the cause for this violence and mayhem in the first place. HK hadn’t seen any violent protests or riots since 1967. So suddenly after 52 years people just decided to lose their minds and randomly beat people up? What led to all this anger, frustration, and desperation that prompted these violent conflicts in society?

Let’s say two kids are playing a game. Kid A decides to cheat, and gets called out by Kid B. But not only is Kid A unrepentant, he decides to carry on cheating and over the years, his cheating gets worse and more serious. After 22 years, this cheating becomes so blatant and intolerable that Kid B demands that Kid A play by the rules or else Kid B will stop playing and quit. Kid A responds by punching Kid B in the face. Kid B can’t take this shit anymore and finally decides to fight back. If you’re their teacher, would you subject both of them to equal punishment? Even if you claim to be neutral and not take either side, by default you would be treating Kid B unfairly because you would be ignoring all the underlying circumstances and only pointing out the fact that both kids threw punches at each other, not the fact that Kid B has had to put up with all sorts of cheating and abuse by Kid A, and that Kid A was the instigator of everything that happened. 

Lastly, about your video clips. Literally none of them provide enough context to allow any reasonable person to properly assess the situations filmed and determine who was at fault. They all start in the middle of the conflict/violent confrontation, with no context given, no explanation given for the circumstances and what led up to the confrontations. Also, some of the sources are biased and/or Chinese state media. You really think they are credible sources of information?",2020-06-15 08:31:53

pk8q2m,">	In some cases, there is evidence that the alleged killings took place at the instruction of patrol commanders, who told young soldiers to make their first kill by executing prisoners, a practice known as “blooding”. The alleged victims were not combatants and there was no doubt or confusion about the intent of the special forces soldiers, the report said.

>Earlier work by the military sociologist Samantha Crompvoets disclosed allegations that two teenage **Afghan boys had their throats slit by Special Air Service operators**, and canvassed “body count competitions” and the indiscriminate killing of “squirters” – villagers who fled from a helicopter’s approach.

pk8q2m,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.

it’s a copy paste, I like koalas 🐨",2021-09-09 03:21:12

It’s an island with a relatively small population, so I wouldn’t expect to do a care free dance in the streets anytime soon if you live somewhere else. 

America, where I live, is turning into an infection shit show.

94xg4c,"I love video games like you do, probably a bit too much! Maybe the person was just referring that too many kids play video games **only or mostly**. Everything in moderation! That’s why I have been branching out and doing other stuff like reading more books and learning how to use GameMaker! It’s been fun, and exploring how things are developed with videos by people like Mark Brown is really helpful! A nice way to “get away” from games without moving away from it fully 😉. Besides that, I respect your pedigree and defence of video games. It really is an under appreciated medium for an industry that is dominating at the moment. I also believe in variety in what you play! Don’t always play the same shooters! Branch out and try puzzle games like Zachtronics’ stuff, or try your hand at some RPGs, etc. Doesn’t hurt to see what else is there in such a huge medium!",2018-08-06 06:19:21
94xg4c,"In all fairness, one couldn’t be an alcoholic without alcohol existing; same for games, drugs, etc. but that’s beside the point.  Honestly, there’s really no one person or thing at fault.  Sure, I could stop playing, but games could also suck, which they don’t, so I’ll play them because I enjoy them.

And I guess I came off like I’m some dude in his 30s who lives in his parents’ basement and smokes weed with his high school friends, but that’s not even remotely who I am.  I’ve had and have aspirations, and fulfilled them.  

What I meant by “dreams” in this case (I could have been clearer for sure) is that while I am indeed a responsible adult, I kinda sorta got here by drifting.  I wasn’t the kind of kid that grew up saying “I want to be a cop”, or “I want to be a doctor,” or fill-in-the-blank career.  I never really thought about my future and how to get there - just when I could go home and game.  Mind you, this isn’t every single day, but it’s often enough for me to experience the mind-numbing effects.  There’s other interests that I ignore completely because I’m finishing up an RPG storyline, or because I’d just rather do something easy to me (like play a game I’m good at) than try hard at something I’m lousy at.

I know I don’t have all the answers, and probably not even the right ones.  But I’m honestly just fascinated by the phenomenon of video game “addiction”, and/or just the effects playing often has on the human mind.  

And I’d look more into it, but I’m finishing up a game right now 😉",2018-08-06 21:38:13

97kq1c,">It is as easy as diet and exercise, it comes down to...

Unfortunately my mental condition requires ice cream DAILY for my mood. And dairy makes me really tired (Cuz I'm kinda lacktowse intohlerent) so exercise after that is frankly out of the question. 

So basically No ice cream = no happy

 so your whole argument is fundamentally flawed unless your diet includes daily ice cream (unfortunately I have yet to find one 😤)

Hah, would it? You've cut and diced this so much you've separated it from your line about having a stop line across the major road at a junction with no traffic lights 😏. We don't really have the same kind of uncontrolled crossing that's in the video here in the UK, do we? Having a zebra crossing at the same point as a T junction seems like a recipe for having drivers edging out to turn left with their head firmly turned right to check for traffic in the lane they're joining, oblivious to any pedestrians who step out onto the tarmac.",2020-01-21 09:17:45

My dads reaction was not the same when he came home. I imagine in my wife did a major decision like that without me I would be upset.   Over the years my dad grew to love that dog so much.   

A few years ago when our family dog passed away we buried him in the backyard. That day was probably the most vulnerable I have ever seen my dad as he cried unable to speak and my mom held him.   His name was Rocky, he was a Pomeranian about this size of a fox 🦊 and kind of looked like one except with much longer hair.

Edit: I have no problem with firefighters spending a bit of tax money to enjoy themselves. Police, on the other hand, if they bought a half dozen coffees with tax money I would take them to court lol.",2018-02-24 06:12:34

They are huge but they don’t need lots of space to run and play. They’ll do it, sure, but they can be just as happy chewing on Nylabones and sleeping all day. Bathroom duty (no pun intended) can be a chore but they are big enough to sit on a toilet so a little extra training should solve that issue. 👍😆 Good luck finding your pup either way.

9yirts,"So a horse sized duck is a dinosaur. Duck teeth? No thank you. Especially a muscovy, they have actual talons. They're omnivores that repeatedly stab and shake their prey to death. Make it a horse sized goose and you've added a barbed tongue. A herd of duck sized horses though could be manageable only because of their tiny status. Like a gang of 12 lbs dogs (going with the mid sized weight of domesticated ducks) that are all herbivores. They could for sure hurt you and probably overwhelm you if you fell down but at the end of they day they can't fly away so you could always just step on them. A horse sized duck is a 1,000 lbs dinosaur that finally got it's dinosaur status back and it's going to break your spine with its mouth or wings or legs the second it gets close enough. 😧😧😧😧 I cannot stress enough how terrifying ducks are.",2018-11-19 22:33:14

She’s ALWAYS wanted a dog, but because her family was more or less allergic to them she could never have a therapy dog. Her abusive parents would tell her “we wouldn’t even want a hypoallergenic dog here. It’s just not worth having a dog” so after a year or so of marriage with all she went through she finally brought it up to me, scared that I’d treat her the same as her parents. 

I surprised her with our new best friend Diesel. Pug/blue heeler mix, odd combo.. but the cutest thing. Due to her GP, she suffer severe malnutrition which has caused her to pass out. One day she fell and hit her head hard enough the downstairs neighbors called the landlord, landlord called me, I rushed home to find my wife dizzy, but conscious with little Diesel bug licking her face every time she got close to dozing off. While I was there, she got dizzy and started to fall over a little bit. Diesel nudged his way under her head and arm..

Unless Russia's entire army is a front and not nearly as manned as it seems, this would be the only real reason why basically every surrendered Russian is a new conscript and doesn't know what they're doing.

9hi5v2,Thanks ❤️ this is the second time in two days I’ve made a hp comment and gotten gold (diff accounts). It pays to be a Harry Potter obsessed stoner I guess! ,2018-09-20 23:17:48
9hi5v2,"There are several answers to that question that kind of go together. In general it has been (and in many ways still is) an issue of entry barriers. It is extremely expensive to buy these tools. C4D costs $3000-5000, Houdini is about $800 I think, xParticles same ballpark.

That's a lot of money, and there are hardware costs (this stuff needs serious muscle) on top of that. Once you've got your hands on the tools, you've got to learn them. They are wide and deep. It is a massive time investment (years if not decades). Once you have all that, you STILL have render times. Even with MASSIVE hardware budgets it can still take hours and hours to render a single frame at high resolution. 

Those factors combined have produced much of the cost for producing high quality motion graphics. You need an army of people who have each spent years and thousands of dollars on the tools, and they all need to be working on an array of cutting edge hardware. Add in administrative overhead and you're talking $$$$.


Now, though, we are in the midst of a technological revolution - we have incredibly powerful graphics cards, AI, better designed software. 

All the advancements developed to drive VR and the new generation of games also apply here. What used to take hours to render can now be done in minutes (sometimes). What used to take years to learn can now be picked up in much less time. New subscription models and the maturation of open source tools (Blender!) make it possible to ""get in"" for hundreds, not thousands. 

Octane is the hottest rendering engine on the market right now (Westworld and Altered Carbon intros are both Octane 😍) and you can subscribe for $20 a month. With Octane, it is possible to produce good quality renders on a machine that is merely decent in sub-agonizing time frames.

The other side of the equation is the learning process. It still takes a lot of time and work to learn these tools. As people learn, they want to share what they're working on, so they post it to various community sites. Fans and others convert clips to gifs (I saw a few others by this bird guy in the octane render community on FB, he has a really nice one of a smokey panther) for that sweet sweet karma, and there you have it :)

TL;DR: technology continues to enable the democratization of media \m/",2018-09-20 23:08:52

Machine learning to find Car make, License Plate, location coordinates, and maybe getting the amber alert message to include a link to images. 

Unless Apple were to go a step further and build out an RCS deployment service that would push to iOS/Android users with this richness & still push out walls of texts for backwards compatibility. Clearly they care since they’re using ML to detect CP and Apple already has location services in the iPhone SOS feature.

They’re obviously obligated to investigate but they’re supposed to do in accordance to the law which states that there needs to be sufficient evidence supporting the claim of drug trafficking. 


If you would take the time to look up the details of this particular case you could see that there was little to no evidence pointing towards this individual’s position of guilt...only “evidence” they were going on, was based on BIASED reports from anonymous neighbors lmao

cr7lbq,"You need to think tactics, take out the rear one and they will all stop.  Think like the Taliban. IED’s in the road nice 👍🏻 

Yes,yes I know we are a peaceful protest and don’t want to give them excuse to fire on us..... well they are going to do it anyway. How did that go last time ?, what country stepped in to help stop them from killing so many in cold blood - none.

This is your country, you chose to stand up and fight for your very lives, well don’t half ass it as they say. Where roads are used,holes appear out of nowhere ( deep ones) and suddenly those vehicles won’t be going forward. You have the people to do so much and obviously the will .... so why not ?. 

I know very well that I’m not there and don’t know what I’m talking about. But if someone is going to kill me I’m taking as many of them with me as I can. Those facial recognition photo’s of you protesting ..... I wouldn’t wait to be killed.

This may seem harsh, but no one’s coming to save you. Now get freakin pissed off and put them down. ( I wish the USA would just take them on already, it’s now or in the future and I’d rather save lives now. ( yes if they would let me I would gladly go to the front lines and die if I didn’t have to read about men and women being mowed down in machine gun fire). Life is to important for some maniac to think it’s nothing to kill men, women and children and yes children.

Consider how the ""😛"" can be used to denote a joke where it wouldn't be obvious with text alone.

At one point we thought that no one would ever be able to run a sub-four-minute mile, and look how that’s changed. But I feel pretty confident in saying that humans won’t ever be able to run, of their own power, faster than we’d be able to free-fall.

71hi7c,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2017-09-22 00:31:53

Great work OP, both my wife and I (just celebrated 25 year in 2018) appreciate the beautiful design of the box, but also the care and time that went into a unique way of asking for your fiancés hand in marriage.  Congratulations to both of you and May you have a long and wonderful life together.

I will leave you the immortal words of Ogden Nash that have served me well for 25 years:

“To keep your marriage brimming, With love in the loving cup, Whenever you're wrong, admit it; Whenever you're right, shut up.""

P.S. you have set  yourself a high bar for anniversaries 1,2, 5, 10, 15, 20. 25, 30 and all multiples 5 until death do you part.  So, better start cataloging some ideas. 🙂

obd9z2,"I guess you just ignored the covid murder rate part of my comment. Also, I’m not white, but cool, cool. 

Also what a fucking dumb way to think about that. Are you implying all white people are violent Marxist’s? Also why the fuck are you guys so scared of different economic systems, but also ignore that they’re completely different systems maybe because the rich fuck on tv, who made his wealth from his parents that sold shitty frozen dinners, wants you to tax him less so he says stuff that connects with you dumb fucks? 

I’ve noticed you guys do this weird name calling too. Wtf is “race hustle”, maybe people want to live safely and don’t want to be scared of the government officials that they pay for?

Get better at trolling man.

Edit: bruh, I looked through your comment history, and you literally talk about being threatened by a cop, being scared of your life, and getting fucked with by racists. Literally look up any tucker Carlson viewpoint and read a dissenting opinion. Marxists are a different word for boogie man. He lies constantly, asking questions that have obvious answers, and pretends like he’s a voice of reason. Asking questions in a reasonable tone doesn’t make it reasonable. 

Okay, done commenting, idk why I even do this, no one ever actually cares about facts. This just makes me angry and is pointless. Take care 🤙",2021-07-01 07:46:09

This man is a piece of shit and should be made to feel that pain he inflicted on those young girls he molested and assaulted. Judge or not, he should not be treated any other way than he was here. If anything it could have been more harsh. She probably held back a lot. During the trial itself the judges do need to remain neutral but after you plead and are convicted, the sentencing is the judges turn to speak their mind and share a fraction of their own opinion. Offer guidance and what not depending on the situation at hand. And I guarantee you if it was a male judge it would have been a much harsher reprimand I feel, but who knows, maybe not. But people wouldn’t say anything or complain about the response if it was a male judge, they would probably applaud him.

They should have made him an honorary officer with a little badge before relocating him! 😂

6bh8oy,"I was in Philadelphia one night and had a pitbull approach me. It was a stray. It followed me for 2 blocks. Seemed nice until it jumped up on me once and I pushed it off me. That must of set the dog off. Bit me in my ass. I punched that dog so many times but it would not stop. The next time it charged I faced it head on and kicked it in the head. That's subdued him long enough for me to get the dog in a choke hold. He was still snapping at me so I put him to sleep. I walked about and he got up and took off. Dogs are very much a product of their environment. I have a pitbull and it is the sweetest dog I have ever had.  When an animals is raised in an abusive situation it's taught to defend itself to the death. They don't have a playful defensive mode. I don't fear dogs and most dogs acknowledge that as soon as I'm around. I've had people tell me ""my dog hates everyone, but for some reason he likes you"" ... must be the peanut butter in my pocket. 😂",2017-05-16 17:51:43

av8cs7,"I'm sorry... But modern wool/synthetic socks and hiking footwear types are made to get wet, and drain gradually. Unlike the  old school thought of ""water proof"" hiking boots, unless you're hiking freezing conditions. Waterproof boots just do a way better job of keeping water (and sweat) in, leading to trench foot.

I embrace the swampy areas, small water crossings, and puddles by running through. Easier to take time later and wring out the socks a little. Many canoe packing, portage, camping trips... Soggy AT section hikes (including the 100 mile wilderness), and countless miles trail running have sold me on this. 

Embrace the suck of (temporarily) wet feet, use proper gear, and have happy feet 😀",2019-02-27 11:30:36

the feminist part where I mentioned was the huge ""success"" of it. It was made a big deal & blown out of proportion because it was a first female only superhero movie. 
The feminist theme is there because the director & lead said so themselves.

The movie was bad. No, not god like compared to BvS etc. Compared to Suicide Squad it is just bland. Because SS was a special kind of bad.

And starved of good DC superhero movies? *Batman*. That is all I need to say.",2017-12-18 02:18:24

7kopvl,"They learn how to pass each other before they can actually race, the game is quite technical tbh! Going over the jumps and retrieving the ball is the easy part, running that fast on a team of four dogs and staying in your lane and fetching the ball without running over to chase the dogs on the other team (or your own team lol) is the hardest part of training for flyball!!! It usually takes a year or 2 of slow practice at home before it can be put together in a tournament racing format like this!

I’m a PhD in molecular biology, so i don’t get down below the molecular level. No (known) quantum phenomenon in biology! Good luck!",2019-07-31 20:16:18
ck5b4k,"No, seriously 😂 I've been using the quantum model so long that I forgot what other models are. All the theories we use are based on quantum mechanics. Every time I see a Rutherford model I say it to myself, ""no, that's wrong.""",2019-07-31 20:47:25
ck5b4k,"56... don't feel old... till phrases like ""in my day"" come out of my mouth...

😜",2019-07-31 14:18:51
ck5b4k,"...like I said in other comments on this thread, my thing was art, and like the hard sciences, many times a very solitary endeavor.

But my point was about school not just being about getting your degree, but also helping to shape you into a well-rounded, civil, citizen.

...and I also made the point that we still don't understand a lot of the phenomena that occur when humans are in close proximity to each other, as in when women's periods sync up when they spend time in groups together.

and we know about pheromones, we know about quite a lot of other dynamics at play when humans interact physically, socially.

... I'm not dissing online learning, I was, for almost a decade, the head of the Office of the Registrar for an online university, so I'm a fan, I'm all for it.

(and, we were not one of the ones taken down for being a diploma mill I will proudly say. We WERE investigated, and found to be in full compliance of all state and federal regulations, and of great value to our students during my time there...sorry, I don't toot my own horn much but I am proud of that fact considering how many people went through so much hell trusting disreputable online universities.)

... but I do recognize through life experience that people treat each other differently in person than online, and people learn differently in person than online, 

and as I also said in other places on this comment thread, I'm all about ""and"", not ""or"", you know?

... so, not disagreeing with you, just adding an additional point.

😊

drt2n2,"That's a fucking horrible program and should be illegal. You're literally bringing a non native animal to control native populations. That's worked so well in the past. Not to mention, cats are indiscriminate killers, carry rabies and have a life expectancy of about five years outdoors.     

So effectively, your ""humane"" society is putting these cats into an environment where they can be disease infested serial killers for a handful of years before they're run over by a car or eaten by something bigger. But it's ok because at least they're not breeding. 🙄. 

The people who come up with this shit shouldn't be breeding. If you love cats, give one a fucking home.",2019-11-05 10:52:20

7tkgak,"Not in my words:
“The neck strap puts pressure on the back of the neck which causes an instinctive relaxation response when the dog tries to pull forwards. The dog will instinctively lean back against the pressure, putting an end to pulling on the lead forever. Traditional collars put pressure on the front of the throat, causing dogs to keep pulling even while choking. Gentle Leader® does not choke your dog. It has been scientifically designed to direct the dog’s entire body by controlling its head & nose – and wherever it’s nose goes its body will follow.”

I’ve used it on my dog and it works wonders ",2018-01-29 03:01:18

Yeap this is a dictadorship and this government has been in the power for 20 years... not because fair elections but because they own the military! They give the people food boxes for them to go... if they don’t go they cannot eat because the minimum wage is 8$ a month.... Very sad indeed! I am Venezuelan an it is terrible here, no medicines or food not mentioning that the water and electricity shortages are very common and we have the highest murder rate of the continent.... SO HAPPY that finally the world has decided to help us as civilians without guns or money can’t take this government down!! We have tried several times and only last year more than 200 young unarmed people was killed by the military.... so PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THE DICTADORSHIP 💕 and this is not a coup! What Chavez did I in 1999 was a coup, the most corrupt government in the world! They talk about socialism with a Rolex in their wrist and have fortunes of billions of dollars stolen from Venezuela in their accounts, oh by the way their sons and daughters live in NY, Paris and Madrid! So socialist! ",2019-02-13 13:40:47

Russia and China were all to happy to set up sweetheart oil-for-debt deals for themselves too. 

But yeah, America's fault. We totally want to exploit a country that has the sourest, most expensive to refine oil after sipping on lean domestic frak oil for the past decade. 🙄🙄🙄

Downvote all you want, it doesn't change the truth.  It does prove how triggered you are by facts going against your ideaology however! ",2019-02-13 02:56:08
apzyqb,"If Venezuela’s socialist policies didn’t force the whole nation to rely on one commodity, then the US sanctions wouldn’t have had any affect on the well-being of the country. If Venezuela wasn’t such a socialist shithole ([source](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10715.pdf)) then they wouldn’t have been sanctioned in the first place. Wanting fair and open elections is interference?🤔 “corporate manipulation of commodities” is such a unspecific statement that sounds like you pulled it out of a hat to knock down capitalism again. Please be more specific. 


Regardless of what you say, kids are famished in Venezuela and it wasn’t always like that before socialist policies were ramped up. China, strictly economically speaking has embraced capitalism pretty aggressively and has diversified their economy (definitely not a socialist policy) in order to prosper.

It’s pretty sad you come from India, a country where everyone knows how corrupt the government is, and you still seem to support big government policies like socialism. ",2019-02-13 04:10:32

When I was a child there was a octopus I saw three times. It let me approach it and eventually hold it in my arms and pet it and was just as curious about me as I was about him. The range of colors it changed was phenomenal! I was 6 ish. I would say it’s tentacles were 3’ long. Hard to say though when you are a kid everything is so big.

The ones that pass are allowed to live wherever. The ones that pass but are still the fucking worst at driving are exiled to Long Island.

8c67xk,"I think what underthestares meant was that mistakes are how we learn, and that they had used the experience to say ""now I know"". Throwing shade at someone for a mistake and saying ""you should have known"" is expecting an individual to have possessed knowledge/information they didn't have before the mistake. I personally give props to underthestares for sharing the example, as I bet there are a number of redditors out there who were enlightened by the story.
That said, I DO agree you're right - you should ALWAYS ask an owner if you can touch their dog prior to sticking out your hand (hello, safety). Just think it's a good thing to acknowledge that mistakes can be healthy 😊",2018-04-14 14:20:25

Software engineering is tough and demanding. It’s a high stress field and if it’s causing that level of anxiety, it might not be the right fit straight away. Nothing wrong with that. Life is about figuring out where you really fit in. 

Five hours is an eternity a day, that’s 25 hours a week. You can paint, bike, hike, learn a new dish, a dance step or two even! As you age and life adds in family commitments, friend outings, you’ll chuckle at 25 hours free time. 

I know it’s tough out there. You have degrees, like everyone else. What will differentiate you is effort and your ability to be happy with what life has given you. Strive for more, but know Quinn_____ you’re more than a software engineer, you’ll show everyone how fucking awesome you are in your own time 👍",2020-06-25 19:16:42

96kxxf,Oh God! This reminds me of my recent shame. I went to get a pedicure and had this nice Chinese guy doing my feet. After soaking them for about 15 minutes he came over and started scraping then exfoliating my soles. I have ticklish feet but this guy must have had magic fingers because the moment he touched my feet I was squirming in the vibrating chair. By the time he started scrubbing with a pumice stone I was panting and everyone else had stopped what they were doing to watch the spectacle that was me. Meanwhile he was grinning and really putting his back into it. I have never had anyone touch my feet that way and needless to say I tipped him well despite the utter shame I felt and went home to masturbate till my fingers fell of!🤣🙈,2018-08-12 09:22:16

I wouldn't want some random gross stranger touching me, but most people I like i would be happy with a spontaneous pat from. But even if there are people who like zero percent of pats they could have (strange and weird, but possible), they're valid too. I shouldn't like, invalidate their strange no pat policy for comedic effect- we should study it, so I can understand their inclinations. Never have a pat? 😢

hbgsm3,"That was my first thought as well! Horses are beautiful, majestic creatures but they can be dense as cement and startled by the most inane things.

I was doing a trail ride once and a teenager in our group was picking up trash along our route. He picked up a Coke can and started to shake out the gravel inside and the group lead shot up and snatched his hand real quick; said the horses would hear the sound thinking it was rattlesnakes and they'd buck and run 😬",2020-06-18 22:00:17

hbgsm3,"Agreed. My only scary experience with this though was in Iceland on a horse riding trip. I'm only really used to being on a slower horse. My horse's name was ""Guard"" in Icelandic and they didn't tell me the reason why until later. 

All of the horses knew the route and were just trotting along. Guard and I were in the back of the pack going slower, which was fine with me. When suddenly he gunned it, pushed through all the horses and made it all the way to the front. I thought I was gonna die and he was running loose lol. Finally I learned that he liked to be in the front of the pack but he'd fall to the back and keep running back up to the front every 10 minutes or so 😔 I used so much adrenaline that day",2020-06-18 21:07:07

We had apparently gone up the trash chute and made it to the final room first, complete with the boss, a bugbear names Klarg. As a paladin, I had a pretty high charisma stat, 16, and a big boost in persuasion and deception. For ten rolls in a row, I was able to roll over 15, convincing the bugbear that there was some dude in a town twenty miles south that said he could beat Klarg. Klarg then stormed out the cave in a fit of rage. MFW I was able to charisma our party out of the first boss fight 😮",2019-01-30 15:02:11

I miss Balu.. he was born 32 years ago. and still remembered me when I went back to visit after 15 years.  Last visit was in 2020 right before the pandemic and he looked good. 

He’s more just lended out to other families or Hindu temples for festivals but he doesn’t do much.  

I love how when he sees me.. all he has to do is smell and he remembers me again 😭

It was the car window, zebra was outside.

Were driving down the road and stop because there are about 4 or 5 zebra in the road. They're all slowly moving from left to right, munching grass as they go, having a bit of a look about.

One of them just stands right in the middle of the road, looking at the car like ""what do you want?"".

There's not much you can do in this situation but wait for the zebra to move.

He (or she) very slowly starts walking to join the others, so we squeeze past behind him.

Were going about 2mph to avoid scaring the zebra. As we slowly roll past his bum, I'm thinking ""oh god, please don't poop"".

Mum was in the back seat with her window down, dad driving the car, me in passenger seat in the front.

Bare in mind we're bored of looking at zebra at this point and have been waiting for a while, dad was a bit impatient so the zebras bum is no more than 10 inches from the window of the car.

Just as the zebras bum comes level with my mums open window - the zebra let rip.

The timing was perfect. It was like payback for making him move out of the road, I swear it was a calculated tactic. I'm leaning on biological warfare rather than courtesy.",2022-10-14 14:00:01

See everything outside our dimension, that’s eternity, eternity’s looking down on us. 

Now to us, it’s a sphere, but to them 👆....its a circle. In eternity where there is no time- nothing can grow, nothing can become, nothing changes. Till death created time to grow the things that it would kill. You are reborn, but into the same life, that you’ve always been born into. I mean how many times have we had this conversation? Who knows? You can’t remember your lives. Can’t change your lives. And that is the terrible and secret fate of all life. Your trapped, in the nightmares you keep waking up into.",2020-10-13 04:06:42

The dog seemed to be of the lazy type and didn't care for exercise and just wanted to lounge all day.  On the walk back to the car the dog had enough.  He stopped in the middle of the parking lot and the owner was talking to him to convince him to keep walking.  Nope.  He was a stubborn dog.  The owner then walked away.  Wondering where the guy went I walked over to the dog and he laid on his side to let me pet him.  He was loving it until a car came and rolled to a stop by us.  It was the owner.  He had went to get his car to pick up the dog 😂.  He opened the back door of the car and all of the sudden the dog had enough energy to get up and hop into the car.

aj5yvu,"I'ma​ more afraid of mountain lions and than black bears, because a black bear can be chased off and unless it's protecting it's cubs, is generally not violent towards humans. Cougars on the other hand have actually stalked humans. Chances are, a black bear with GTFO if it bears me coming. A mountain lion would silently observe and try to determine if I am food.

There's just something unsettling about being prey.

Every night. And they both stole my heart. Whiskers (R.I.P) amazing cat who snuck out every chance she got only to return with several dead birds and mice etc. All on our doorstep.

The snort happens when a deer is positive there’s danger around. It means whatever methods you’ve employed to camouflage your body, noises and scents haven’t been enough. The snort sounds similar to a human sneeze, and nothing is more disheartening than hearing it off in the distance just when you’ve given up for the day and decided to start making your way out of the woods. The deer will snort, raise its tail and run away. The sound will alert other deer, and they’ll all do the same.""

9l0rfe,"Thanks for sharing your story, rip Rudy. He’s probably in his own paradise where everything he eats is actually edible no matter the size or shape :) 

I have two border collies one that my parents bought from a breeder (I know) who’s about 9-10 now that’s name is Abby. The other dog is also a border collie my older sister adopted who’s guessed to be one year younger than Abby but we aren’t 100% sure who’s name is Eli.

You always hear how smart border collies are. That they are natural herders and fast. They both try to herd us when we play basketball, ping pong, or ride bicycles. Abby is a genius, Eli... he’s a little special :) 

Eli reminds me of Rudy a bit, he loves to eat things he’s not supposed to. He used to be a house dog but he kept causing trouble by climbing on the counter and getting into food. He ate all the Halloween candy one year, which we didn’t realize until he went to the bathroom a few days later and we saw skittles. 🤢 He has chewed the wood off the door frame and column. He eat Abby’s food and the cats if he sees it. The other night I caught him eating a paper towel roll and ripping into cement bags and grout.(I don’t know if he actually would have eaten that though) He is a clumsy goofball that makes a lot of trouble but he is super sweet and loving. He can’t catch the ball like his sister but he tries his best and flips like a dolphin in the air falling on his face trying to get the ball. 

Well just thought I’d share my dog story as well :)",2018-10-03 20:56:16

gvmzg3,"Yes, the biggest reason was definitely wanting to keep the masks for medical workers, but I do think we didn’t have the data we have now about how the virus is transmitted. It’s new, right? And now the CDC says wear a face covering. New data, new recommendations. 

I remember in.. what was it.. early March (?).. watching the NY city infection and death rate. A friend of mine said people should just wash their hands more. I told her I wasn’t sure everyone in NY city just picked their nose too much, that it looked like an airborne virus to me. So I masked up, just in case. 

Now I know my little cloth mask mostly (maybe exclusively) helps others, not me. But I’m glad I did it anyway. I’m happy to keep doing it too. 

I still agree with the CDC advice to mask up for others, but I do wonder about the other side of this now. It actually *has* led to a false sense of security in some circumstances (mainly heated, emotional protests). 

I don’t know.. it’s not fun to live in “interesting times.” 😂",2020-06-03 14:45:41

ii2my5,"Haha there was a little restaurant in my area in the 90s that was battling local govt over something. They bought the house directly across the street from the restaurant and painted it like a giant American flag. I remember it vividly because I was in middle school and a kid I went to school with was stuck living in that house as a rental and he'd have to come out to catch the bus and asshole kids would make fun of him all the time. Eventually they moved and once the house was vacant the restaurant guy turned it into a petting zoo just to continue fucking with local officials 😂

E: I had to ask a local fb history group why he was doing all that stuff. He had bought the house to use for extra parking for his restaurant, zoning officials stopped him so he used the house to fuck with them in creative ways that made him a local legend lol

E2: comment from history group: ""Also, the people that owned the ice cream stand next to the shell station were complaining about people parking in their lot, so George started giving away FREE ice cream at the petting zoo👍👍😂George was a good guy""

E3 People on the fb page are adamant about the fact that he had gotten permission from the city to buy that house and turn it into parking. *After* he bought it they changed their minds. That's what started the battle and apparently it just snowballed from there. His name was George Diskes of George's World Famous Dinner Bell if you feel like reading local articles about him, apparently he really was a great guy and truly earned his legendary status :)",2020-08-28 13:15:23

>Worst economy in decades is absolutely,demonstrably not true, 

Oh it’s absolutely true. The unemployment rate is over 10%. If the federal government hadn’t spent trillions of dollars than it would be even worse.

>but the social unrest in democrat run cities is out of control, I agree.

ii2my5,"> Initially estimates were based on no lockdowns and no universal mask wearing with very little knowledge of the disease. Good to know you’re cool with 200k dead though.

So, initial estimates were in the multiple-millions, and Trump has been able to get that number down to 200K in the second largest country that’s accurately reporting its numbers. Beyond that, we have the lowest (one of the lowest, actually) IFRs in the world and have not had any kind of medical supply or space shortages anywhere in the country. Beyond that, the virus arrived here on Dec 31st of last year. I’d say all things considered, along with the fact that the US is #10 in cases/capita, we’ve done decidedly average in this response. If Trump is right and the US produces a vaccine before the end of the year, then I’d say we’ve done well. 

> Oh it’s absolutely true. The unemployment rate is over 10%. If the federal government hadn’t spent trillions of dollars than it would be even worse.

Unemployment was at 10% in the Great Recession of 2008/2009 - beyond that, the foundation of our economy has remained strong with limited businesses shuttering themselves and economic recovery occurring at an unprecedented rate relative to the bottom of the recession. 

> I love how the most powerful person in the country somehow avoids all responsibility for the current state of the country. 

Avoids all responsibility? No, I wouldn’t say he does. But I’d say the fact the DNC is not only silent on but actively encouraging misguided civil unrest, looting, and rioting makes it far more their fault than his. Can you show me where Biden has condemned the Marxists and Rioters in American Cities in the same way Trump has? Or rather, in the way Trump has condemned White Supremacy, alt-right ideology, and Neo-nazism? - https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/trump-has-condemned-white-supremacists/

> If Apple turns into a shitshow, the CEO gets fired, but you zombies would re-elect him 😂

It’s a country, not a company. 

> This is what happens when you campaign for 5 years on fear, hatred, division, and demonization of your enemies. 

I agree - we can thank the DNC for that. All they’ve done for 5 years is try to convince America that they’re being run by literally Hitler. Apparently it’s worked for some of our more... susceptible crowd. 

> This is Trump’s America. 

Yes, because it’s the guys in MAGA hats out burning cities down right now, lmao. You guys are ridiculous - “This is Trump’s AmeriKKKa” they shout as they set Target on fire, kill people, brick police officers, loot black owned businesses, and destroy their communities.",2020-08-28 16:36:24

gmylh0,What kind of punctuation mark is that 😳,2020-05-20 03:57:55
gmylh0,"Well — you could start by just looking for “jobs in Switzerland for English-speaking people” , e.g. at www.GlassDoor.com . Plenty of ‘em. 

But if *you yourself* are really that kind of person you *describe* there — someone who needs to be “placed” in another country, or *requires a whole lotta help* going through these applications (which you call “bureaucracy”, but are very real and essential to the Swiss), and *need help in trying to find a job* — sorry, Switzerland just isn’t the right place for you.🤷🏼‍♂️

Anyone from outside, from an entirely different country (society-wise and people-wise), would need to have a pioneer’s spirit and ‘frontier mentality’, that is: *more-than-average character, motivation, initiative, endurance & skills*, to start a new life there (if allowed). 
It’s not like hoppin’ over to Canada, hoping you’d find work as a farmhand, and if you don’t, oh well, we’ll just travel around & see what happens...
(Nope; if you lose your job or fail to complete your studies, the Swiss will kick you out that same minute.)

People *like you describe*, when freshly arrived from the USA to start a new life, wouldn’t even survive *the first culture-shock* ; and the whole experience would get them depressed & tired in 2 weeks: just being surrounded by German, French and Italian street signs all day, and mostly career-driven, self-centered, reserved and secretive locals, hastily hurrying by; in a pretty conservative country, non-spontaneous, free but kinda uptight & not exactly party-minded; eerily clean, like Singapore; strangely obsessed with bourgeois neatness, corporate success, extreme wealth and status, law & order, peace and quiet. 

Under the outward beauty, Switzerland is as cold as Ellen DeGeneres :( 
— and, for example, *definitely not* a country for the Burning Man / Lollapalooza / Spring-Break / Love Parade crowds; not for happy, outgoing, free-spirited hedonist people, lazy slackers, fashionable hipsters or SJW-minded folks, activists, extremely sensitive or NewAge-spiritual people, or so-called ‘snowflakes’. 

If you yourself are *like that which you described*, further above, nope: I’d just stay a tourist, if I were you...😉",2020-05-20 05:05:35

Here’s my Instagram, please tell me how I’m not actually an athlete (scroll down to 2016, the year I graduated college and you’ll find a couple photos of me at meets, wearing my college uniform, from university of Maine, a D1 school where I’m 2nd all time in the triple jump) 

Now let me share this with you, many professional 100m dashes are won in under 1/10 of a second, many times the difference between gold and silver is 1/100 of a second.

I love how you ask me to show you that 1/10 of a second is huge, I do that with this video showing that second place is 10.27, first place being 9.98, so the difference being .29 of a second. You think that’s huge but don’t think literally half that still wouldn’t be a huge victory, this is what we call “back pedaling” and you sir have lost the debate hahahah like have you even been to a track meet in real life or am I just arguing with some fake ass reddit armchair? Hahahha 

I’m not gonna argue with some “reddit armchair” about sports when you clearly don’t know shit, go back to being frustrated that monsters leave the area if you’re too crappy of a hunter to kill them quickly 😂😂",2019-05-01 11:35:29

While you have mentioned some points that are slightly correct most of your answer is completely false. 

Hydrostatic release units on ships contain a knife, not explosives. Lol can you imagine having a mini c4 on a ship carrying lpg/lng/oil? Disaster.

Also, this hydrostatic release unit you’re talking about on the lifeboat...doesn’t exist. The hydrostatic system if fitted on lifeboats is a completely different system for a completely different purpose. The two cannot be compared.

Some of your thinking is correct but you’re way off on some points.

Dude if you have any questions or would like to learn anything about this job hit me up in my DMs id be happy to answer 👍

Edit: the original question - can I just sit in a lifeboat while the ship sinks? 


Absolutely fucking not, I can’t even believe someone thinks that’s possible. I’m 100% positive that trying to launch a lifeboat with the ship going underwater will result in death.",2021-04-24 19:50:38
