10lu52o,"The society who found the puppies for the mama dog have done such an amazing deed. Just look at them being reunited.. Sometimes after Iooking at such situations, you really get a broader perspective of life. It just makes you think if money, home, car, gadgets is what we want to run behind in life. It just about being a basic person, having basic necessities and giving back to the society as much as you can. It just seems like the people who have little know the value and try to contribute more back to the society 🥹",2023-01-27 08:15:05

10lu52o,"I assumed you were offended because I made a logical argument to go vegan to provoke thought and you just stopped at the fact that you think you don't like vegans. Rather than discussing the animals, you wanted to talk about vegans and how annoying you find them. Seems like a cop out. 🤷‍♂️

What DOES your meat consumption have to do with vegans? Why does a discussion about not harming animals always turn into a discussion about how people hate vegans? 

Synopsis of this conversation.
Me: animals suffer when we kill them, go vegan!
You: oh I hate vegans they're annoying.
Me: well not all vegans... What's that got to do with the animals?
You: you can't make me be vegan! I'll never do it!

Cool. Good for you. You're a big girl with big free choices to make. But keep in mind that while it's a choice for you, it's an animals entire existence. Next time you eat one, ask yourself where it came from and if it deserved to suffer and die so you could enjoy it. Or if you coulda just eaten something else. 🤷‍♂️ Just a thought.

I'm sorry this conversation ended up being less than friendly. I hope you'll consider what I said and sincerely hope you have a good day. 😊",2023-01-26 18:59:32

10lu52o,"Edit: I meant to post this on the comment you were replying to, because I agreed with you 😂 I’ll leave it just so you arent confused why you got notified lol. 

I live with someone who works in the veterinary industry, and when we fostered a pregnant mama, one of them died literally seconds out of the womb. There’s nothing you can do and it’s exceedingly common. Read anything about how many live out of the average litter and you’ll realize how bittersweet it will pretty much always be if you’re there for a pet’s childbearing. I’m not saying that they were raised in a good place, because I have no idea with this specific video, but the amount who survived is not necessarily because of that.",2023-01-27 04:23:10

v6gvio,Imagine the parachute catches 🔥,2022-06-07 06:36:41
v6gvio,"I lived on the 21st floor of a 28 floor hi rise in Chicago for 6 years. There were a couple alarms but 1 major fire while I lived there, on the 14th floor. There were 2 stairwells, the fire was 7 floors below me and on the other end of the building, but the stairwell by me was still too smoky to go down. 5 fire engines were there but no fire ladder I know of is going to reach the 21st floor, I don't think? so we were really stuck. 

Anyways, this would not have worked in my building unless you smashed out a window. We had floor to ceiling windows, but only a smaller rectangle at the bottom opened - lengthwise, a few inches at the top. For safety reasons hi rises don't often let you just open a human sized portal into the abyss. Certainly in a real emergency you'd smash the window (if you were able to successfully... They are very strong), but ultimately things turned out fine and missing a floor to ceiling window in your home because you acted too quickly would be embarrassing. 

What happens when everyone in the building is landing on each other?

No, I don't have any better ideas except I don't live in a hi rise anymore 😂",2022-06-07 06:49:20
v6gvio,😂😂 the comments 🤣🤣🤌,2022-06-07 07:25:56
v6gvio,"Ok...and what of the 200,300,400 or so other people wanting and trying to use this at the exact same time? What if the first of 12 people in a room gets jammed into the window frame? What if a person crushes another person underneath them or suffocated them with the parachute thing? What if the person lands then bounces, catches an up draft and is blown back into the fire? What if 50 people jump with this and prevent the fire services from reaching the other 50 people trapped inside? Sooooooo many questions and untested theories 🤔🤔",2022-06-07 07:48:39
v6gvio,Imagine the fire heats up the air inside and you float away😂,2022-06-07 08:33:33
v6gvio,"I laughed so hard at this, especially once I found out it was real.

Also… are we not going to mention the fact the material could catch on fire as you’re falling to safety? 🤣",2022-06-07 08:50:27

15nwnyv,"Great interview. I had a similar experience when I was younger and I can remember the anguish of being ripped away from the other side and having to cope with being a human again. I’ve struggled with that my entire life tbh. Now I’m just kinda hangin around out of curiosity to experience how odd it is to be this particular being in space and time. No fear of death anymore, though. When it’s time to move on, I’m stoked for it. All in on this ride ✌🏽",2023-08-11 05:56:19
15nwnyv,"This is an amazing description of their singular experience, but one thing that made me giggle was the expression, “my vitals came back on an ambulance.” 

They probably have no recollection of that actual memory and are repeating a sound bite they were told by doctors much later, but it totally undersells that paramedics brought them back from the dead! 

As a paramedic myself, this is just a reminder to please advocate for us to get paid more and have better working conditions!! The people who are helped by us the most, usually don’t remember anything about us, after all, so our role in healthcare is often underrepresented. ❤️",2023-08-11 04:53:46
15nwnyv,"I feel like in way that’s the default near-death experience 😭 Like for religious people they see what they have been taught, and this checks out for all religious: Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, etc… So not having any expectations probably results in something similar to his experience.

But also at the same time we never truly know what happens after death, dude was stepping onto the threshold and maybe had one foot over such threshold but nobody who walked over and kept walking has been able to truly tell us what, if anything, happens on the other side.

I will say there was this one actually scientific study by an NYU pulmonologist that showed consciousness, for at least a certain amount of time, continued after clinical death before such people were able to be resuscitated. [source](https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/after-death-youre-aware-that-youve-died-scientists-claim/)

Honestly, at the end of the day I don’t think anyone will truly know what happens until it’s our turn.",2023-08-11 04:44:55

15nwnyv,"I don’t believe that guy literally “died” because it contradicts the definition of the word i.e. permanent cessation but I totally believe 100% of what he stated, including the aftermath of his internal struggle. He was more-so “clinically dead.” 

Based on reasoning, there is no afterlife or reincarnation. You don’t get to meet all your fallen relatives, friends and pets, like the ending of Titanic; you just basically take a forever nap. 

All you have is now, this moment. After than, the show is just over. 😞",2023-08-11 07:21:29
15nwnyv,"Given what I've bounced back from, yea- that fits the bill.

It feels peaceful for sure, and also kinda warm, not like uncomfortable weather warm, like under a nice blanket in a cool room in the dark kinda warm.

Death has a welcoming feeling to it, maybe its the minds way of accepting reality after concluding that it did all the right steps from reviewing your life for a means to survive?

This actually made me feel much livelier! ☺️ I'm actually excited to live. The dying part will hopefully be like an infinite, dreamless sleep-- no alarms or expectations left. And the part I'm really hoping for is all of my memories playing over again. 

I am definitely encouraged to live a memorable, fulfilling life just so that last reel of memories is something worth reliving. It'll be worth pushing through all of the struggles and turmoil just to see that accomplishment in the end. Even many of the drolls, tediousness, and boredom may be forgotten, and the results of the work will hopefully be what's remembered. If the bad memories are remembered, the good ones that come after will be too. It'll be like complete nostalgia for the rest of my life. c:",2023-08-11 14:39:38

15nwnyv,"Thank you for this interview! For all the skeptics here… First, good for you! We should question. We should never be afraid to doubt. Asking the questions is how we get answers. Actually in my experience, science and spirituality do intersect. I believe that within a few decades that will become mainstream. Specially now with the interest in the use of psychedelics and the research on those. These substances are the key to open our psyche. All that needs to come out to be processed does. Some good referents in that area are: Dr. Stan Grof, Dr. David Lukoff, Dr. Emma Bragdon. When my youngest was 13 he disclosed he was not sure we’re transcendent beings (if there is really a god out there who orchestrated the Universe) My response was to tell him to find out on his own. I told him to ask, and then pay attention to those significant coincidences called synchronicities b/c after asking with a genuine open-mindedness he will probably change his mind. About two weeks went by and one day he came all exited and said. Mom, now, everything tells me there’s something more to Life. So, lovingly I invite anyone to go through that experiment too. What is difficult to swallow is the anthropomorphic god that most  organized religions want us to have “faith in”. B/c of that is not hard to guess why many want to throw out any concept of that and confuse it with spirituality or the spiritual realm. But, religion and spirituality are not the same. One interprets for you and you follow, with the latter you experience it for yourself. Right then and there your spiritual journey begins and I promise that it does not take us through the same path, but wherever it takes you is exactly where you need to be. Differences are important. We’re fractals of Divinity, pieces of a Universe puzzle and all parts are needed and important to the All. We’re One, or as someone said the other day, we are all cohabitating in one point. Assignment: Find out what Transpersonal psychiatry/psychology, quantum physics, consciousness studies, recent developments in neuroscience, traditional plant medicine use (psychedelics), scientific (Kardec) spiritist literature originated in Europe and spiritualists from USA, parapsychology, near-death research, spiritual crisis/emergence and the logic behind reincarnation (time after time opportunities to learn, evolve and love), have in common. Fellow humans, the truth is out there, you don’t have to wait until you die to find out your own soul will give you a glimpse of that. With love and gratitude 🙏",2023-08-11 19:20:25

Thoughts linger so you may just remember the last thing that you thought of before it all goes silent. For me, I distinctly remember that I wanted to live. 🤣 Never been down that road again no matter what life threw at me. It's almost an instinct now to stay alive.

When you’re feeling up to it… Do some research on near death experience.  Also look up some episodes on YouTube of I survived beyond and back.  There are a lot of great books out there as well.

You might find the more you learn, you’ll be more open to believing there is some thing after for your brother. I’m not religious, but I am spiritual and I wish you healing Godspeed.☮️",2023-08-11 05:28:53

15nwnyv,"As a Christian, I too don’t necessarily like the idea of nothingness, but it does take a lot of mental strength to face the unknown. I actually have a fear of both halves. I’m afraid of that thought of the endless non existent void, but I’m also afraid of never ending foreverness (Apeirophobia). 

But after all our brains are purely biological. They only know what it is to BE. They don’t, and simply can’t, comprehend what it means to NOT BE. (Or at the very least to exist in a different manner if an afterlife truly exists) So I tend to just look for peace. 

I can assure you, the ones who really know (or don’t know lol) the answer ARE NOT gonna come back to tell you about it. Unfortunately it’s just something we can’t know this side of life. So don’t let the thoughts bring you down. But one day, if we meet in some place outside this life, hopefully we could look back at this memory and laugh 😆",2023-08-11 04:18:14
15nwnyv,"I mean… isn’t that exactly why literally anything at all feels good to us? 😆 magical chemicals, wham, good feels.",2023-08-11 04:23:15
15nwnyv,"I feel that’s exactly what it is… a rush of different  chemicals, adrenaline, dopamine, all the feel good chemicals that rush your brain and making you feel at peace 

No one wants to die but I can imagine after feeling that rush of endorphins that you couldn’t wait until the next time it happens 

That said I wish to die peacefully in my sleep 😴 

The scary part about dying I believe is if it happens in a terrifying way like the feeling of being scared just before it happens

I have a fear of drowning 😔 so I feel struggling for air while being surrounded by water is one of the worst ways to go

On a final note I’d like to put all that aside and say that I love my life and everything about it and I hope I live a long time to see my kids grow up and I can retire and live out my days in peace and just enjoying life",2023-08-11 08:17:44

15nwnyv,"I can totally see death as a blank but peaceful state, but l also don’t think it’s truly permanent. We are all made up of energy and molecules that aren’t “dead” when we pass. It’s our bodies and brains that go. Personally, I think that somehow we all (Anything that’s living) come back and reconnect with the people/things/places that we’ve had a connection with before. Even if we are a different creature or in different galaxy altogether. It might take a hundred, or a million, or a billion years, but our energies morph back together and gravitate towards each other eventually. I think this is true for our strongest connections with the people and animals/plants/things we are closest with too. In a different life, we would have no way of knowing that we’ve crossed paths before because we wouldn’t have the same brain/body or consciousness, but I find comfort in the thought that somehow and some day there is a reconnection. Even if we can’t remember our past experiences, we get to tell one another new stories and experience new life together. I dunno, helps me sleep at night 🤷‍♂️",2023-08-11 05:29:31

h0q4i6,"One of my favorite dancing routines besides Thriller was in Smooth Criminal when they leaned at a slant. I do know how Michael did it as a kid, but to my day, it gets me hyped up when I see it. My son (5yrs old then, 6 now) was trying to dance a few months ago; we don’t watch any music television channels such as MTV, BET, CMT or VH1 so he has no idea of the kinda of music or dances there are. But he was just a moving and said look Ma I’m dancing. I said honey that’s not dancing, if you want to see dancing, look at Michael Jackson videos. He was already a big fan of The Jackson 5 songs, ABC and Santa’s Clause is Coming to Town, but I had to show him the Number Ones videos so he could see what dancing was 😆.",2020-06-11 13:05:21
h0q4i6,The good old days 😂,2020-06-11 16:41:59
h0q4i6,"And I thought I was watching this now, but apparently it’s happening in 2019. However, my clock and calendar right now say this not happening in 2019, that the video might have been published in 2019 so perhaps it happened in 2019. Yet the video clearly shows this is what’s happening right now, apparently. Neither clock or calendar can seem to definitely put a finger on when “now” begins and ends, so my mind doesn’t exactly agree with this concept of time even though it’s said the mind is what conceptualized time. Somebody’s bullshitting...or so it would seem. 🤪😂

No one knows what’s happening but we sure like to tell the story and hear the stories about how we know what’s happening and that what all this is. 

“Life” is a magnificent mystery that will never be understood because it doesn’t need to be understood! Just look at what appears to be an aliveness of “enjoyment” seen in the video and by those who appear to be watching the video. It’s a complete mystery, a completely made up story trying to explain what’s happening, yet this “aliveness” just appears to be happening anyway. 

Yup, “this” seems to be an endless “Thriller!”",2020-06-13 19:54:20

But seriously, as kids we watched that video tape approximately 70 million times. I always liked the part where they showed the zombie and werewolf makeup process. Not just because it was really interesting, but because I was extremely young when I first saw Thriller and it gave me horrible nightmares and seeing the monsters were faked stopped them (kind of 😓).",2020-06-11 05:59:25

va180p,"This is so true and I didn’t realize how many types of “jobs” there are that they’d recognize. My ex and I took our BC mix sheepherding a few times and it was incredible to see her do her “real” job so naturally. In the first training session, she was running circles around the group of trainer sheep and chasing them back to the herd if they got away—she was not yet gentle lol, but the instinct was def there. 

But prior to that, there were so many little domestic jobs or games we’d play: we would separate around big forest parks (dog-friendly) and have her herd us back to each other, she learned how to cuddle, she would bring you a toy every time you arrived home, and—my favorite—I “trained” her to hop on the couch by shouting “RITUAL” when I got home so I could sit down and snuggle with her for a few minutes & calm her down/bond for a bit. I miss her the most. ❤️",2022-06-12 01:21:07

Either way stay the hell outta the military and pursue this amazing talent and skill you have whether you want to be a tattoo artist or any type of artist. You definitely don’t belong in the military with this amazing gift you have. Some of the best art work I’ve seen in a long time.

1czpio4,"When you act like saying ""the IDF is massacring civilians"" = ""Jews are all bloodthirsty demons"", yes you're acting like Israel can do no wrong and that criticizing them is antisemitism™.


Where you born during the Nakba? The Naksa? Sabra and Shatila? Palestinian children don't simply suffer from ""pTsD"" they die from Israeli missiles. How do you think Oct 7's fighters got radicalized? Probably not from the 500 children Israel killed in 2014 in Gaza, right? You're so blind to Palestinians' suffering, it would be funny if it didn't lead you to turn a blind eye on genocide. Israel has the Iron Dome anyway, Hamas' rockets have always been glorified fireworks that can't aim for shit so why do you act like it's an imperative to have boots on the ground that massacre kids like Hind Rajab.


If Israel can't survive without committing a genocide and implementing an apartheid state, does it deserve to survive or should it end up like the Confederacy, Rhodesia, French Algeria?

17yb76c,"Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown, And things seem hard or tough, And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft, And you feel that you've had quite eno-o-o-o-o-ough, 🎵Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving And revolving at 900 miles an hour. It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned, The sun that is the source of all our power. Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see, Are moving at a million miles a day, In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour, Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way. Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars; It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side; It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick, But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide. We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point, We go 'round every two hundred million years; And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions In this amazing and expanding universe. Our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding, In all of the directions it can whiz; As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know, Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is. So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure, How amazingly unlikely is your birth; And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space, 'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth!

TBH- I'm much better at faces than names.

I got in a slow line for a buffet lunch behind a guy I was sure I'd seen before so I started thinking.
Oh yeah 20 years prior at a weekend business conference I met him. 
Now What was his name?
Oh yeah he was one of three guys there all named (let's call it) Jason.

Jason, hey it's been a long time how are you doing? 

He turned looked at me flustered and asked who are you and how do you know my name?

So I reminded him of the business conference two decades prior. 

He laughed, I forgot about that job let alone the weekend business conference.
 then in a loud voice he laughed hey everyone this guy has a great memory we met once 20 years ago and he called me by name and asked how are you doing?

I've taken the test and flunked. I'll remember one face. My wife, however, is a super recognizer and she sees the face once and it's like it's in her memory bank. 
I love her because she will be like the women that were around Meryl Streep in the Devil wears Prada she'll say oh oh here comes so and so and that way I can save face so to speak.. 😃",2024-05-03 04:35:18

I know that I’d be infuriating, so when I do watch media I don’t ask who people are, I just deal with it and hope I figure it out by the end. I sort into “Good Guys” and “Bad Guys” and that’s the best I can hope for. Usually wardrobe and makeup are quite good at differentiating characters and that helps, but for the first three years I had to wait for dialogue to tell Phoebe from Rachel. Blondish white girls are blondish white girls, and eventually separated Ross from Joey due to height differences. 🤷🏻‍♀️",2024-05-03 02:48:32

etzi8z,"Hi ! This is me ! I created a reddit just to comment this !
After reading everyone’s comments I want to clear a few things up ❤️

I filmed this myself ! Marley is trained to alert to me before an attack hits so I can get in a safe place :) so I decided to film in hopes of spreading awareness of how severe attacks can be for autistic people and how much these dogs can help ,
Also to keep up on his training so I can look back and see if he did anything wrong ect 

Thank you everyone for all the love and support !

“Pit bull breeds are naturally strong, intelligent, and courageous. Their main goal is to please their owner. In the early 1900s, pit bulls were given the title of “Nanny Dog."" They were known to be faithful, loving, and loyal, especially when it came to children. A child's safety was practically guaranteed.”

“Their main goal is to please their owner” which is unfortunately one of the reasons bad people make them into fighting dogs. They just want to make their owner happy. 😔",2020-01-27 13:29:35

etzi8z,My attacks are exactly like this :/ feeling my heartbeat always amplifies it and I ALWAYS tremor. Every. Time. it’s something I’ve been struggling with on and off medication for about two years now. I’m finally getting a better grip on it with daily meditation and yoga practice.  It’s hard to explain to my partner because he doesn’t quite understand them but is always super supportive in the instance of me having an episode. it’s nice to know I’m not alone in this struggle in a way. Like the person said up there- I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy and it breaks my heart to see this person struggle with it. So glad she has that sweet angel to help her. Much love and light to everyone struggling with this 💕,2020-01-26 06:25:08

v4mnld,"I grew up in Lisse. Peeling the bulbs was my spring vacation job for about 7 years, starting from the age of 12 or 13. It was illegal to start that young, but we used to hide in the back when people came to check. 

The first 5 years we were seated at the big bins. It was pretty rewarding to empty out a few of those bins in the span of about 6 weeks. We’d have bursitis on our forearms from leaning them on the bins we were seated at and all our fingers would have been taped up by the end of it. Dust lungs, black snot, dust in our hair. But, because we were seated next to a collegue and in general with a lot of other kids our age, we’d have a great time plus it made more money then for example working in a store, in way less time.

The last 2 years (must’ve been 2005 or something) they moved away from working from bins. These days you’ll be seated at an assembly line, the bulbs already almost entirely peeled. [Here’s a video of it](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=J3t1tMYfkBg).

Over time, a bigoted man becomes such by having multiple (but still anecdotally) negative interactions with a specific type of person, and so they are predisposed with each subsequent interaction to come in with their mind already more and more made up, which can ultimately result in extremism for some, depending on their overall accumulated social experiences and world views.

>In 2008, a large piece of the meteorite – weighing around 420 kilograms – was put up for auction in New York and was expected to fetch over $2 million. However, buyers decided to turn their discerning eye to some fossilized dinosaur poo instead.

I believe they are slicing up the 420kg main mass into smaller $40 gram slices to sell easily. Selling every slice would net them $16.8million. 

The full rock weighed 1003kg and was divided up so it could be studied. The rock the guy is holding up is a 10kg slice.",2024-05-22 17:22:28

Sir George Casley (1773-1857) the concept of a fixed wing, for generating lift and a separate mechanism for propulsion was originated. Aeronautics. 

The Wright brothers drew on the rich heritage in aeronautical experiences left to them by their predecessors. They became interested in aviation after the flight of Otto Lilienthal (gliders) in 1896.

14n4vns,"Add to your list those absolutely adorable necrophiliac rapists… otters.

I can never look at them the same since my friend told me she doesn’t like them. And then she ruined my world view of otters. So, with great joy and the spirit of this cesspool that is Reddit, I will also ruin your world view of otters. 

They sometimes mate a female to death due to their aggressive mating nature… and will continue to mate her dead corpse for days.

They will also sometimes kill a male due to territorial disputes… and rape his body for ex curricular practice to prepare for the females… and this can happen for days after he has been dead.

They also, cross species with their rapey ways and will use baby seals for practice.

""The hens' instinct is to mate with the fittest, strongest drake to produce the healthiest chicks. The one she can't fight off... that's him.""

nhgk14,Oh I just stole that quote from an anime. In Fruits Basket the main character Tohru spent a good portion of her childhood alone because her mother was suffering from some severe depression. Tohru won’t eat alone because it makes her feel lonely. Excellent story every character has their own form of trauma they are trying to overcome. You remind me of Rin who hates eating in front of people to the point of starving herself and ending up in the hospital. It’s possible to overcome trauma in your life but not alone. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. ❤️,2021-05-28 03:38:26

We're not saying every kid needs 3 ipads and a personalized teacher bot, and a brand new football field.

kxlu8j,"Everyone should totally check out that PBS Space Time video linked above you. The ""pulling"" up doesn't happen so much as a ""squeezing"" coming from the tangential points on the earth from the moon. (If I'm misrepresenting you at all, sorry.) It's super common to think, ""ah, the moon has stronger gravity here at the closest point and weakest at the further point, voila, tide is being lifted."" But it's more about gravity force vectors from the tangential points. 

If the moon is on the left, earth on the right

🌜🌍 

the effect of the gravity is for the water at the top and bottom of earth (tangential points from moon) to push towards the sides closest/furthest on earth from the moon, which creates the ""bulge"" of the tide. 

It's not exactly a ""lifting"" or ""pulling"" from the side of the earth closest to the moon because ""that's where gravity's strongest."" Like, the moon's gravity isn't levitating the water. The effect is basically the same as that, but the mechanism is different. (Minus a whole bunch of other complicating factors, this is the gist.) 

Not sure if this emoji diagram will format right or be helpful, but will give it a shot. Blue water arrows show pushing from top/bottom towards sides, not lifting from sides.

ax1la9,"I have no clue, but as a guess it’s possible that they can’t mate at all. This is just going based on how, for example, albino peacocks will never get a mate because other peacocks don’t find them suitable because of their lack of color. And you couldn’t breed two albino ones because they each wouldn’t find the other suitable. It could work similarly for this lobster, but then again it depends whether lobster breeding has anything to do with their appearance (which it very well may not, since they live at the bottom of the dark ocean). I would look it up, but it’s 7am where I live and I’m at work so 🤷🏻‍♂️

Edit: spelling",2019-03-04 12:29:10
ax1la9,"If you don’t mind me asking, what’s the lifespan of a lobster? 1 in 1,000,000 chance of finding one of these is slim but surely if they live long enough and can remain fertile, somebody somewhere will have another to breed with it 🙂

1452nc7,"That might be true but there are indoor gyms specifically for Ninja athletes.There are few hundred across the nation. 

My son has been going to one in Phoenix for almost 3 years now (I think there are 6-7 total gyms in Phoenix). It's a great way to get exercise indoors - especially in the hot summer months ☀️

Many times, the obstacles at competitions are not the exact same ones the kids practice on at their respective gym. The amateur organization for Ninja athletes (UNAA) requires a minimum amount of obstacle styles but leaves it up to the competing gym to design the course. The final course design will be revealed a day or two before the competition. 

FYI: the UNAA world championships are July 26-30 in Orlando FL. Kids as young as 5 up to professional level adults will be competing!

kzl2wc,"I go to see an eye specialist (I don't know the English term but.. the doctor that's in charge of that department. Basically the most senior specialist) once a year for ~$15 usd for preventative reasons. Just to make sure that should my eye disease (keratoconus) progress, I will get it treated (cross-linking) asap.

This year it progressed, so I'm scheduled for two sepperate operations. One for each eye, about 1.5h of surgery per eye. Pain meds for about a week, antibiotics for a month. Times two. The most it can possibly cost me is $100. 

I will have two sepperate weeks of work (again one for each eye). I get 80% pay for those two weeks.

You know what worries me? What meal prep I need to do and how much it'll hurt. And if I can walk home after or if I should get a cab.

I'm scheduled for two minor eye surgeries, and it has almost no impact on my life outside recovery.

Oh and bonus, i have insurance from work so i won't be paying those $100 either 🤷‍♂️",2021-01-18 12:25:54

17tim5t,... did you double check that kid's ID? 😆,2024-04-05 21:08:25

17tim5t,What a show off 😝😝😝😝,2024-01-25 22:12:35
17tim5t,"I dont get people are so happy to get 10.00,  this a video its probably recorded at 25fps, so a second will show 25 numbers possible numbers around 10.00 which is not the same at as what this kid did. Plus the count in the video stops at 10.00, so getting 10.00 which means there will be more frames at 10.00 than any other numbers. 
So to anyone that missed well done for failing it even though u had a much better chance than this kid.... For everyone else that did it. Well done for not much 🤷‍♂️.",2024-01-25 23:05:45

I'm not the best at keeping tempo so I'd think it qould be easier for a drummer.",2023-11-12 20:44:30
17tim5t,Yep it’s 60bpm a very common tempo. I remember doing this with my eyes closed as some kind of sobriety test in high school when I was caught with weed. Had to count to 60. I did it almost perfectly and the security guard was pissed 😂 (yes I was high) although I think they’re probably watching if you can keep your balance as well,2024-03-24 23:58:23
17tim5t,This is the correct mindset. 👏,2023-11-12 15:22:08

- Spending less time in front of the mirror... so....
- less questions like ""do you think I'm [ fill in ]""  you actually don't wanna answer.
- Saves a lot of money
- Saves a lot of space  in the batthoom
- She doesn't freak you out in the morning when you wake up next to her.
- No lipstick on your collar 💋",2022-09-03 00:46:46

x46mbt,"Oh, please! Why don't they have a separate beauty contest like that, that would be very interesting, but selecting her for that reason too just seems counter to the meaning of what's required for women to look to win. I mean, she's pretty but all I'm thinking is what does she look like with her war paint on. 🤔😩

 The same applies to if 1 drag queen didn't wear makeup and became a finalist, it just doesn't fit the protocol.",2022-09-02 21:58:30

x46mbt,"My wife and my daughter both look beautiful without makeup and neither like wearing it. I thought my daughter might be gay just because she didn’t seem to be interested in wearing makeup to attract a man. And her two good guy friends were gay so I wasn’t sure what to think. Anyway, makeup is way over rated. I have woken up more than once next to a woman and thought 💭 what in the hell was I thinking 🤔!!! Of course the heavy drinking might have had an effect on my decision making as well as the thick makeup 💄 that the girl was wearing.",2022-09-02 23:38:51

So she broke my water, and said, “I’m going to go to sleep for 3 hours and then check on you.” I was like, “PLEASE don’t take a nap! Check on me after 20 minutes!” The baby was basically out by the time she got back from her nap. She took a quick look and was like, “Oh, wow! The baby is right there!” 🙄😑",2020-06-27 03:10:05

The ultrasound tech was 60 and she was telling me how she remembered getting to watch someone else learn how to use it at the time. 

Also made me realise before ultrasounds we probably didn't have any great frame of watching a heart beat from the inside. Like surgery isn't a natural heart beat not can you really see it when it's dissected. X-rays wouldn't show you much. Like to have that full picture ... 🤯",2023-10-04 08:31:25

But hey if they don't mind, then that's alright. I still get my food, with or without their regulations.

1c10scy,"Not just Florida. Pretty much all the high-agriculture states run off of slave labor and wouldn't survive without it. Like the fact that America wouldn't be able to feed itself if we actually enforced our own minimum wage laws across the entire labor market is a fucking disgrace.


But my absolute favorite Florida agriculture fact is that a few decades ago they were warned that the citrus greening blight could annihilate their citrus industry, and their response was basically ""public health measures are for liberal homos, we got this 😎"" and they did exactly as much as they're doing now to confront rising sea levels, which is nothing. 


Meanwhile, California did the scaredy-cat liberal pussy thing and let their environmental scientists organize defensive measures 


[Let's see how that worked out for them.](https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/26738/florida-california-orange-crop/)

1bspzid,"You know, can I just say? I had a cat, her name was mama. She passed away almost 2 years ago. She lived to almost 22 years old. I moved away from home many years ago from a childhood of turmoil and pretty bad depression, and my grandpa took care of her. I visited her from time to time still when I could, but she was getting so weak and frail. She would mao SO loud when she realized you came over, and would run as fast as her body would allow her. She wasn't a normal cat, she was full of love and cuddles and intelligence to understand words like I'd never seen. Felt more human than cat. I knew I wanted to visit her before she passed. I knew it was coming soon. But when I got the news.. I just.. had too much in my life. I'd been struggling for years. I never saw her one last time before she passed. And I carry so much guilt that I never saw her one last time before she passed. It had been many months since my last visit. And this video... with them calling her mama... god... that guilt came flooding back 😢",2024-04-01 02:48:57

Blood will tell 😁😁 So he was one of the bonded/indentured servants (paid for their passage with an amount of time working for their boss - no the Irish weren't effing slaves, that misinformation propaganda makes me mad. Indentured servitude is absolutely no picnic, sure, but they weren't effing chattel, property, livestock like those stolen or traded for from Africa) and after working his contract saved enough to buy his wife/wife-to-be's freedom? Or his daughter? (you said great-grandad and then grandma and I don't know if the latter was a typo)",2021-09-04 10:10:59
phha25,"Depends on the shade of red, and the level of freckles. And the age/maturity of the observer. Dark Titian or chestnut hair is much admired by adults, though I still got plenty of slagging for it in school. Would kill to still have that hair colour now as an adult - and going by the number of women that colour their hair various tones and shades of redhead many other people want it too -  but long before I started to go grey my hair started darkening from light chestnut, to the exact colour of a conker, to a dark chestnut, to a deep warm brown. And now it's just a dark nothing brown with a load of grey in it and I hate it 🙁

Bright, carroty, ""ginger"", orangey hair isn't much admired on anyone, though I think that's because it's often a mass of frizzy, unconditioned curls and also often comes with pale skin with a million really dark and obvious freckles. So it's the whole package that's less admired rather than just the hair. Bright orangey red hair will definitely get you slagged at school.

Annoyingly though, we have picked up/been contaminated a lot in the last 20 years by British attitudes to and terms for redheads. In my growing up it was never referred to as ginger, and while kids might slag you (I got called Duracel a lot, ""the battery with the copper coloured top) 20-somethings and older wouldn't. But nowadays there's more ""Ugh, gingers, not even once"", especially about blokes, among the 20-30 something age group than there ever was, and that's directly imported from England where to be ginger is a very bad thing generally.",2021-09-04 09:08:17
phha25,Is this because of the premise Gingers (red heads) have no soul ....🤣,2021-09-04 09:53:11

phha25,You must not live in the US 😂,2021-09-04 08:07:21
phha25,"Huh, I wouldn't have thought indentured servants were paid, but I guess being contracted to an employer with absolutely no ability to move or change employer for 10 years would be enough indenture, even if you were getting a pittance of money.

But that's so interesting that you were able to track all that information 😊",2021-09-04 10:18:40
phha25,"There's a LOT of redheads in Iceland as well, probably stemming from our celtic genes from way back when 😊",2021-09-04 08:40:25
phha25,"Course not, why would they keep any kind of records of livestock other than sales contracts /s 😒

But if you have name, age, part of Ireland your g-grandfather came from you could trace him and his family further back here. You could even hire a genealogist to do some investigating for you, for things like church records where they might need to go to physical archives. But even just online archives where you need a paid subscription; a professional genealogist would have subscriptions to several services, and paying them to search would be cheaper (and easier, because they know how to do it efficiently) than paying for several subscriptions yourself.

Doesn't help much for finding the African side of your family, but better than a slap in the face with a wet fish 😕",2021-09-04 10:32:02

Which leads to my next topic of conversation where i usually lose most people, and that is that I am convinced that our technological breakthroughs in the second half of the 1900s were due to reverse engineering of alien tech, à la area 51. 👽",2022-11-17 21:27:11

yxzux4,"Honestly I believe our world governments have made breakthroughs that would blow our mind and challenge our understanding of the world around us.

I read somewhere that our technology should be MUCH more advanced than what we have access to at the present time. I can’t list specific links or anything but I remember reading that we are nearly 100 years behind in our technological advancement.

We are still using 100 year old engines to drive to work everyday. Sure our vehicles are much fancier than the old model-T’s but it is still a gasoline engine designed basically the same and not even capable of 50+mpg’s.

Where’s the guy that made that car that ran 100 miles with a gallon of water?

Tesla and electric cars are not the answer, lithium mining is just as terrible for our planet as burning fossil fuels. 

Corporations, banks and oil companies all controlled by a single entity all the way at the top. It’s not even conspiracy! It’s there, they don’t hide we just don’t want to see. Tik-Tok, politics, war over religion, whose gonna be the next president and make things “so much better” , the mainstream media. We don’t want to see it because CONSUMING SHIT FEELS GOOD. 

I truly believe the next step towards technology that will end world hunger, end all wars, stop all the hate, is already here and the only way we are going to get to it is so fucking simple it’s dumb.

We all have to actually want it. We have to open up our hearts and advance spiritually to the next level! 

And that is already happening I see it all around me I see it in my children. The hippies in the 60’s were right, the world is going to change dramatically when we learn to love ourselves and the world around us with our whole hearts ❤️",2022-11-18 05:14:22

Usually these “others” don’t even talk to women and are upset they can’t even say hi to them. It’s wild. 

If you were going to make a “MeToo” statement... how about you talk about the fact, it started because a single victim coming forward usually wasn’t enough because of victim blaming (like your statement) & then it took a team of people admitting they were hurt/abused for it to even be heard, let alone for the abuser to be prosecuted. It’s sad really... that your comment on the movement makes it sound like you side with the abuser. Worse yet, almost, is the fact it sounds as if you’re jealous of this man who’s a true hero & in order to make yourself feel better because you could never do anything in the cave in which you live, that’s even half as brilliant & selfless as this man, you have to bring up a completely different discussion that still manages to make you be an asshat.",2020-11-28 03:58:30

you are correct, I used it out of context. Which I did on purpose so you couldn’t be confused and think I was being serious. You then go on to use quotation marks as if I‘m actually thinking those things, however it’s something you have made up in your head based on a comment you haven’t understood.

\>Imagine how tired victims are of experiencing trauma over & over again & being fearful of their abuser, to only have others belittle them. Usually these “others” don’t even talk to women and are upset they can’t even say hi to them. It’s wild.

The only people being belittled in my comment are liars. Any abused woman or man reading my comment would hopefully understand context and therefore know it’s not about them.

\>If you were going to make a “MeToo” statement... how about you talk about the fact

this wasn’t a #metoo statement. Nor was it a statement at all. Which I honestly thought was so obvious! And because it wasn’t a statement it explains why I wouldn’t talk about the facts.

I’m not going to respond to the rest of your comment because, to be honest, it makes me a little sick and it depresses me how other people can jump behind you and not see the fatal mistakes you have made. This highlights mob mentality.

I dunno if you’ll see your mistakes but all I hope is that you don’t go around making people villains because you have a bad habit of projecting and assuming.

You’re playing a dangerous games.  


Just in case you still don’t understand it and would like more insight, I’ll explain.

The original post was designed for likes. It’s that simple.

My comment was simply mocking this reddit mentality, in the ""meme"" description they mention the coworker was a girl. It helps pray on the ""knight/damsel"" narrative that most people have grew up on.

My comments purpose was to create a silly sketch in people’s imaginations where after being saved by this heroic man this woman then sues him for sexual harassment. I remember when it was okay to make jokes. I even remember when people understood jokes. Now you can go on and say that tired quote of ""well if you have to explain it""

But the truth is I don’t have to explain it. A lot of people understood my comment. However as reddit has gotten more popular the average iq has dropped. Which is exactly why we see more of these ""posts for likes"" memes that pray on people’s good nature and usually was reserved for Facebook.

I will concede that me adding #metoo did nothing for my comment. But even added, it did not deserve such a response.

a joke is a joke is a joke is a joke. Nothing is safe from being made fun off. Such is the nature of a joke. If you really can’t agree with this than you’re on the wrong side of civil rights.

sincerely have a nice day and consider learning more about the nuances of the language you speak.

Yes, I think visiting North Korea is a one time thing for me. I am cautious when it comes to Iran and other places like that, but I don’t worry too much - most of those countries still allow journalists (and I am but a meesly hobby photographer) but again, there’s always high risks with travelling to places like these.

All in all, great question 😂",2023-03-31 19:35:55
127mq17,"Honestly great question. I seriously, seriously had some moral qualms over it, and still do. 

So I paid a tour company. They’re a company run by wonderful people based out of China who do fantastic work that respects North Korea and China. The level of professionalism they showed was impressive. I realize a fair part of that money is going to North Korea, and overall, I think I’m fine with it. For these reasons:

1. By visiting a place like North Korea, where they are banned from seeing anything in the outside world, we can help show examples to the local people that we aren’t like how their leaders and propaganda portray us. We can help challenge that. Many people in North Korea are aware of their unfortunate reality, and the more exposure they get, hopefully it can’t inspire some change, even if only so small. Of course this is wishful thinking, but still.
2. Our guides! Lovely, lovely people who are genuinely proud of the real fascinating Korean culture that can be found in their country. We were able to visit many old temples and statues of the Koryo dynasty, and it was incredibly informative. Plus, our guides are regular people. We enjoyed chatting with them, sharing little bits of “appropriate” talk as much as we could with them, and them genuinely being curious, informed, well balanced people. We’re able to give them tips for their families, and money to help out.
3. The money is a blip in comparison, and while I know that this is the same excuse as “well I can litter cause the planets doomed”, I still stand by it 😂. North Korea gets a substantial amount of money doing cheap labour for China, while also exporting recreational drugs to the world, primarily meth. The… 2k CAD (if I recall) is small, and it’s not like tourism is a booming industry for them haha.
4. I’ve read so many books about North Korea from escapes and historians over the years. I was a history undergrad, and that background, morphed with my love of travel, kinda made it hard not to want to explore first hand. Yes, that is selfish, but it’s how we learn about the world. I don’t agree with MANY of the governments I travel to or contribute money to indirectly by visiting their nations.

Again. It’s not like it was easy, and I still wonder and question my intentions. That said, I’m proud of the images and story’s I can share, and at least there is that.",2023-04-01 02:57:18

14ntmqp,"Back in my hometown, had a black fella lived across the pasture from us, a doctor. He always had really cool animals as pets, but had a terrible trouble with keeping em all on his land, which was a damn good time for us kids lol. 

He'd have ostriches, peacocks, and a platypus would get loose and get on our land, and I perfected the peacocks call lol. There were more than a seldom time that one would fly past us in the dark, and it would light a fire under your ass, something the big flying past you in the dark in the woods is akin to a winged wendigo 😂 

I visited home recently, and his old house is abandoned, I sometimes wondered what might have happened to him.",2023-07-01 19:02:53

14ntmqp,"We had quite a few peacocks of different varieties at the old small zoo where I would volunteer. They were oftentimes free to roam around and do as they please.  I believe they trimmed the peacocks primary feathers to keep them from flying away. In the Springtime, it was interesting to sit outside on one of the benches that were on all of the winding paths in the zoo and watch the beautiful male peacocks displaying and shaking their tail feathers to attract the plain old brown females. 9 times out of 10 the females would just nonchalantly go about their business and just ignore the males and their showy theatrics as if they were completely disinterested and bored, no matter how hard some of the males tried. They still were able to fly around a little bit with their primary feathers trimmed. They were big on leaping up on top of the fences and then emitting that awful scream/cry that they do - which I still dislike to this day. They could leap and fly short distances, though, so I saw a lot of that. Once in a blue moon, one would escape and fly away somewhere, though, but many of them returned back later on.  🦚",2023-07-02 00:19:51

If the degree is a perquisite to studying medicine then that's another thing like having to take a biology degree or some foundation classes then that's justified but if you have the freedom to have any degree just to follow the rules, like economy then I don't see a benefit of that!

In my country, you just can go from high school directly to medicine but the college itself is 7.5 years just to have a bachelor then there is residency,... You know. There was an older system that forces you study a year in science college. This system also changed to be five years of study then two years of training to get your bachelor. The older was 6.5 years study and a one for training. Medicine sucks 😂",2020-01-24 19:30:15

My place has a ton of light, lots of trees outside. Sometimes there are monkeys in the trees, jumping from branch to branch and hooting. 🐒 

The thing about the place in the photo is that it takes a ton of upkeep to look that nice. You can visit but you can't stay. Get used to a bit of dust and some leaves on the ground and see how far the same $1400/nt takes you!",2019-12-13 01:46:14

In the end though it won't last. The words/ideas of those same people that have catalysed this deception will still be there when he's alone, and he won't *be* happy regardless of however happy he *looks*. 

This lacks any real strength and gives too much power to the thoughts/ideas belonging to the shallowest members of society... but if you want to celebrate that, go ahead.

17l2ojn,"That’s great but we all need to realize one thing. Help must be VOLUNTARY. Knowing that support networks are important but then demanding that others be forced to “give” against their will, is NOT a laudable position. 

I say this because people hear words as Arnold has spoken here, and then think that that gives a collective of people the right to legislate for the “common good” even if it means destroying individual liberty. 

So yes, help, be there, lend your time and talents. It takes a village. But it takes a village that also respects individual freedom. I believe it was also Arnold who later replied: “Screw your freedom”, in response to those that didn’t want to wear masks or take vaccines during Covid. 🤷🏻‍♂️",2023-11-02 01:11:43

rkl9hl,">	Bartram told a newspaper: “Some of the photographs were truly ugly, too ugly to present the owners of the faces to the public. One among them suggested what may sound like a paradox, the face of an ugly woman that was not unpleasant.”

>	That photograph was of Mary Ann Bevan, from Deptford, taken especially so she could answer the advert.

>	Little did she know at the time that that photograph, **the first she ever had taken in her life**, would dramatically change her fortune and make her well known, not only along the South Coast, but across the rest of the country and on the other side of the Atlantic.

If the photo she took for the contest was the “first of her life”, then how do these articles claim to have a photo of her when she was young and more conventionally attractive?… 🤔",2021-12-20 20:38:24

There was a medium-small one on the street in front of our house a month back just walking in endless circles.

1aznfau,"There aren't really any collections of morality lessons that are going to be reliable on every front 🤷‍♀️ and you don't want people to learn morality by rote anyway. 

The Bible was written by people who understood that it would be read by educated people, people who were familiar with metaphor and knew how to recognize symbolism. People who would see ""you'll burn in the lake of fire forever"" and understand that that isn't real, and it's a metaphorical way of saying ""that path leads to suffering.""

The kind of biblical literalism that you're citing is a fairly  recent phenomenon and it seems weird to me to judge the value of a book based on how people who willingly ignore reality will read it. Like some people think Animal Farm is about animals on a farm but that's not the measure it should be judged by if you know better.",2024-02-25 22:20:44

Also imma go off a bit further with my theory.
Also milennials grew up with, for example, shows like pokemon, dragonball, and spiderman. Shows where a male protagonist is the hero but at the same time caring, showing emotions, empathic human beings. 
Lord of the rings??? Friggin fighting macho men that show so much love for their brothers in arms openly.

Comparing these heroes in media compared to 80s and earlier. 80s, terminator, Rambo, Demolition man, A-Team, all these over macho stone cold killer action heroes where we see little to no emotions from. Earlier than that Cowboys was the shit, same concept there stone cold cowboys that are macho af and shoot first ask questions later.

>You obviously don't know about what the Hindu extremists are doing in India right now, literally terrorising the Muslim population.

Sure I wouldn't know it, having lived in india for my entire life. 

I'm sure special reservation, special religious laws, special Succession rights and status, special land reservation etc are all signs of terrorizing. 

And the years of invasions, massacres, and slavery carried out by Islamics in india was all justified. 

Muslims Literally rape and kill hindu women in india in the name of love jihad and rarely see any violence against them, and even if they do, they quickly mob up and resort to extremism. They've commited several violent riots all across the country whenever their sacred ""islamist laws"" have been taken down. And when the current government is successfully doing it today they're called oppressors. 

You're the kind of people who hide behind the name of minority and secularism while committing heinous crimes against humanity and following a tainted ideology. 

Not to mention Islam specifically States to kill all infidels while almost all of the eastern polytheistic religions like Hinduism and Buddhism are pluralistic and have never in history have once waged a single holy war or tried to convert others to their faiths while abrahamic religions both Islam and Christianity has declared jihads and crusades over the years and wiped out several cultures and religions off the fucking planet.

mxtyfs,"Late response, but from my own experience they usually have around a 10 year old’s amount of insight into things, but have to work with the vocabulary of about a six year old to articulate it. Granted, my brother just turned 13, so these age estimates could improve. Basically their ideas usually exceed their vocabulary, so you have to help them find the words to express themselves at times, but they understand a lot more than they’re able to immediately articulate off hand. 

Does that make any sense? I am having trouble articulating the concept, and the irony is not lost on me. 😂",2021-05-05 03:31:22

 No one who has more than 5 brain cells thinks the people who keep society running (people who pack our food, pick our food, sell our food, keep our streets clean, take care of children and so on) is ""unskilled"".    


Capitalists and their boot lickers are just disgusting human beings and anyone packing avocados is 1000% more worth than them.

1csa3hx,"Jobs like that can actually be pretty fun when you get ""in the zone"". I have done a little packing at a shipping warehouse before and that particular part of the job was pretty sweet actually. If that kind of thing paid more then it wouldn't be a bad gig at all, imo. I didn't stick with it as long as I did Pizza delivery, because pizza delivery paid a lot better. But the things I liked about pizza delivery (doing dishes in the back and cleaning the store at closing hour after the dinner rush made me my $$$) were very similar to the things I liked about the shipping warehouse.

The problem with min wage jobs is usually everything *except* the labor: money/status/opportunities/paths to success. I'd be happy to move boxes or whatever all day (or until I needed a break, hehe) for $20/hour, part time, whenever I need money or want some more exercise, provided I can leave on short notice as soon as an opportunity more aligned with my life goals presents itself. 

It's never the labor that's the problem. Manual labor is actually a pretty good time. It's the *job* part of it that sucks, and the *job* part of it usually pays very poorly and is not flexible. I would rather buy some boxes at my own expense and move them around my backyard for exercise than get paid slightly more than nothing to go do the same in a ""work environment"" that comes with so much baggage (schedule dictation, piss tests, office politics for good or ill, and the generally large impact that a job has on your life which in these cases is usually not proportional to the pay unless that pay is the  difference between starvation and a full belly). If I could just show up at random job sites and do a day's labor for a day's pay with no fuss then I would do that all the time. But applying for even a minimum wage temp gig is like getting married there is so much paperwork and red tape. 🤷",2024-05-15 15:48:18

11oklqe,"Mean brothers club unite ✊

My brother is a fucking asshole!!! but our mom was always of the opinion that ""you have to always love him because he's your brother"", the hell I do! 

This fucker terrorized me and wanted nothing to do with me, we didn't play together, and he never acted like he even liked me unless he needed something. 

He was either doing something mean to me, shit like he'd chase me around the yard and throw spears made from mop handles at me, as a teenager he beat the crap out of me, he'd pin me down and spit in my face, he kicked my bedroom door down, he did a belly flop on my daybed AND trundle bed, wrecking and collapsing them both. 

He borrowed (and would keep) thousands of dollars worth of new digital camera equipment that when forced to return would be broken and unusable, he stole and gave away a treasured amber and silver ring I owned that had a gnat in it I had bought in the Czech Republic and had researched the crap out of where to buy it to make sure I was buying a real piece, and the list goes on and on. 

We don't speak anymore, and I'm absolutely fine with that, and from what our mother tells me, he's still an asshole.",2023-03-11 17:01:28

11tcc8a,"What’s the source version of an ad hominem attack?  Make sure you’re so consistent in your academic rigor when Anytown or Mothers Demand Action are referenced as well.  🤣

If you think DGU are accurately reported then you’re welcome to do that. However, if you talk to any social worker ask them: 

1. How likely is it that a lower to middle class person to voluntarily engage with the police and provide them information that might get them in trouble? 

2. Does that willingness to volunteer information to the police go up or down as one goes lower in the economic system?

3.  Does the likelihood to be attacked and need to defend themselves go up or down as one goes lower in the economic system.  

With that information… if you can’t infer that the official metrics and the reality on the ground likely differ… well… that’s some significant cognitive disability or cognitive dissonance being displayed.",2023-03-17 23:25:25

Each order (sorry if I'm getting the taxonomy wrong) is more or less used to the availability of food in its habitat, but, assuming these really catch on on a mass scale, food will become much more available. Could that potentially harm birds?

Also... How do seagulls add into this equation? 🙈",2022-01-27 07:10:55

Whisky, made in Scotland🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿, is properly spelled without the ‘e.’ Whiskey, made in anywhere else, like US or Ireland, for starters, is properly spelled ‘whiskey,’ with the ‘e.’ Yup.

I’m not a whiskey (or a whisky) snob, I just don’t have that kind of $$ unfortunately. I was brought up by a teacher-mom and a sci-fi loving dad who both enjoyed their Johnnie Walker.

So here I am. I can’t - and won’t - make apologies for myself. At least, not about this. 😉

We then took this little river boat down a major river (i don't remember its name) for a while then turned up a little, winding river barely wider than creek. We had to stop for the night. We had a most spectacular cloud to cloud lighting display.

Next morning, we had breakfast n the boat, we made it to Camp Leakey, in in the Tanjung Puting National Park. I was hoping to meet Dr. Biruté Galdikas but she was not there at the time. 

Amazing place. We took a several hour hike around the center through the rainforest. We got to see actual wild orangutans. The Center is an orangutan research and rehabilitation facility. During one of the talks a female with baby came up to me and wanted grooming, so I did. 

In the afternoon after lunch we got to wander about abs see the facility and ask questions etc, or just enjoy the place. I saw some babi hutan, basically a wild forest pig but very strange looking. I also saw a mature male sitting just beyond a clearing near one of the buildings is the brush. I went and sat next to him for a bit. He didn't pay me much attention, a little but not much. He was HUGE!

In the late afternoon we started heading back. Again we stopped for the night. I contracted malaria this trip. Didn't know until a few months later. It started after I came off my motorcycle while driving in the outskirts of Jakarta and smacked my abdomen, specifically my liver. I also learned the importance of wearing gloves. Ouch!

Anywho, Dr. Biruté Galdikas is one of the three women doing primate research, also with Drs. Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey. She's not as famous because no one has made a movie about her work, which is just as important and fascinating as the others. 

If you ever get the chance to go DO NOT miss it. ❤",2024-02-14 20:24:37

But back then we had orangutans without protection or anything when we were kids and we could take pictures with them, I’ve never ever heard an issue maybe cause I’ve never looked into it but the only issue i got to hear was because of a mexican comedical show that interacts with fans when it’s live and one told the the shorty and brief story of how one slapped the back of his head 😂 he’s fine but hahahah",2024-02-14 18:00:42

yhqoiz,"First congratulations on your amazing transformation! I just want to respond to ‘surgery being the easy way out’… I had the sleeve done 10 years ago. I was at my wits end after losing 50 then gaining 65, etc. my whole life. I couldn’t lose weight permanently. Whether it be a psychological issues (food is my friend….) or the wrong diet plan. As my weight crept up to 289 (size 24) I became pre diabetic, had severe sleep apnea and back pain. It was not magic or a quick-fix, every day I work at it. I just had the excess skin removed, again, after trying everything on my own. I wish I could say that ‘I got it’ like you did but by 53 years old I didn’t get it. After recovering from the weight loss surgery and now tummy tuck my hope for anyone struggling to lose and keep it off do exactly what you did. Starting out as a teen and being put on amphetamines by a ‘diet doctor’ in the  70’’s I guess weight problems was the least of my worries. From then on for another decade I used pills to drop weight. So unhealthy. Very sad. My mom didn’t realize what had happened after that one doctor. From 1975 to 2022 it cost me. Now I eat very healthy, know what foods trigger over-eating and will finally have a flat tummy again. (Haven’t had that since before my daughters were born in the 90’s) My motto - it’s never too late to save a life. Especially if it’s your own. God bless! ❤️💕",2022-11-12 10:35:21

Honestly for me it's about the size of the animal and the Damage it can do. I was fishing with a friend and he pulled up about a 4 ft dogfish. I thought that was pretty awesome. Obviously we put it back. I also love horses! But I'm also a bit afraid of horses. They are freaking huge, and if they decided they wanted to hurt me, they definitely could. I'm not saying they would! But my brain recognizes that they are physically capable, and this little Caution alarm goes off

With sharks it is even one step further, I'm in the water where I can manage myself just fine but I'm wildly less capable than I am in my own environment. Where is the shark is on top of his game. Maybe if I had the balls to go swimming with some of the non-lethal sharks it might make me a little more at ease",2023-08-07 16:29:57

Yes, MRIs are in fact very real. No, wearing magnets won't ""cure"" you of anything or have any effect other than placebo (if that, honestly).

""Alternative medicine"" is not medicine. It's just bunk.

They said that they had never done that for anyone before.  I found that surprising, as we live in a community with ship building and oil-rig working.  Many refineries nearby.  So many metal workers here.  X-ray showed no radio-opaque bodies in my eyes.  🤞",2023-11-17 00:34:17

About 2 moths after we started hangin out she said “I have some things to tell you, I’ve done ‘x, y & z’ in my past but I’m clean now and will never be that person again.” I remember thinking 😬 if she woulda told me that 2 months ago I would have probably cut and run but I already decided I liked her so it didn’t matter!  Anyways, we’re married with 2 kids now and she still kicks ass!

Yepp... that's his channel... If you have an issue with hearing from the underbelly of society I highly suggest you stay a way from a channel that does exactly that.

18cahiv,"It's just pattern recognition. If you have a sensitive enough nose and there's something to detect, with enough experience you will associate it with illnesses. Some doctors and nurses talk about noticing a certain smell before patients pass and I believe that, based on my personal experience.

There's a smell some elderly and sick people have in the months preceding their passing. It's hard to describe. I'm thinking it has to do with their metabolism or maybe some function/system is failing and giving off atypical levels of or types of waste product or byproduct. 

It's not a good time to smell these things on your loved ones. 😳 But at least you have some warning?

Diabetes, when not fully controlled, has a certain smell. You can tell how well somebody has been eating. It can be very subtle or very in your face.

I've noticed a certain smell related to a mental health disorder, but it may just be related to that specific family. Some medicines will make people have a certain scent, so maybe they were on the same medicine.",2023-12-06 23:25:11

She can smell other diseases, actually! Not that that makes it a much better super power 😅 but after she realized she could smell Parkinson’s they started doing tests with her on other diseases.

18cahiv,"Some people can detect certain scents, my favorite is during an autopsy if you smell bitter almond I believe it's arsenic in the body... Could be another poison - either way, it's not something that is normally tested for.  A lot of perfumers have a heightened sense of smell, but this is crazy unique.  Same with taste 🤷‍♀️",2023-12-06 22:05:12

He's a mechanic and we'll be driving behind someone and he'll diagnose their car on the smell of the exhaust. Thank god I'm not a smelly person or I'd be constantly paranoid. 😂

There was a science fiction novel written in the 70's, where the end of the world came about because a scientist released a virus that increased humans' sense of smell to the level of a dog pretty much instantly, and people go insane. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telempath

>Isham has been told by his father, scientist Jacob Stone, that Carlson is a madman who brought the world to its current state by releasing a ""hyperosmic plague"": a virus that increases the sensitivity of the human sense of smell by many hundred times. With their senses of smell thus heightened, humans were unable to tolerate the odors produced by their own pollution-producing technology; the result was mass insanity and widespread rioting.",2023-12-06 23:28:10

The dog/cat would always hangout with whoever was ""next to go"" all day long regardless of whether they were watching t.v. or eating in the cafeteria or in their room. Soon after it had correctly predicted 3 or 4 people passing away the residents lost it from the paranoia dreading who the dog/cat would sit by next and the staff had to remove it from the nursing home to calm things down. Imagining the next level terror of who's lap the dog/cat would sit on next had me giggling a bit but if I were there in that scenerio it'd scare me half to death too 😂",2023-12-20 23:38:50

The problem is that most circular polarising filters (for digital cameras, and 3D cinema glasses, for example) actually consist of a circular polariser combined with a linear polariser. It's all a bit confusing (to me).

So you might actually be right - you might actually be able to get the effect in the video using a certain combination of linear and circular polarising filters. But I'm not sure.

I might try r/askscience

dn5vof,"I agree, inequality in general is so much worse than most people realize and there's plenty of information that proves it. So, where to start?

[The ultra-rich are hoarding as much as $32 trillion ($32,000,000,000,000) in offshore accounts to avoid taxes.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth-idUSBRE86L03U20120722) As a way to understand just how much 32 trillion is, let's use time as an example. One million seconds is 12 days, and one billion seconds is 31.7 years. That's already a massive difference between a million and a billion, but how much is 32 trillion seconds? It's over a million years.

Most people know that wealth inequality is a huge issue, but they don't understand just how bad it is. Here's an example: **If you had a job that paid you $2,000 an hour, and you worked full time (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much money as Jeff Bezos.**

I've been researching this issue for years because I was shocked at just how bad it really is, and I've put together some information to help illustrate it.

>**""Capitalism as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of evils.

>**""If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution.

dn5vof,"It’d be good for you to distinguish capitalism as an economic principle vs socialism as a political one, so that you don’t go thinking they are opposite or can’t coexist. A country can have capitalism as its core economic principle, allowing for private ownership and accumulation of capital to be used in a free market, while politically having the socialist ideology that the collective wealth, judicial and legislative policy of the nation should prioritize social well-being and provide goods or services that the private sector wouldn’t because it wouldn’t generate enough ROI; like roads, schools, security and infrastructure that should be available to all equally as well as a level playing field in the application of laws. 

And these can exist in nations with diverse system for designating leaders or representatives: direct democracy, representative democracy, parliamentary monarchy, etc.   

So, capitalism and socialism can and do successfully coexist in modern democracies - and the 20th century United States is a very visible tho often overlooked example of the very thing simply because god forbid we call the entire federal and state owned public works and services like fire or police departments, schools, colleges, military, roads, dams, parks, agencies, etc. socialist.

ywb8t5,">*'We need a world full of more Fridas. Rip sweet soul.*'

______

there's souls that are selfless who walk among men,

...some never notice....

 Some call them 'best friend'...

some never are lucky enough to have known

the Love of a Dog -

one that they call 'their own'

no matter their size, if they're big or they're small,

you're blessed with a Dog

who loves You *Best* of all

sadly, their time is too short here on earth,

but Nothing compares 

to the Joy

that they're worth

She plays the girlfriend of the main character’s son. I didn’t even recognize her until I saw it for a second time! She has dark hair and is a European model. After about 30 minutes of scratching my head and wracking my brain, I recognized her eyes and said That’s Brienne of Tarth!!! Holy shit she looks different off a horse and with no body armor on. She was really great as the sexually charged girlfriend. There’s even a scene of her getting head, from her boyfriend, in his mother’s home, while the mom is still there. I’d recommend the movie for her and the witches storyline alone! She’s beautiful in both roles 😍",2021-11-23 03:22:56

We know as viewers Tormund had some redeeming qualities such as being a loyal friend to Jon, etc. To Brienne's character he was just some creep staring at her. 

It was a funny gag at first, but the showrunners sure leaned into it.

They know how to fade/layer the hair unlike most.
They don't force back hairline and create weird ass regrowth patterns.
They took care in what looked like checking with the lad on length of things snd working with them on comfort zones / acceptable lengths etc.

Too often yourself people just going for it with Barbers/Hairdresser and it shows woth a lot of people.

Some styff you'll only notice if you've been in the environment from a work stand point or around those that are in a decent plsce for a while like body language , way they go about the cut etc.

Well done the stylist for that level of care and consideration and the guy having the fresh do is looking sharp 👌",2023-05-26 06:40:53

1c3hlpx,"My guess is that in perhaps 1 or 2 million years more, chimps will go from just Stone Age technology and hunter gathering to perhaps farming and making actual huts for the first time so that they perhaps a few thousand years later(depending on how long it takes for them to just find copper) can enter their own Copper Age(once they find copper and start realizing its uses and how it can help them improve so that they start mining it en masse and start mass producing copper bars), and eventually their Bronze Age, Iron Age and so on.

Just like us. This is something other species might do as well if they get the chance and if they develop the required intellect, drive and instincts to do so. 

And it all seems to depend on whether they figure out how to make fire and how to control it and not fear it when it’s controlled and that you can use fire as a source of warmth that will keep you warm on cold nights or during a cold day and to cook with it, and that it’s a prerequisite in order to figure out how to develop electric technology. And developing an oral language and an alphabet helps enormously.

If they get to stay around for that long that is and don’t get extinct somehow. 

God, I hope they stay around for that long and prove it true because then they will be the second animal on Earth to enter true agriculture(but on the other hand, ants are already using a form of agriculture, which is really impressive, but they’re tiny so they’re different in that regard, but it’s still worth noting), and eventual proper civilisation, potentially the first Chimpanzee Kingdom, whatever it will be called, after which many others will follow, with their own laws and values.

If they get to their iron age, it’s possible they will enter their own ”medieval period” or feudal era rather, however that one will look and how similar or different it will be to our own, if they will start their own religions, thus their own religious crusades potentially(not saying that’s a good thing, just that there is a risk; but wars can happen and have happened regardless of religion - look at the USSR for instance), what they will learn from their past and how they move forward to a better future(like we did), how long it will take for them to enter their own Renaissance, their own colonial era, their own Age of Enlightenment, their own Golden Age of Piracy even(who knows?), their own industrial period(possibly two like it was for us?), and eventually their own Space Age, and them forming their own kingdoms and nations, republics perhaps, and so on.

Right now all of this seems extremely unlikely to ever happen. But then it might suddenly happen(suddenly as in over the course of some hundred thousand years or a million years or more depending on various factors) against all odds, a million years or more into the future. Evolution is not set to go down a single route as if all species are destined to end up making their own civilisations one day when they get advanced enough. But all it takes is the right set of steps and then they’re there, just like we were. At that point it’s not just theoretical or hypothetical. At that point it becomes proof of concept. Then we will no longer be the outliers, the exception. Look at chimps and certain monkeys(not apes) like macaques. They’re in their own stone age. 

So who’s to say that with time they won’t make their own actual ”advanced(to them)” stone age tools later down the road, as opposed to rudimentary sharpened stones, or huts and eventually proper houses, just because it is not immediately apparent right now? If nothing else, it’s at least an idea that’s fun to humor and actually consider.

Question is, if it does happen in 1 or 2 million years(or whenever), where and what will we be in that time? Will we still be primarily humans and some cyborgs/androids, or will we be predominantly cyborgs/androids with the regular humans in minority? 

No doubt we will probably be a Type 3 Civilisation by that point, or at the very least a Type 2 Civ, according to the Kardashev Scale, and we will probably have colonized/settled thousands of star systems with the aid of the tech we will have had for a million years by that time.

Exciting to think about.

On a final note, one thing that’s unlikely though is for crocodilians such as crocodiles and alligators to make their own civilisations(at least it seems inconceivable currently), considering crocodiles and alligators and other crocodilians such as caymans, have remained pretty much the same for over 200 million years, and might remain that way for another 200 million years, unless something drastic happens that forces them to adapt and evolve physically to the point that a civilisation becomes far more likely for them in the distant future. 

Nature and evolution seems to work in such a way that revolves around the idea of ”If it ain’t broke, there’s no need to fix it”. Crocodilians are perfect for their habitat so them crawling up from the waters to start making houses seems both extremely unlikely, unnecessary but at the same time hilarious.

I just picture a bipedal croc in the Australian outbacks in a Crocodile Dundee hat and an Aussie accent saying ”Hi mate. Mind if you lend me a hand?” 😂

188vabu,"It needs to get smaller and more comfortable. The XR Real glasses look very cool, but maybe still too experimental. I’d get those if I had the new iPhone since it just plugs right in. https://www.xreal.com/air2/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKurBhD5ARIsALamXaHIXk_lLMCb9SkUAiehP_RtQJxqWC8-KLpOi6qED1FoFlYV_gXjhEoaAhFSEALw_wcB

So I had a quest 1 years ago and I didn’t use it much for the same reasons you mentioned. Especially getting sick. 

But with mixed reality instead of virtual, I’m still in my room and I don’t get sick at all. I keep it in pass through mode all the time. Pass through is significantly better now and the screens are way more high resolution. The headbands are much better too and I’m not worried about my hair at all. Plus, I often use it while lying back which case there’s no tension. 

In mixed reality, I can literally grab the hologram like it’s an iPad with my bare hand while my other hand uses the touch screen. Even without controllers. Check out some of the videos people posted in the oculus quest subreddits. It’s hard to really understand even from those videos, but it’s really gotten to the point where it might be the best way to consume media now. IMO at least so, salt grains 😂

1byzhp5,"That was the intent behind it. It was tried in Tokio and Hamburg, too. A big „problem“ with previous firebombings was that they weren’t quite as effective as was hoped. The fires burnt out too quickly and used up all oxygen too quickly, in essence suffocating themselves. 

So here it was tried to create some large, concentrated fires that would create their own chimney effect and basically kept feeding themselves by sucking in the surrounding air. And it worked almost too well. Unlike normal fires burning, those were hotter and ate up the oxygen so fast, people who stood further off were either sucked in, cooked or suffocated. 

Basically nothing inside the city could survive. They burned out faster but much, much more destructive. 

Personally, for me, those were much much more horrible bombings then the nuclear bombs. Those at least killed you fast. (Excluding radiation poisoning of course and flash burns). 

Gotta give it to humanity. We got the science of killing each other down pat. 🥲",2024-04-08 18:59:16

There’s 8 billion+ people on this planet… Even just a low percentage of douche bags, is still a shit load of people. 

If you really think about it, though, most people are cool.

19cynj3,"Seems like most people with these kinds of eyes are always shown or seen with tiny pupils, which is what makes me suspect contacts (see Witcher; they’re always in dark places, but his pupils never change or dilate…). But others explaining in the comments that light eye color makes people more susceptible/sensitive to light, might explain the pinprick pupils. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Either way, she is gorgeous, and seems pretty chill. 😊🫡",2024-01-23 06:53:52

My eyes are green and people sometimes comment on them, usually the ones that comment are the ones that stand too close to me so they eventually notice my eye colour.

No, we are not mixed, we’ve done our genealogy, we know our indigenous tribes and ancestral trails, it just runs in the family lines.😂💙",2024-01-26 14:28:16

19cynj3,"Honestly I think it might have something to do with humans finding bigger pupils to be more attractive/friendlier looking. There was some sort of study I remember coming across on here forever ago where they had a bunch of photos of women with their normal sized pupils and then another photoshopped version making their pupils bigger or smaller. By and large the men in the study found them more attractive with the bigger pupils even after previously voting them as unattractive/not as friendly looking. With lighter eye colors, the pupil size is much more apparent, and then take into account the light sensitivity causing their pupils to contract and you get that infamous 🧿👄🧿 stare.",2024-01-23 06:41:16

So “turning” is something that can sometimes happen to big dogs (and Great Danes are particularly susceptible) and its when their stomach essentially “flips” so it basically...well, think of crimping a hose while it’s on to stop the flow.  Anyway, I’ve heard that to try and prevent it not to let your Dane over exert themselves as a precautionary measure.  They’re just so big that doing to much could cause the stomach torsion and if it went untreated it kills them.

162o3k1,"that was some bullshit... if you submitted something that satisfied the very vague requirements, you should have at least received a passing grade

something similar happened to me too - an art teacher in middle school had what I thought was a fun idea: we all took out a blank sheet of paper, she drew a random line on each one, and we were supposed to use it as a basis for a drawing - no parameters, just create! 

now I wasn't ever a very good graphic artist, but I thought I had something cool in mind: my squiggle kinda looked like a hand doing the ""hang ten"" sign, so I ran with it and made a forced-perspective drawing of a kid going 🤙, with the ""camera"" right in front of the big hand and the kid looking smallish behind it 

kinda like this one, except drawn by an admiteddly art-challenged 12yo:  https://resizing.flixster.com/MHVnnlJnmKyYrriJSJbRhWyhVhQ=/300x300/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p12794882_k_h9_aa.jpg

man, she hated it! and I got the lowest passing score possible... I was confused and hurt, this style was beginning to get popular at the time (the 90s) so I thought maybe she was out of touch..

but one thing was true: I was not a talented artist either. I usually got excellent grades on my school artwork out of sheer _effort_... some of my friends were able to crank out good quality work in far less time than I could produce something barely in the same neighbourhood as theirs. so this was the day when I gave up on chasing good grades in art class - the effort to benefit ratio was too rich for my blood, especially when others got better grades than me with far less work _and_ unoriginal ideas.

in hindsight I now think that it would have been best for me to tell myself ""who cares if none of these people like what I make, as long as I like it"". well tbf I did tell myself that all the time haha... but, when it came to plastic arts, that was the last straw for me. I threw in the towel and went all in on the stuff I was effortlessly good at (we call it STEM these days)... 

in the end I'm well aware of my (non) talent, so we cannot say that the world missed out on my art... but, a kid did miss out on the benefits of making art for himself starting on that day",2023-08-27 21:15:49

bnc9bv,"Looks cool, but what is the meaning behind this piece?🤔",2019-05-11 17:54:29
bnc9bv,"-Controversial opinion warning-
I don't really find this painting creative as the painter doesn't really have much to do with it at all, physics is doing most of the heavy lifting here displaying a natural phenomenon, it could just as easily have been done in a factory pumping out pieces like this by the minute, at most the artist chose the arc and the colours but that's as far as the expression goes.
As far as calling it fine art i think it's kind of like comparing a wallpaper to a fresco, sure the wallpaper is visually appealing and provides a nice backdrop to your room, but it only takes one glance to fully take it in. There's not really any depth to it worth exploring. It's not a window into the artists mind or showing the world as seen by the artist, you can't see the effort of every brushstroke painstakingly applied after careful consideration, there's no sense of handiwork in it that inspires awe or wonder.
To me it just feels empty and soulless.

Edit: Thought i was commenting in the r/toptalent post 🤦‍♂️",2019-05-11 19:51:20
bnc9bv,How should this paint have been used? 🧐,2019-05-11 17:20:41
bnc9bv,"Sure, but when I go to an art gallery I purposefully do so to see shit that takes skill to create, not to see some random splashes of paint or a couple of nice lines. Art imo always has some form of skill attached to it, be it recognizing the potential in two synchronized clocks (or creating a unique experience using anything trivial, really), or on the more “classical side” having the immense talent to sculpt blocks of marble into lifelike figures or to paint realistic portraits or calming landscapes. 

My personal viewpoint is that works which have no artistic skill attached to them don’t hold up to the standard of being called art. They can be called projects, but the term art shouln’t just be thrown around to mean “anything you want it to be”.

Look, art: 🦴🐶🔫🥩🥢",2019-05-11 22:46:25

unomrh,"Chester was definitely one of the most influential people in my life, growing up. I lived a rough life, but I always found some sort of solace in Linkin Park and with Chester. Maybe like just calls to like, and I recognized some broken part of myself in him. 

Regardless, Chester influenced so many parts of my life. I learned to find comfort in music and art, both creating and consuming it. It sounds silly, but I’m pretty sure LP saved my life. A part of my heart broke on the day he died. Now I am pursuing work in psychology and mental health to maybe one day help others who are in similar dire straights. This video definitely made me ugly cry, I hope wherever Chester is, that he was able to find the peace he so desperately needed. 🖤 LP Forever.",2022-05-12 05:50:41
unomrh,"I’m aging myself here, but for me my fist Artist death where I cried and it hit hard would have been Kurt Cobain.  

I will still say that I was very saddened by Chester’s passing.  And videos like these break me.  Sad fact:  the episode Linkin Park filmed for Carpool Karaoke was filmed 6 days prior to him taking is life. You would never have known he was battling depression with so much pain.  😢",2022-05-12 13:36:46

unomrh,"Watching that and singing along actually made me tear up a bit.  I used to to listen to Linkin Park all the time growing up, and when Chester passed, I felt like part of my childhood suddenly died.

16kt6tp,"It’s weird when this happens. When I in high school I read the bottle of Niacin because I had nothing to read on the toilet . 

The very next day I was having breakfast alone in a little bistro when a couple of old ladies who were eating near by said “ hazel, are you feeling ok ? You face is VERY red” “I feel fine” “but hazel your as red  as a lobster - all over !” Hazel starts to panic wondering if they should call an ambulance.
So I said “excuse me , did you recently start taking niacin ?” 

“Yes , I started yesterday “ 

“Well that’s a safe side effect of the vitamin”

1cz4ft6,"Yeah, there was a real Smokey! From the Wiki:

""The living symbol of Smokey Bear was a five-pound, three-month old American black bear cub who was found in the spring of 1950 after the Capitan Gap fire, a wildfire that burned in the Capitan Mountains of New Mexico. Smokey had climbed a tree to escape the blaze, but his paws and hind legs had been burned.

At first he was called Hotfoot Teddy, but he was later renamed Smokey, after the character created a few years prior.""

1bjakvl,I used to work for a security alarm company as a tech and I had a routine job one day just swapping a glassbreak detector for a motion detector. When I arrived I ended up hearing the story of why this lady was ordering this exchange. She had an african grey parrot. One day she dropped a plate and it shattered. The frequency wasn't the correct one to set her detector off. But the parrot mimicked the noise after that at the correct frequency somehow and it kept triggering her glassbreak detector 😂🤣 Still one of my favorite stories from that job.,2024-03-20 12:16:37

I remember sitting on the couch and turned on the tv and the news came on or something and all of a sudden he started cackling. I lost it laughing. I had no clue what he was doing. Turns out Brian (his owner) would laugh at news anchors and other dumb news so now Harley just starts cackling sometimes when someones talking on tv lol Same thing as the person above commented. I would come home from school before everyone else and i'd hear him whistling (his pen was upstairs at the window so he could see when a car pulls up). I walk in and hear him whistling and happy. Then I'd stay quiet until he stopped. Waited a moment and then I heard ""Kenny?"" 🤣 They are definitely smart. Took him a few days before he knew my name and face. Very cool ❤️",2024-03-20 14:26:41

She is magnificent, yet she jettisoned down from the sky one day, grabbed a sparrow and ate it while standing on a gate stump. I was pissed she did this, and screamed at her. She watched me while chomping. 

The Jays argue with her, but she’s the alpha boss.

My parents drank coffee every day in their simple sun room and watched the birds. They did this for about 35 years. Every single day.

Edit: someone asked if this is perfect form for American football because rugby is different.

Response: Correct, for American football. The tackling form to rugby is definitely different. Because like you said, lower tackling form means knee to face. A rugby pitch has more width = more space = more game speed. Plus no pads.

1cc3kdi,"🤣 found the vegan.  
  
Show me the science to support your statements?  
The reason no one agrees with you vegans is because you all just lie...  
  
Like... Cows milk isn't healthy.  
He'll yes cows milk is healthy to drink. We evolved as omnivorous creatures and so are perfectly adapted to drinking cows milk, which is high in protein, and a cocktail of vitamins and minerals.  
  
Or...  
  
Cows cry when sad. No they don't. Another lie made up. I've had lots of cows. They are awesome, smart, and intelligent creatures. I don't disagree with you there... but they do not cry when sad. That's just a lie that PETA and vegan activists make up when they anthropomorphise animal behavior. Crying due to sadness is a uniquely human emotion.  
  
Now... I agree with you on this statement ""we shouldn't mistreat animals""  but disagree with vegan lying tactics.",2024-04-24 21:33:56

When i said lifetime, i meant another 60ish years. Yes, millions.

Can you imagine a better first birthday present than that wooden Audi? I cannot.

Physical, unique art takes its value from the fame of the artist. Custom orders for tens of thousands are guaranteed, early. And if his fame continues to grow, he'll be overpaid for unique custom orders that will end up in museums and or auctioned for hundreds of thousands or millions (half a century later).

If his health and fitness and fortune grant him a long life, i'd not be surprised at 5-20 million USD lifetime earnings, making utterly unique wooden toddlermobiles for spoiled rappers with more dollars than taste.

(Edit - i'm referring to the gotta-buy-them-all shoppings sprees of the newly stinking rich - these unique wooden cars are *good* taste - in fact, the best taste).

And they'll be worth it and hold their value.

No, that's absolutely not what empathy is. Empathy is an emotion. What you're describing is actions which *can* be motivated by empathy. You can donate to charity for tax breaks. A lot of people do. Doing those things is not empathy. Seriously, check the dictionary, you're simply wrong.

>So next time instead of playing moral police, do as I do

I've only just started dabbling in this because I've fully believed that there are certain genetic markers for it based on diseases and things of that nature that are *more likely* to happen if both parents carry the marker, and those markers are most likely to be found in certain Jewish groups than non-Jewish groups. 

But I'm not entirely sure if there is anything that is so blatant as to say ""YEP. This person is DEFINITELY Jewish."" 🤷‍♀️ hence my interest.

Also, to quote yourself, ""it isnt white people being teaching their kids to be racist"" definitely claims, or at least implies, that white people aren't the ones being racist.

16mdcvf,"American here🙋🏻‍♀️ I went to Amsterdam in April and knew bicycling was huge in Amsterdam, but didn’t understand exactly what that meant. 

I was *so* amused by how many bikes I saw, because so much of the US I have lived in/visited is dominated by urban sprawl. [Here’s an idea of just how many bikes there were on a rainy Thursday at 10am](https://imgur.com/a/hzIAhby) this wasn’t even the largest gathering of them that I saw on my trip! 

To convey this even more, the most “dangerous” part of Amsterdam that I saw (aside from maybe having a bad trip on shrooms or eating too much of a potent brownie) was tourists not being aware of bike lanes. 

It’s similar to tourists put themselves in danger in London when forgetting to look on their opposite side when crossing streets…except in Amsterdam you need to be mindful of looking out for bicyclists. They have their own dedicated lanes on the larger roads and share the road along the canal, but the bikes are all sleek and often times a bicyclist would seemingly come out of nowhere.

I was surprised by how many people biked despite the rainy weather, since it’s a luxury here in the US to simply drive or take a cab if it’s raining. Amsterdam had an amazingly efficient metro/tram system but I can see how certain locals might need to bike to a specific stop on one of the metro routes or to their destination

I will also add that out of the several cities I visited in UK and Europe, Amsterdam was my favorite. The people (something like 90% speak English) were so cool and friendly, the museums/music/cafes/coffee shops/etc made for a fun visit because there’s so much to do, and the city itself is charming and so easy to explore on foot. I *highly* recommend visiting, but if you (or anyone else reading my comment) do, please please be “cool” and respectful of the locals! It’s not like NYC where there’s a disconnect between the city being a commercial area first, and home for ppl second. In Amsterdam you have homes just above/adjacent to businesses you patronize.",2023-09-19 11:06:44
16mdcvf,😂😂😂　That’s amazing.,2023-09-19 07:01:08
16mdcvf,"There is a scam running where the same companies that rent out the bikes hire locals to steal them, and then they lose their original deposits. Be cautious ⚠️",2023-09-19 10:39:29
16mdcvf,I recently started cycling as a main form of transport because I moved to a small town and I don’t drive. I wonder if everyone in the netherlands is super fit due to this? I always come back home super sweaty 😅 I’m happy about it though because it means I exercised,2023-09-19 12:35:12

wi5ibt,"Entropy is a measure of disorder. It is a measure of how many ""states"" a system can be in, which increases as systems spend energy in various processes. Entropy always increases and can never be lowered by any means, that is, in a contained system. A system can be any size, a room, a car, a computer, the universe. Now, while it is true the energy of a *system* cannot change and is conserved, which is the first law of thermodynamics, we must also observe the second law of thermodynamics  which is that entropy must always increase. 

For example it is believed that sub atomic particles exist due to vibrations in their respective energy fields. These subatomic make up our elementary atomic particles like electrons and protons and neutrons. Those make up atoms and those combine to make molecules and molecules/atoms can combine to make other things and those things can be in different states like liquid, gas, solid, etc. 

But here's the trick. Nature, by default, HATES organized systems. Solids break down over time, in many different ways. Liquids evaporate. Gasses disperse. Which causes heat and energy transfer  And it turns out in isolated systems, after these things happen, they typically don't just get ""undone"" in any way. Solids that erode, stay that way, and erode further perhaps to the point where the particles are so fine they float away or even finer to the point where they become gasses, or maybe the solid melts instead of erodes. The method of transition doesn't matter but matter has an inherent desire to achieve a higher state of disorder and a state which requires less energy to maintain which usually means breaking down bonds that keep things solid, keep things liquid or keep gasses pressurized/localized. 

Have you ever seen a gas cloud spontaneously shrink? All by itself? Have you ever seen a gas become a liquid without some sort of change in the environment? Have you ever seen a liquid turn into a solid without an external factor? I can say for sure you have not, because isolated systems, like the ones in question above, do not contain sources of energy to create those spontaneous physical changes, which are inherently chemical/physical in nature. It takes energy to make something MORE ordered and that energy has to come from somewhere. If the energy isn't in the system, then melted solids stay melted, liquids stay evaporated, and gasses stay dispersed. Permanently. 

And thus entropy in that system increases. There are more states that 100 molecules of water can be in as a liquid than a solid. And even MORE states those same 100 molecules of water could be in as a gas compared go a liquid. Entropy will increase until there is no longer any way for the system to become less ordered, say by theorical boundary of some sort. But our current understanding of how the universe is currently expanding means that there will never BE a boundary that keeps entropy from ever reaching a limit. Which means that as the universe expands there will be infinite space for *things* to break down and entropy *never* reaches a limit. 

For example, take a cubic centimeter of gold and chuck it into space. Now, the cube is held together by the 4 fundamental forces, strong and weak nuclear, gravity, and electromagnetic. With out going too deep into those, suffice it to say that those forces cannot stay the exact same as the gold atoms begin to lose energy and the vibrations of the elections around the nuclei of the atoms decay and the nuclei themselves break apart and the sub atomic particles themselves lose energy in their respective fields. Eventually if no other *thing* interacts with the gold cube and gives it energy, it can effectively cease to exist. All of it's energy is radiated away into the vast void of nothing and never coalesces ever again. 

If the universe plans to expand forever then, for example, a single photon that gets shot out of the gold through one mechanism or another will fly through the infinite universe forever never to meet another piece of matter ever again. The photons energy will decay into other forms of vibrations in other fields of energy but those won't ever find something to interact with either. The gold eventually energetically erodes in this way, and many other modes of energy loss, to increase entropy, by law of the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and will even cease to exist. 

The third law also states that entropy approaches a constant value as the temperature of the system reaches absolute zero. But we know absolute zero to be impossible to reach conventionally due to the fact that even the most well thermally insulated systems have leaks, however small. So knowing this, we can never stop the march of entropy. Things always become more disordered. 

So when we apply these knowledge in the grand scale of the entire universe, it seems that with infinite space and time, all energy will decay to the point that subatomic particles, or even perhaps what make subatomic particle cease to have enough energy or ample chance to cause any interaction with sufficient energy to create a ""higher"" level particle like an electron or a complete atom and definitely not a whole molecule. Everything just becomes lost weak vibrations aimlessly wandering the infinite void for all of time. 

That all being said, it is a theory that even in approximations will not happen for something like 10^106 years. Which is an enormously incomprehensible amount of time. Especially to someone from ancient Egypt 😃",2022-08-07 09:50:33

Simple.

xpedgv,"What your describing is called ""Darkwave"" (source: am goff and old)

Imo this isn't quite dark synth in the 80s sense. I'd call it Ethereal Post Punk, modern Darkwave, or maybe New Beat.  Definitely somewhere within the three. Modern Darkwave (post 00s) tends a little slower tho, so it's a decent fit (see: https://youtu.be/XSudap5Pyrc)

 This Mortal Coil is an example band that leans more Ethereal. (Post punk is a low level genre in which Darkwave, Ethereal and New Beat are subgenres).


If you're into the sound, you might also like ""outrun"". Gunship is a good band pick there:

https://youtu.be/0aaKlPNdGz8

Also may I recommend https://www.vamp.org/gothic/clublist.html
if you're interested in the scene, it's a good place to start.

And if you're interested in exploring other genres, Ishkur's guide is a great resource to put a name to a sound  and the best way to end petty arguments 😂

Talk about a fish out of water!  
  
A French angelfish at the Denver Zoo got a CT scan this week — and the zoo gave animal lovers a peek into what that process looked like.  
  
On Tuesday, the Denver Zoo shared two images of the fish getting the X-ray scan on Instagram. The zoo wrote alongside the surprising snapshots that it provides the ""highest level of care"" to all its residents and that specialists decided the angelfish required a CT after the fish was observed swimming abnormally.  
  
""Have you ever seen a fish get a CT scan? 🐠 Here at Denver Zoo, our animal health and care teams are dedicated to ensuring every single one of our animals receives the care they need to thrive,"" the zoo noted in the social media post.  
  
""When animal care specialists in Tropical Discovery noticed a French angelfish was experiencing buoyancy issues and swimming abnormally, they brought the fish to our new Helen and Arthur E. Johnson Animal Hospital for an exam,"" the post continued.  
  
 Massive Florida Zoo Alligator Gets CT Scan to Identify Strange but Common Problem  
Medicine teams ""sedated"" the fish — shown in one Instagram photo resting atop a sponge — and ""ran water intermittently over its gills"" while it was examined and given a CT scan.  
  
""We're happy to share that this little fish was on a treatment plan and is now back to happily swimming in its Tropical Discovery home,"" the Denver Zoo added about how the angelfish's buoyancy issues were resolved.  
  
""Our animal care and health teams will continue to monitor this fabulous fish,"" the Denver Zoo concluded its post. ""From the tiniest tree frog to a full-grown grizzly bear, we're proud to offer the highest level of care to our animal residents!""

While Instagram users joked that they ""want to be on that fish's insurance,"" they also seemed impressed by the zoo's hospital, which provides care for over 3,000 animals.  
  
Curious animal lovers can go on a tour of the Helen and Arthur E. Johnson Animal Hospital, which gives visitors a 45-minute ""behind-the-scenes experience with an expert guide,"" according to the zoo's site.  
  
In July, 11-year-old Charlie Clinton of Oklahoma caught a Pacu in a neighborhood pond. The fish, which closely resembles a piranha and is native to South America, has teeth that look like those of a human.  
  
The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation wrote on Twitter (now known as X) at the time that while Pacu fish ""are generally harmless to humans,"" dumping unwanted animals in waterways is ""so harmful to native wildlife.""  
  
""DO NOT RELEASE YOUR PETS. THEY ARE AN EXOTIC, INVASIVE SPECIES THAT CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO OUR LOCAL ECOSYSTEMS,"" the department tweeted with a photo of the Pacu caught in Oklahoma.",2023-09-03 13:21:09

Also the only good spinning kicks in TKD are the tornado, because you can whip up alot of angular momentum, and the spinning hook for the same reason.

A lot of variables have to be PERFECT for that to that to happen (not to mention for ~400 million years that piece of limestone can’t be subject to any forces that would cause it to break). Usually you would only find a horn, or a piece of the pygidium, etc. Trilobites are ancient sea floor creatures that were present during a specific interval of earth’s history. Their anatomy gives clues towards paleo-environments and evolutionary changes that took place as their existence progressed! For example, not all trilobites have horns like these! The proper extraction and study of the organism’s anatomy is important for constructing a history of life on earth! Hopefully that helps a lil bit 💪🏼",2019-02-07 15:02:04

But when fisherman intentionally hurt the animal they have set out to hurt? Reddit goes ""Fisherman is good! Fisherman care for environment!"" 

/u/Olealicat is even trying to convince himself and others that fish aren't conscious to justify the the hypocricy🤦‍♂️

People will go out of their way to help an animal who is trapped. But if that animal had potential to give these people pleasure, say if it were a chicken for example, it's fate could have been completely different. 

Animal abuse is only acceptable by the masses when there is personal pleasure for them to derive from it.

Why can't your logic be used back on you? Maybe I just think plants and animals are equal in terms of value of life, would that be wrong? I guess to you it would be, because then you'd have to straight ip starve yourself in order to keep pretending to be virtuous!


You keep killing what you're fine with killing, and I'll do the same! Just because you convinced yourself it's okay to kill one thing but not the other doesn't mean we must all agree. 


Maybe if your human ears could pick up the supersonic screams some plants make when stressed, broken, and cut, you'd be a little less proud of it!

cq01rh,"Dentist here. Yep, flexeril (a muscle relaxant) taken 1-2 hours before bed helps a lot with this for many people.

The reason many people clench their teeth at night is poor sleep, as evidenced by worse symptoms during times of stress or travel or other big changes in life. Anything that improves quality of sleep should be the primary goal to treat the issue at the source. Muscle activity is very minimal at the deepest levels of sleep, so we need to help more people get to the deep levels of sleep in order to truly heal the issue.

Mouth guards work really well for some people but for most they don’t really reduce nocturnal bruxism (teeth grinding during sleep).

Congrats on knowing the word pharmacology though, I bet you know more than you give yourself credit for 👏 👏",2019-08-14 02:35:10

That guitar guy probably can't do, as an example, some of the basic indoor renewing works without calling the Ufficio delle Belle Arti (a comunal organization institued to preserve the historic value of the city by the government.) and ask to be allowed.

s5r9in,"FYI - this is the effect when using chemical sunscreens, which (overall) work better against sun protection 

Mineral sunscreen doesn’t show up like this under UV light

Also, on a tangentially related note:  Melanoma is an equal opportunity offender.  The skin cancers usually associated with overexposure to the sun is basal cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma.   Youre not really protecting against melanoma with sunscreen. 

So if you take off your shoe one day and see an irregular black dot ⚫️, don’t write it off just because you don’t get much sun exposure on your feet.  These spots really are that sudden, and need to be looked at.  Moreover, if have a weird rash where you have a lot of sun exposure, don’t just assume it’s something else because it’s not a black dot.",2022-01-17 19:24:28

qlmucg,"I have a true story about the same scenario. One of my first jobs as a teenager was at my local junior college gym, where I monitored the place & worked the concession stand during games. It was an awesome job; a lot of the time I literally was getting paid to play basketball. Anyway, I was a bit mischievous as a teen. They had the same thing during halftime, only---if you hit all those shots, you won however much the donation pot was at the time. Part of my job was to select a random seat from my boss, & go inform whoever was sitting in it (about midway through the 1st half) that they had the opportunity to try for the money come halftime. So, SOMETIMES (we were smart enough to space our attempts out so no one caught on) I'd have my friend wait near the office, & when I came out, I'd let him know where the seat was. He'd go sit near them (u could sit wherever) & if they chose not to do it, I was allowed to ask someone nearby. So one night, I'm selling burgers in the concession area, & he comes up to me, looking like he's on something, & he asks if we can try it out. I say sure, give him the seat location, & sure enough, it's an elderly person who elects not to try it. So I give my buddy the ticket, & head back to the concession stand. During halftime we're getting bombarded by people; it's kind of a madhouse. But above all the voices of people in line I hear the crowd roaring from the gym, & I think ""No way the break's over & they're already playing again...🤔""
I found out later that night that my buddy had did it. We live in a smaller city, so, the donation thing was only up to $1600, but still...the next saturday, while I was at the gym hooping, he stopped in, & made good on our plan, giving me (16yo pothead me) my $800 cut. It felt like soooo much money at the time. And in hindsight, given how much we were both into drugs at the time (him some harder stuff) I kinda can't believe he actually gave me my half. But yeah. It felt like some sort of bank heist, lol. And yet, he still earned every dollar too; hitting all those shots, in front of all those people, with only 30 seconds....most people couldn't.",2021-11-03 12:38:51

1angqws,"It reminds me of a riddle my Grade 7 teacher told our class one time. The basic gist of it went something like:

Your rich uncle died. He has chosen you to be an inheritor of his wealth. You can either have $1 Million or $1 Billion. However, if you choose the $1 Billion, you have to spend the every next second of your waking life counting every dollar of it until you reach the 1 Billion number.

Needless to say, after the point ***”You’d be dead before you got to the end of it”*** was made, every student that originally chose the billion instead chose the million 😂",2024-02-10 15:40:19

175d465,"Yup, I've never had the mindset to change my ways in the past. Gradually, over the last 9 years, I've dropped 200 pounds now with 65 of that since March of this year. Never thought I'd get to this point. I still have about 30 more to go right now, but I'm going to have a wellness check in a couple of weeks to see what a good weight for me is going to be and how my numbers look. Once I got to 240, I started looking at my eating and have changed it for the better. Once I get to my final goal, I'm committed to keeping good eating habits.

The downside to getting that big (415 lbs) is the loose skin I'm going to have. It's not too bad right now, but once I get this last bit of fat out of my stomach and back, I think it's going to really be more noticeable. But I still have issues with not recognizing the loose skin and still seeing it as just fat that I need to lose. One of my friends, also a former fat person who has lost it, has been really good at pointing out what I'm looking for and I can tell a lot easier. Working at a grocery store can be rough at times 😅",2023-10-11 17:39:13

v9og7u,"Terence McKenna wrote about television… 😵‍💫

>	ELECTRONIC DRUGS

>In his science fiction novel The Man in the High Castle, Philip K. Dick imagined an alternative world in which World War II had been won by the Japanese and the Third Reich. In Dick's fictional world, the Japanese occupation authorities introduced and legalized marijuana as one of their first moves at pacifying the population of California. Things are hardly less strange here in what conventional wisdom lightheartedly refers to as ""reality."" In ""this world"" too, the victors introduced an all-pervasive, ultra-powerful society-shaping drug. 

>This drug was the first of a growing group of high-technology drugs that deliver the user into an alternative reality by acting directly on the user's sensorium, without chemicals being introduced into the nervous system. It was television. No epidemic or addictive craze or religious hysteria has ever moved faster or made as many converts in so short a time. 

>The nearest analogy to the addictive power of television and the transformation of values that is wrought in the life of the heavy user is probably heroin. Heroin flattens the image; with heroin, things are neither hot nor cold; the junkie looks out at the world certain that whatever it is, it does not matter. The illusion of knowing and of control that heroin engenders is analogous to the unconscious assumption of the television consumer that what is seen is ""real"" somewhere in the world. In fact, what is seen are the cosmetically enhanced surfaces of products. Television, while chemically non-invasive, nevertheless is every bit as addicting and physiologically damaging as any other drug. 

>Not unlike drugs or alcohol, the television experience allows the participant to blot out the real world and enter into a pleasurable and passive mental state. The worries and anxieties of reality arc as effectively deferred by becoming absorbed in a television program as by going on a ""trip"" induced by drugs or alcohol. And just as alcoholics are only vaguely aware of their addiction, feeling that they control their drinking more than they really do ... people similarly overestimate their control over television watching. ... Finally it is the adverse effect of television viewing on the lives of so many people that defines it as a serious addiction. The television habit distorts the sense of time. It renders other experiences vague and curiously unreal while taking on a greater reality for itself. It weakens relationships by reducing ; and sometimes eliminating normal opportunities for talking, for communicating.",2022-06-11 08:26:08

zokszv,"In 2004, a homeless man in Chicago was discovered *living, for three years* in the girders of a working drawbridge. He and two friends used stolen construction materials to fashion three rooms, that tilted from horizontal to near-vertical whenever the bridge opened. An extension cord, hidden in pipes, supplied power for lights, a space heater, 20"" TV, PlayStation and VHS. 

https://www.thisamericanlife.org/407/transcript

edit: Top comment and 1.4K upvotes? Wow!, thanks everyone, I am honored (1st time on Top 😎). Never expected this to blow up like it did. IIRC, this story, when it broke, was quite popular in Chicago, too. The guy involved become a hometown hero, and it sparked a lot of good debate about homelessness and the state of our infrastructure. More than a few people wanted to try what he had done, and one of the bridge's (disused) control booths *was* turned into a unique BnB rental. Surreal!

edit II: Was trying to find the BnB's website. I think it closed (or closed for the season), but: there is now the McCormick Bridgehouse and Chicago River Museum (with tours), and they have an indoor/outdoor rental space! https://i.imgur.com/ofuVJeH.jpg",2022-12-18 05:00:31

Hunting is meant for survival not a sport imo. Only hunt when absolutely needed. Respect nature or nature checks you in the most harsh ways. 

This is calm deer which is odd because it means it can pick up on human scent and isn't afraid of humans also kinda neat because in the digital world we live it it's peaceful sometimes to walk through forests or nature and appreciate things.

How hunters harvest animals is far more humane than the lifecycle a livestock animal faces. Not to mention the additional resources and money drained through this farm-to-store process. Harvesting your own food, to include meat and fish, is substantially better for nutrition, finances, and conservation.",2024-04-20 15:33:22

gic4kx,"I literally posted a scientific peer-reviewed article to this dude explaining the neurotoxic effects of 100% pure cocaine as a molecule in the brain and he’s still saying this. 

I hate to admit it, but some people are just beyond hope on science shit and it would appear we’ve come across one of those in the wild. 

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

It’s extra ironic because he goes:

>bro, look at the research!!!

Then proceeds to provide no research even though there is research *directly provided* as a reply to his post that contradicts his point.. 🤔

I’ve been locked out, locked in the basement, closets, bathrooms, left places like gas stations and 711’s.. I was bullied… but I got alllll those fuckers back one day😈

They were all going to a concert one night so before our parents came home I lit a bunch of matches in the kitchen and threw them in the sink. 

My mom comes home smells and sees the matches and starts yelling at me and I put on a Oscar worthy performance.. I fell to my ass on the ground and started sobbing and said “the world isn’t fair, everyone picks on me and gets me in trouble and you never ever believe me!” And my mom got so filled with emotion and and felt so bad she grounded all of them since no one wanted to admit it and none of them went to the concert.. 

Got my ass beat for a while after that but it was worth it.

I hate them that way so much!! They should be slightly squeezable and mushy ripe. This means they have gotten sweet. Fry in some oil, I like olive oil. They are sooo sweet, and delicious like desert or perfect with a fish dinner or rice and beans, anything really as a lovely side.

Though, since this clip is in China, perhaps he figured the firefighters might not respond fast enough, or at all. And losing this truck might cost him his livelihood since there’s basically no insurance in China (it exists but isn’t very popular or widespread), so he forced them to put it out and now maybe he can just repair the truck.

I wondered about Waltz's background- why I had never seen or heard about such a talented actor before. Because he lived and worked in Austria and Germany (as an actor), and may not have ever become internationally famous were it not for Quentin.

Quentin was SO impressed with his talent in Inglorious Basterds, that he literally wrote the role in Django just for him, catapulting him to international stardom. And i, for one, am very glad he did! He is truly talented.

Talk about an immature argument to make. Someone says Nazis are bad and you pipe up “yeah but there were worse!”… depends on who you ask. If you ask an Armenian, sure… if you ask a Jew… not really no.

But that’s besides the point. You did get his argument all wrong. He’s saying there’s NO SUCH THING AS EVIL. Evil is a made up theological word that completely misses what human beings actually *are*… selfish, opportunistic, social, apes… and any one of us, given the right circumstances, the right upbringing, the right situation, can go much good, or bring much suffering upon our fellow man.",2021-08-27 19:10:13
pcnmyi,">The guy literally massacres a Jewish family in the first 10 minutes.



No, he does not because it's not real. 



>Doesnt matter if he does it for his career



It does because I can kill a guy named Steve for the KKK for money and not be racist just in need of money. I know people like you hate to admit life is shades of grey but it doesn't change reality.





>Also, stop telling me its a movie.

1cyyavk,"Probably not the advice you’re looking for but I wish I’d known this a long time ago: Xanax will basically cancel a trip within 20 mins in my experience. Klonopin will smooth out your emotions and calm you down greatly for a trip while not necessarily “cancelling” your trip. These things are purely anecdotal and you SHOULD NOT just take my word for it and take a bunch of tabs or eat a bunch of shrooms and then pop some other drug. But since I learned this from a friend, I just keep a tiny tiny bit of either one on me when I trip acid (since it lasts so long) but I have used it a couple times on shrooms too and seems to have the exact same effect even if it is just placebo of some sort. I’ve literally only had to take the Xanax or Kpin like 3 times when tripping and I’ve tripped a LOT. But having it and knowing I can calm down makes me calmer for the whole trip. Sorta like a safety net. Also it’s VERY important to note that I am talking about taking a fraction of a xanny bar or less than a quarter of a Kpin tab. I forget exact dosage but I’m talking like less than .5mg of Xanax and I think roughly same for Kpin. A tiny tiny amount will stop the spiraling thoughts and little bit of anxiousness that comes with slipping out of your comfort zone. Anyways, don’t do dumb shit bc of something on the internet, be with someone you trust and remember that if an emergency happens, nothing is going to happen if you go to the hospital for a little anxiety from shrooms or acid. There’s very limited circumstances in which you would get in trouble with the law. Just BE WITH SOMEONE YOU TRUST that is experienced or sober. Have fun, the world is cool outside of your own head. Hope this helps someone. Also I hate pharmaceuticals especially for all the recent deaths but this is one very specific case where a tiny bit of something that I hate and would not use otherwise (used to be addicted to bars) being able to calm and smooth a specific circumstance out. Don’t fuckin start taking Xanax or Klonopin if you are not prescribed it, that shit will ruin your life. Some of the worst stories start with “and that’s why I don’t do Xanax any more” 😂",2024-05-23 21:20:00

How do I use this to make more profit? 🤔",2024-05-23 23:42:57
1cyyavk,"Yes, great advice. Very much matters WHO you share the experience with, and to feel safe. I enjoyed visuals like Moving Art (used to be on Netflix) stuff that didnt have talking or any plot, just beautiful landscapes/ oceans, etc. That and some Pink Floyd, and laughing my ass off in my kitchen cos everything was changing colours around me 😉👌

I always smoked weed with whatever other stuff I did, think that helped keep it mellow too.",2024-05-23 22:26:35

Don't smoke anymore, but was always so fun when, like you say, being away and your tolerance is gone, first hit is like the first time ever 😂

People need to get over themselves, the parents didn’t notice a safety concern, and suddenly people act as if their the worst parents in existence, I’m sure all of you are 100 percent perfect and noticed every single possible thing that could cause a child to get hurt, because that’s how life works 🙄",2021-12-31 17:02:45

rsu8ra,"while I totally agree these kids are DOLLS and no doubt great parenting and a loving home is the foundation *here*, just want to add: don’t always look to a kid’s behavior for evidence of good or bad parenting. The two things are not always as congruent as they appear. At all. And it works in both directions. 

You can be a great parent and still, something is just off with biology or other factors. And you can deal with a lot of abuse or neglect, and stay loving and kind (though likely with other problematic copes or trauma responses... ask me how i know lol)

But these kids are especially wonderful, and since it’s true of all of them and they are all so young, I def agree on going with “great parenting crafted this” on *this* one, for sure. Lovely lil family🕊

Was so traumatizing learning about such cancers at that age and that it could happen to people our age as well.

Everyone was so happy when he came back all healthy looking again, I remember welcoming him back so clearly.

12rgfn5,"I'm the nanny of a 2 year old, and this is basically how she interacts with dogs, complete with attempting to smooch them (although she prefers to give hugs).

The other day we found the friendly neighborhood kitty out and about (now that the weather is warm again). I know from experience that this kitty will only tolerate me if *she* approaches *me* but she will allow the toddler to toddle after her, softly play with her tail, pat her head, and so on, but only for a few minutes before she gently tells us (well, me) that she's finished.

So the other day the cat approached me and I stroked her back once or twice before she wandered off and the toddler was enraptured in her little red wagon. So I released the child and reminded her to use her walking feet and gentle hands. She played with the kitty by: walking slowly to the cat with a huge grin on her face, patting the cat softly on the head or on the side, sprinting back to me at the end of the driveway yelling ""hug! Hug!"" and then repeating the entire process. Walk to cat, pet gently, run screaming to nanny, received hug, repeat. After a few rounds of this, the cat informed me that she would like to be left alone and I was a little worried how the toddler would take it, but she did well. She blew a kiss up to the kitty and climbed back into her wagon for a ride.

Watching this baby gently fondle the deer's soft ears reminds me of watching so many small children do the same thing to cats and dogs. So sweet 🥰",2023-04-19 18:07:21

14avr4w,"Which you should never actually do. I know you’re reciting lyrics but to anyone who’s interested in getting into Polaroids, never shake them while they develop. The cameras are designed to spread the chemistry evenly across the surface of what image is developing. To shake it up may cause the chemistry to not be as evenly spread, leaving some sections undeveloped and or other sections over developed.

My guess is that when Polaroids were becoming more affordable and accessible, people who knew about the development process of film photography, took what they knew about the actual development phase of developing those reels. In that process the reel along with the chemistry is agitated, much like periodic shaking, to get a even and thorough development. Film photography was around much longer so I assume the process would be more well recognized and utilized when waiting for Polaroids to develop, because Polaroids take time to develop and people would like to somehow speed up that process in any way they could. All it takes is one person to shake their developing Polaroids and for them to assume it sped up the process and then inform others of their theory on the matter. Then more do this and others take witness to people shaking their Polaroids once they eject out their cameras. Next thing you know, everyone’s doing it and it becomes so common that people then make mention of this practice by adding such instructions in their songs lyrics.

Don’t shake your baby, and more importantly, never ever shake your Polaroids. We are watching and we will know when and where you are when you least expect us, you’ve been warned👁👄👁",2023-06-16 22:17:56

14avr4w,"My ex-wife shook my four month old, and I saw it, as I was preparing to leave for work.  I handled it by soothing her, and coaxing her to let me hold my son as I called out for work for the day.  Then asked her to call her midwife, doctor or anyone she trusted in the medical field for advice. 
Postpartum, extended frustration and lack of sleep took a massive toll on her, even with an incredibly large support system.  She wouldn't let me feed the kid at night, due to some attachment issues and other mental health problems she refused to address. Also constantly tried to force me to allow the infant to sleep in our bed. 🤦 
I tried as hard as I could to help her from day one, and she ended up doing about 2 months of medication and counseling before deciding she didn't need help anymore... 
She wouldn't let me hold him, wouldn't lay him down for a moment...  Just clinged to him even when she was on the verge of snapping.  It was a nightmare for both of us.  Needless to say, we're no longer parenting in the same household. 
Marriage counseling, the works.  I still worry about her, especially with my kids.",2023-06-16 19:37:50

1awstao,"In South America, Bolivia, we call it ""golden bear"" (osito de oro) because of its golden shiny fur. A member of the Sloth  family as you can see.  It does not feed in captivity, it won't eat!, and is primarily nocturnal.  It must be released into the wild so it can survive.  Beautiful creature. I only saw one alive when I was young, and held it in my arm. When they feel threatened will rise its arms like that, totally harmless. Almost a mythical creature because are really hard to spot or get a hold on one. The guy on this video was very lucky. Again, a lovely and beautiful creature.

I live in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, region close to the Amazon. Tropical weather.

Dieting is currently on pause for me due to  pregnancy, but I was able to lose 30-40 pounds last year by eating to my basal metabolic rate, tracking protein/fat/carb ratios, and working out a couple times a week. I expect to be able to maintain it a lot better! ... once I have this baby and am done re-losing the baby weight, haha",2022-07-22 23:15:53

17ogdvj,I loved how he took a few seconds to breathe and put the controller aside before releaving the tension. Responsible celebration. 😅,2023-11-06 07:29:13
17ogdvj,"The second paragraph is completely right and I agree fully. However, 

>Guitar Hero is explicitly set up to soft-mimic actually playing the guitar 

The guitar hero video game controller is similar to a guitar only in the shape of its plastic form. I was very good* ( *not like this guy) at guitar hero as a kid around 11 onwards, but I don't think it helped me in any way when I later learned to play guitar around age 20. The two acts are just completely dissimilar. 

Where it's different is Rock Band drums. I got very good* at rock band drums when I was 18, I played it obsessively for about a year and after that I found that I could play the drums. There are still major differences (main ones being no left foot so no hi hat practice, and no dynamics) but *that* I would describe as soft-mimicking. I used to enjoy unplugging my electric drumkit from the game, and playing along to the tracks with the kit. It sounded surprisingly good! 

Summary - You're totally right that if he had devoted hours of practice to the real guitar he'd be really good at it, but he played a video game lots and lots instead. I'm sure we can all relate to that 😅",2023-11-05 22:00:47

If the plug isn’t put in then the water travels through pipes and launders to another part of our site where we have “settling pits” where the clay was historically processed and any byproducts were removed. The water is all recycled from a nearby working clay works & then when it leaves our site it is fed into a flooded pit and that water is used elsewhere. So the water is continuously recycled and moving to different parts of the site. This is purely to show the machinery working because historically these machines were powering pumps that were pumping clay slurry, not water, across the site for the china clay (kaolin) to be refined and dried.",2023-05-13 12:26:02

158bg1k,Sounds good bro 👌🏻 my point still stands. How much you take in is more important and more crucial than how much you exercise out. You can be super inactive and consume few calories a day and lose weight. I also wasn't being hyperbolic. People eat that much and more all the time? Most people will not be able to burn off 5000 calories DAILY. I don't care about Olympians. That's not who I was referring to.,2023-07-25 00:57:57

l2mtfx,"Wow, to be honest, to start off with was kinda strange in a good way. I was looking at this guy who is so like me and obviously my dad but after a year or so our relationship felt laboured. Thats not all on him though. I was dealing with my own shit at the time and, well turns out he was too. Like father, like son an all that. He was great to my kids and really tried to be a good grandpa. Maybe just too much water under the bridge though. I always check up on him at the holidays and have a great relationship with my half sisters who are amazing aunties to my kids but he did the same to them as he did me and abandoned them so I guess habit is hard to break. I have no ill feelings toward him, just feel sorry as I said. I don't know your whole situation but my advice would be, if you did get back in touch with him, would it affect you negatively in any way? Sometimes it just nice to quell your curiosity but the main thing is just go in with an open mind and no expectations,  if you do decide. I'd love an update either way lol.

He looks up and stops talking, and a boy mumbles, ""seven....""

Mel Brooks is incredulous, and repeats ""Seven?"" One of the other ""leg-half"" kids, sensing a mistake, straight up opens the trench coat, looks up at his top half, and says, ""Try eight!"" 🤣",2022-12-10 15:54:02

15p9ut5,"My family was visiting a relative that were hoarders, and we stayed with them because they offered instead of going to a hotel. There was rat poop everywhere and we even saw a few rats while we stayed there. 

Nastiest thing I saw: they had a popcorn machine in the living room which for some weird reason had a sink there… they couldn’t even get to it because there was no way to reach it. My husband and I were helping them organize and clear some stuff and eventually cleared a lot of stuff from the living room. They had like 3-4 full couches and some few love seats and still had half of the living room blocked off because of SO MUCH stuff. Anyway, ae cleared a path to the sink in the living room where the popcorn machine was at. Few days later they used the popcorn machine (without cleaning it) and used the popcorn kernels  and bags by the popcorn machine which I don’t doubt all had rat poop on them. They offered us some but I was not about to eat rat poopy popcorn from a rat poop popcorn machine. 🤢

We went to a hotel before the trip was over.",2023-08-13 09:13:21

When I was beginning to learn other languages (Spanish and Greek, my first two languages) I was like naw fool, this shyyte is hard af. Why does everything have to be so complicated?! English is sooooo much easier than this shit! But, I kept up with it, I wanted to elevate myself with my own personal education, and brag to be honest, lol. Now though, whoke different conversation. ENGLISH IS HARD AF! Seriously. Especially the differences according to region, sure ALL languages have variations according to region, absolutely, but the way American English differs from here in CT vs deep southern is crazy different. Like I will literally argue with my friend over 🤣 crawfish, crayfish or crayfish (yes, 3 different ways for the same word) 🤣 Nevada or Nevada 🤣 and don't get me started on slang.

qcydfm,"My name is Molly and I worked in a preschool with a little lad who really struggled with Ls, Rs, and a few other ~~words.~~ sounds.

His speech teacher had a lesson with him once a week, and one day she asked me to join them and she asked me if I could help him with the letter L for the next week. I said sure, what do I have to do? And she said I had to ask him to tell me what my name is a few times a day so he could practice sticking out his tongue when he said ""MoLLLLLLy."" I was jazzed, cause I really liked the kid and I told him if we worked together he'd get it figured out in no time.

For the next week I'd pretend to sneak up on him and ""surprise him"" with a pop quiz. I asked him every day what meal we were about to eat - LLLLLunch! What color is this pencil? YeLLLLLLLowww. Stuff like that. I told him he was allowed to stick his tongue out at me as much as he liked, which he thought was *hysterical.*

The next time he had speech, we got to show off all his lovely L words. His next project was saying all the L words... without sticking his tongue out. It gets delicately placed right on the very back of your top teeth, sometimes with just the barest hint of the tip of your tongue sticking out between your top and bottom teeth. I pretended to be grumpy and told him he couldn't stick his tongue out at me anymore, but we could still practice.

Within a week or two, he was saying my name with ease, no more ""Mowwy"" (at least not from him.. I'm also a nanny and I'm regularly called ""Mowwy"" by tiny people).

Thanks for unlocking that memory lol

Edit - a word, and also to add - you're welcome for making you play with your tongue to figure out how to make an L sound 🥰 

Second edit - my best friend found this. Hi, Tomm!",2021-10-21 23:52:43
qcydfm,"I felt like I could follow the characters with the sounds but I don't speak or read Chinese. I kept trying to hear the tone when a particular character came up but I couldn't remember how it went the last time I saw it!

Reminded me of when I was eavesdropping on my Chinese friend speaking Chinese to her dad and trying to listen for ""number words"" when she told him what time it was. It all sounded the same to me 😩",2021-10-22 03:37:48

* **UAnimals** https://www.facebook.com/UAnimals.official/

Quote from their facebook page:

""While our defenders and defenders protect our lives from Russian invaders, we continue to fight on the volunteer front and save the lives of animals.

Today we redirected 1.5 ton of feed for ""Wild Animal Shelter"" in Boryspolí. Also we re-routed 500 kg of dog food to the Pitbullhelp shelter.

Currently preparations for the distribution of dog food at Kyiv . Tomorrow at two locations (you can find details in the post below) volunteers will be distributing a bag (10 kg) in one hand.

Traditionally, the UAnimals team provided assistance to refugees, mini-shelters and home-type shelters throughout Ukraine. 15 institutions received financial assistance today and a number of other institutions received feed.

💙The Ukrainian people are extremely strong - despite all the difficulties of the war, they continue to work and help everyone around them. That's why Ukrainians should not be broken. Let's hold on! 💛""",2022-04-19 09:22:09

More than a few days that I had to do the ""pretend to stamp the Clippercard but don't and just walk on"" trick lol.

The headmistress at my primary school went to extraordinary lengths to convince the board there that I was a good fit for a scholarship system that they had in place for families on the lower end of the income spectrum.
It was a nice school with a lot of good people in it.  I didnt fit in very well socially and didn't really get my full potential out of it but everybody tried their best and I have no complaints.",2021-01-04 15:01:08

There’s also the fireworks people set off around New Years as well. The worst part is how unpredictable the fireworks are - someone could set one off at any point in the night, and ruin someone’s sleep (either by a pet getting startled or just the sound waking them). A lot of people have work the next day, and it’s selfish to continue to set off fireworks knowing that. But I’m sure that won’t stop anyone 😔",2022-07-03 14:07:47

""You are as beautiful as a goddess... No mortal or level minded man could resist such impeccable  beauty...

  Spot on little girl.. 👅💦💦""

And it gets worse from there.

Oh the self respect.",2023-07-25 19:50:37
159a3lp,"I am not a mental health professional, but as someone who suffered in a similar situation for years and years, my first step to taking care of myself was personal hygiene. 

Shower daily, get a bottle of lotion (I like Cerave) and use it on your arms, legs, body, and face after your shower. Keep your clothes, towels, and bedsheets clean, and change them if they don't feel or smell fresh (especially underwear!). If you do nothing else all day, do these things. It will help you get out of your head and connect with your body and mind. 

My next step was to buy into meditation and mindfulness. There are tons of free guided sessions out there on youtube. Do a short session 1-2 times a day and you will notice a difference almost instantly. 

And if you have the means, I highly suggest therapy and a psychiatrist. There may be low cost and sliding scale options in your area. ❤️",2023-07-25 20:48:31
159a3lp,"For anyone who may feel overwhelmed, you can hire a cleaning service to come out and do one-off cleans, annually, quarterly, monthly, or weekly cleans. It is actually surprisingly affordable and they do everything from single rented rooms to mansions. 

Also, many have free or discounted services for people with cancer, disabilities, other critical health issues, or extenuating circumstances. 

Call a pro when you need a helping hand. You're not alone, and we've seen it all. ❤️",2023-07-26 00:25:21

Don't worry it was only $8 billion dollars worth of gold today, half of which was looted from Jews during the Holocaust by ripping out their teeth and resmelting it into Nazi gold bricks of death and suffering. But don't worry in Switzerland money is money 🤷‍♂️ they don't care if the money comes from robbing mother's, father's, and children by ripping out their gold teeth before murdering them.  Fuck Switzerland 🖕

14334o6,"I guess that's the thing -- I *do* have that at home. (Well, a 65"" OLED with pretty great sound.) And I watch movies on my TV all the time, and action movies look and sound great on it. But action movies are always so devoid of anything but visuals (and most often shaky ones) that it's not worth it to me to pay money for.

Movies I'll pay money for are the big ones from animation studios, however. Those I find fascinating because I'm curious to see the latest achievements in CGI, and they usually blow me away. Last I went and saw was Avatar: The Way of Water, e.g. That kind of stuff. Space stuff. End of the world stuff, like War of the Worlds, and similar. The immersion is what I'm after. Sell me a world, and I'm there. The other type of movie I'll pay money for is something my partner wants to see for date night, lol. But then I don't really pay for the movie, but for the company and sharing an experience with someone else, rather than for myself.

But most action movies with their hollow characters and cheesy lines are not worth it for me.

Sorry to double down on this so hard, but this is doubling as a bit of self-discovery for me at the same time, so please bear with me. 😬",2023-06-07 22:22:04

for starters, dog fighting breeders can and will move onto the next breed after pits are banned. they'll go for rotties, then german sheps, then mastiffs, then this, then that. so we're just gonna keep banning dogs till there's no dogs left? seems counter intuitive

ppl will then create some new breed after more breeding and such and call it xyz. then they'll ban that, then the cycle will repeat. 

wanna know how to curb dog attacks? BAN unlicensed unregistered dog breeders, AND ban male unneutered dogs.

something like 94% of all dog attacks are from **male, unneutered dogs**. if you wanna make laws that are ACTUALLY effective and ppl can't easily work around, start there. ppl who train aggresive dogs want unneutered males. ban male dogs from being unneutered, ban unlicensed dog breeders, and dog attacks will basically poof

banpithate subs and their pathetic movement is based on, you guessed it, hate! they'd rather take the cheap easy way out instead of fight the root cause. they'll blame it on being OH SO concerned for the kids, but they're the same ppl who are anti vaxx or anti abortion. they don't care about the kids. they care about power.",2023-10-28 03:36:49
17hsnax,They still got a mean bite with lots of force one of the dogs that has lots of lbs per square inch up in the top five I’m pretty sure my friend had a one and was breeding em with another male he knew the owner of his was female she was a sweetheart but man play tug a war with a rope  are play with her with any of her toys no way yet getting em away from there grip they had pretty close to lock jaw we would just swing her around on the rope and to curls with her while she hung on😂 she weighed about 80 too when she wasn’t pregnant.,2023-10-27 22:21:30
17hsnax,Could be either one. 🤷‍♂️,2023-10-28 08:34:10
17hsnax,Oh no he coming….😭😭,2023-10-27 23:33:24
17hsnax,"You’re thinking of English Bulldogs, not Bull Terriers. 

American Bulldogs are not terriers, and Bull Terriers are not descendants of molossers. Molossers became mastiffs, of which there are now several varieties with similar size and bone structure despite vastly different appearances. An American Bulldog is also related to a Great Dane (German Mastiff), an Neapolitan (Italian Mastiff), and a St. Bernard (Swiss Mastiff) – none of which are terriers. Bull terriers are related to Dachshunds, Chihuahuas and Jack Russells as well as Pibbles. 

Terriers are quick moving for hunting vermin and are aggressive toward small animals for the reward of accomplishing the task of killing something. Mastiffs are protective of a human or animal family and guard against intrusion by perceived predators (broadly speaking, of course; their appearance does most of the guarding these days). Most home-life giant breeds are huge wusses, and most working giant breeds couldn’t care less about people other than their own human supervisor and animals other than wild canids. 

American Bulldogs’ temperaments are like an English Bulldog and Great Dane combined. Playful, silly, and affectionate with the ability to stand their ground if they sense danger to their humans. Not terribly bright but trainable enough to be wonderful family pets. They’re never going to keep your property free of pests, though. 

Tangentially related anecdote: I once saw my English Mastiff “stalking” something in my back garden. I was proud of her for a moment until I caught sight of her prey. It was a slug. She was stalking a slug. Her sister, a chihuahua, was known for chomping wasps out of the air and chasing squirrels twice her size up trees. Not everybody can be a winner. 🤣",2023-10-28 10:03:25
17hsnax,I feel u 😞 I'm in the same field and it's so exhausting mentally and physically...i love dogs sooo much and there's no one on earth who can convince me that there's a better animal then dogs..they litteraly evolved for us 😊,2023-10-28 09:38:18
17hsnax,"Yep, I have heard from Argentinians and others who visited Argentina that the similarities on this matter are striking. Not sure why it doesn't get as much attention, maybe Argentinians just don't feel like sharing this stuff as much? 😂",2023-10-28 08:56:00

It has gold in it, it has gems in it, a ridiculous amount of detail, ridiculous amount of skill , sweat and machinery needed and he auctioned it off for 17k. It blew my mind how low it went, and people complained about it being expensive but I just did not see that at all haha. That thing was, art, it was a functional weapon, it was a historically accurate weapon, it was 2 months of honest blood sweat and tears and a display of skill.

Meanwhile you see someone throw a bucket of paint at a piece of canvas and it's sold for 200k because it was ""deep"", 😀. Sure, most art ain't like that but it still weirds me out.",2018-12-03 02:01:23

The moon is also semi-transparent.  The moon is only about 3,000 miles above the earth in the firmament.  The reason we can see blue sky through the moon is because there is water above us, that’s why the sky is blue, we live under a dome.

I laughed out loud watching your “time-lapse” of jupiter’s moons 😂 Worst cgi ever, the wandering stars or “planets” look nothing like that if you actually knew anything about cameras and the lights in the sky known as stars.  Planets are man-made inventions and deceptions, and deception is your specialty.  You can fool the sheeple but you’re only fooling yourself when it comes to us.

om7k0a,"Ah well your degree doesn't help you in knowing other schools have lesser education, I see. 

I is R com from smol hick town. I know bushcraftin and things that go boom. I can tell ya about trees, but not about most animals. Except from local bears n cougars, we had to know about. 

My high school still had overhead projectors, 3 of em.  We didn't have computers, or enough tables for roughly 2/3 of the class, every class. The P.E. has an obstacle course like what you see on ninja warrior tv show, and our history class was looking at local lava fields, eating cougar and talking about black powder rifles. While we made our own snow shoes, I'm sure other schools had their classes inside well built, non leaking, HVAC controlled buildings filled with books. 

Aight ye I'm sure somewhere along the way they said something about turtles n such. It's different in rural areas.  C'mon tho I gotta point, though. Kinda. 🤔😆",2021-07-17 19:29:27

wyjacv,"364%… is it really that hard to write 3.64 times? The chicken you’re eating has increased 3.64 times in size over the last 50 years. Why does every number need to sound like it’s the end of the world?

EDIT: BTW, the math in the picture is inaccurate. 4202 / 905 is 4.64, or 446% (DUN DUN DUUUUUNNNN !!!). But that’s compared to 1957 which was 65 years ago. Compared to 1978 it is 2.32 times (or 232%) which was 44 years ago. Where is the 50 year old figure from 1972?

This leads me to question the authenticity of this claim entirely. Although it’s certainly possible that the 1972 figure can be 3.64 ( a factor between 2.32 and 4.64), because of the poor presentation of data here I call bullshit on this entire claim. And I won’t google this further because I’ve spent enough effort on this already. Peace 🤘🏽",2022-08-27 06:34:08

wyjacv,"This is exactly what they are. Genetically modified meat chickens. The picture is dumb af though because the chickens are all the same breed, just young to adult.

I grew up on a ranch. We had 40 laying hen, 6 turkeys, 8 ducks and 6-12 of these buggers at any given time. It is well known amongst farmers and ranchers that this breed grows exponentially, often times to the point it can't walk or its heart literally gives out; so you pretty much hit the nail on the head there. Any time one would get to that point, we would give it an amazing last day (a bath, worms, take it in the house, etc.) before its head was chopped off.

Hilarious that you think geologists are wrong about a 60 million year old set of basalt columns.

u69ssl,"My cousin is going through some after effects of covid that are making her drop weight at an alarming rate. We are concerned for her health of course, but my mom once made the comment that she'd ""like to have what you have, just for a little while,"" to drop some of her extra weight. Like.... how warped is our society that being skinny and not being able to keep weight on at the expense of your health is a good thing?? Yea I'm sure these people just love their illness and what it js doing to their bodies, because skinny=good. 🙄 I'm sorry you're struggling with that, and I hope you find relief and wellness soon!",2022-04-18 19:33:05
u69ssl,"It definitely is, on average, harder for women to both lose and maintain weight due to cultural mindsets on women lifting, eating, and the general hormonal profile differences between the sexes. Testosterone is higher in men and predisposes partitioning of caloric intake towards muscle tissue especially when paired with resistance training. Women in general have the mindset that lifting weights will make them either bulk up (which to them means fat, not strong and appealing form) or they simply lift to ""tone""🙄 which leads to mild improvement and then a plateau.

This, coupled with periods, birth control, a higher rate of disordered eating and previous weight loss attempts by women over men, all contribute to the statement made above. It doesn't mean it's not adjustable and can be shifted towards an easier time, but it takes a lot of mental, physical, and emotional work towards shifting the paradigm.",2022-04-18 18:07:50

Some variants are flavored with cocoa or similar artificial flavors. This high-demand product was officially recommended by Nestlé, who suggested it as “part of every American’s diet to sustain a balanced lifestyle.” Controversy over the methods used to crystallize and dehydrate the milk have been ongoing, with human and animal rights groups alike deeming them “unnecessary and revolting.” However, no concrete evidence to support these claims has been found by Nestlé’s internal administration.",2023-03-10 17:29:02

We returned milk bottles and soda bottles, where they were washed and refilled. Bottles out, bottles in.  We drank out of a washable cup. It was really simple.

And I know my genetic luck goes the other way... Some people have to watch every bite they take to stay a healthy weight. I know how hard it is to force feed myself to gain extra weight, and I know it's probably just as difficult to practice restraint all the time with food.

molwqw,"I adopted a catahoula leopard dog five years ago, and the breed has a history with the Choctaw tribe.

>	The Catahoula Leopard Dog is a medium-large, short-coated dog, known for its many varied coat and eye colors and patterns. The word catahoula is of Choctaw origin and is translated to mean “sacred lake.” Catahoulas are the only breed of dog to have historically originated in the state of Louisiana. The breed requires firm guidance and early socialization, as they can be independent, territorial, and protective. For the same reasons, they do not allow mistreatment and will assert themselves in self-defense. Once they know their place in the family unit, they are affectionate, loyal, and gentle. Also called the Catahoula Hog Dog, they are used as stock dogs, bay dogs, tree dogs, watchdogs, guard dogs, and of course as loyal companions.

Just another way the Choctaw tribe has contributed to society. 🙂

Edit: [here’s my buddy](https://i.imgur.com/GBXRknE.jpg)

I also had a ride from an Uber driver a few years ago that, when I was telling him about my new puppy, informed me he was half Choctaw. Super nice gentleman, living around Chicago these days.",2021-04-11 09:01:45

1b0p1fb,"What a over dramatic grumpy hissy boy 🥰 possums are very friendly and only hiss as a defense mechanism to ward off predators or if they feel threatened but really will rarely if never bite humans and they don’t carry diseases because their internal body temp is too cold to carry any disease, including rabies. They fir sure will pretend to be dead if hissing doesn’t work as a last resort so predators will leave them alone. 

They’re also very cute and act like little piggies to any food they can get :3",2024-02-27 10:05:57

1b0p1fb,"My bfs mom is scared of opossums, but we live kinda in the backwoods so there’s a few of em

We have a habit of leaving a garbage bag on the porch and then bundling it up to take it to our dumpster, and she did just that one day. I was going out for a smoke, and came right back in with a “um, I think there’s an opossum in the bag” 

Nobody wanted to scare it off, MIL wanted the thing dead. I went out, yanked the bag off his head and tossed it just in case he got stuck in it. He did not. He froze on the porch, and I just stepped off to give him more space to relax again, before he took off 

It was the closest I’ve ever been personally, and I fell in love with it. If my MIL hadn’t been screeching inside the house, I would’ve tossed the idea of building them a little hideout outside, but she genuinely was near tears

A full understanding they don’t carry rabies, and will fully pass out before trying to hurt you, and she’s still absolutely terrified and skeeved out 😅 so I can’t have a weird shaped cat",2024-02-27 13:15:12

I legit think this comment came from the fact that I almost cut a chunk of my own thumb off a few days ago.

I was stupidly using a giant box cutter to cut some stickers, and it jumped over the ruler and cut into my thumb.

I had people tell me they wish they had a bump that big and I always say no you really don’t lol 😂 I couldn’t even roll out of bed my last trimester, I had to have my husband help me up which was really unfortunate when I had to wake up repeatedly to pee in the middle of the night.

132yamc,"Theres alot of white dudes with aryan tats that they got in prison just to survive, but dont necessarily believe in all that. I used to work in a big box retail store and I had a customer with gnarly tats on his fingers. I didn't even stare at em long enough to see they were aryan related before he told me that he got them in prison and was saving up for removal. Based on our interaction, I highly doubt he was/is racist (I'm ✊🏾) just made some shitty decisions that led to a choice of even shittier options...And now he gotta deal with the consequences.",2023-04-29 21:47:32

132yamc,"I had a customer in his 20’s-30’s, who had a **huge**, blacked-out, obviously ex-swastika tat on his arm, and after awhile he was really open with me about how he’s changed. 

I didn’t ask, like “…was that a fuckin swastika, dude? 😡 🔥 ”; he offered the info, after I knew him (…not hard to miss, super-tall, bald, covered in tats, decked out in leather, 15-20ish years ago when tattoos were less common), knew his order, was polite to him in a customer service role, etc. He explained that he’d had a hard life, made lots of stupid decisions as a teen, really seemed embarrassing about the tat and shitty cover-up, and felt the need to explain himself to me. Pleasant enough guy, but that doesn’t mean anything either way.

Funnily, he always ordered the Seitan sandwich (kinda like vegan bacon, tasty stuff when fried up), and pronounced it Satan. 

I’ll never know really whether he *truly* changed into a hardcore, converted, satanist vegan (that wanted to hit on me), or just couldn’t handle the consequences of branding himself a nazi. I think about him from time to time, and hope he was genuine.

lzywcz,"If that was the case, do you honestly think this video would have been posted? That's just the easy go to because Americans are lazy and they continue to pass it on to their children like it's a talent. All American children end up doing is play games and do stupid Tik-Tok dances instead of learning discipline and a legit skill like this kid here. 

Why automatically assume this Asian kid is a victim of child labor? That's like assuming a black man with a paying job is a victim of slavery. That shit is racist. 

For all we know, this kid wanted to cook with his parent/s, so they taught him to do this, and he's proud of what he can do. Who knows, with practice, you might be able to be that elder that has to bust tables at his restaurant because you didn't want to learn a good enough skill to make enough money to retire. And because you were afraid of ""child labor"", your kids learned by your example to be lazy bottom feeders just like you, Leaving every generation of your family after you poor.

And so that will be your legacy. Your epitaph will read − Presumptuous, dull, and lacking. Scoffed at what he/she does not know. But, he/she really cared about child labor, yet did nothing but comment on a reddit post, to try and fix it.

uwb5i5,"I found him on tiktok and I’ve fallen in love with his art. I teach children on the spectrum and I’ve learned that sometimes words are taken very literally or not quite understood. I’ve learned to let them express to me what they are trying to tell me. Although I’m a dance teacher, I’ve picked up on body language and ways to help make them understand what is being said. 
This year I had a little girl who struggled with conversation. She had vocal stims and when she became distracted she would spin around. When I notice this I would try and engage her with questions, which helped. Our dance season started in August and she never acknowledged me verbally until December. I felt honored and proud that she had become comfortable with me. By the end of the year she could hold a simple and short conversation. 
When I see videos like this it’s such a beautiful thing. Not babying them because they have a disability but encouraging them to grow. ❤️",2022-06-04 02:04:04

iy7mvc,"Personally, I found it to be very melodramatic, which worked in some areas like the opening scenes (where they needed to establish characters with more on the nose actions and dialogue) but really became very grating by the third act. There was a repetitiveness to the interactions between the two main characters that became dull and with the added extra drama™ ended up just feeling schlocky. I'm not an anime fan so maybe this is just par for the course but I definitely felt like Your Name managed to pack the emotional punch of ASV without becoming melodramatic.",2020-09-23 16:36:46

f48b69,"I was full on ""I need to go there"" before reading where it is. Nope, never mind, enjoying it from my phone in a country where I am not considered by law as inferior to men is just fine 👍

Edit: of course there is racism and discrimination in every country, including France. That's shitty and it needs to change. But my point is that in Saudi Arabia the discrimination is backed by the LAW. The legal system sees this discrimination and difference in treatment as legal. I cannot talk for every country, but in France the law considers men and women as equal (no matter their religion) and discrimination is punished by law.",2020-02-15 16:45:20

9zec3t,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2018-11-22 19:49:33

I live in Michigan and found maybe one article somewhere that said they migrate through Mackinaw between the upper and lower peninsula because of the Great Lakes. Maybe it wasn’t raptors specifically, but that’s what I thought. I’m sure smaller birds are not prone to do this!  This picture though looked to confirm what I read. No worries.  

Also 11 miles is definitely seeable for keen bird eye site. Hell, I’m over 60 and I can see mountains up to 70 miles away.  😉",2021-03-15 15:20:17

9fcdpp,"I would imagine a few reasons:

1) no air resistance would be on the subjects inside the plane, so they would fall faster than the plane could fly. (I think, correct me if I’m wrong here)

2) you’re going straight down, and very fast, so your intervals would be shorter. You know, because...splat. 

3) (and a sufficient reason without any of the others) you’re using way, way, way, way more fuel.

For parabolic flight, you really only need to accelerate in the negative z direction at [not quite] 9.8m/s for 30-60 seconds. So, be steadily increasing altitude but not accelerating in the z axis and then bam, face the nose down a bit and hold it. Like going over a hill too fast in your car. But, a really big hill...made of nothing. Lol.

Edit: for clarification, if it’s needed. In parabolic flight, they are experiencing 0 grav while still going up, or rather, before the apex of the parabola.

ow2goh,"My boys were never like this, thank heavens! Haha but their dad isn’t like that either. They don’t have any “macho” influence from anyone so they stayed pretty chill. My oldest was never super sensitive but my second son is very tender hearted, more than my daughter is. My boys love creative hobby’s like drawing, acting, music. We have never allowed any weapon play in the house and I do my best not to allow any sort of gun/sword/shank situation, haha. My second son is the middle child then our daughter is the youngest and she’s a pure princess warrior, through and through. She is way more girly and feminine than I ever was as a child, so I don’t really relate to that, I’m learning though! But she’s also the most feisty out of our kids. She wants to do ballet and also learn karate so she can fight. 😆",2021-08-02 07:08:25

syb2ws,"I have these.  (AMA, if you like)  My dentist calls them a ""all on 4"", a full set of fixtures on four implants - 4 top, 4 bottom.  (I had 6 implants on the top, now down to 5 due to bone loss).  Expensive, but life changing for sure.

Looking at his x-rays (at 0:11) they don't look like the magnetic type that pop in and out, like someone mentioned above.  These use tiny screws that thread into each post to hold the teeth (fixtures) in.  Mine work themselves loose every few months and need retightening.

I had to have my teeth yanked due to cancer/radiation treatments that destroyed them.  Regular dentures were torture for me so this was a must-have for my quality of life.

The procedure (for me) was a bit torturous with multiple surgeries with lengthy recovery, but it's nice to actually be able to eat like a regular human again.    😁",2022-02-22 06:24:37
syb2ws,"LOL..he was all like.. ""yeah...great...teeth...food and smiling or whatever..."" 🤣",2022-02-22 04:21:14
syb2ws,What a wonderful transformation!  And I’m sure his overall health will improve now he can eat properly and the infection goes away. ❤️,2022-02-22 05:04:13

syb2ws,Lad literally turned into the gigachad meme at the end 🤣. Love to celebrate people's well earned Ws.,2022-02-22 16:12:59
syb2ws,This probably took a long time & very expensive. I’ve had 5 children and have bad teeth. Terrified of dentists. One day I hope I get my smile 😀. Happy for the guy.,2022-02-22 16:32:32
syb2ws,He about to lose his virginity 🤭,2022-02-23 00:33:57
syb2ws,"Ahh, great dental work👌",2022-02-23 01:14:19
syb2ws,"Just remember, only brush the teeth you want to keep. 👍",2022-02-22 14:08:26
syb2ws,I think the term you’re looking for is [all-on-4](https://www.nobelbiocare.com/en-int/all-on-4-treatment-concept) 😉,2022-02-22 22:14:32
syb2ws,"Implants usually result in mild “cupping” of bone around the implant, because the bone and implant interface need to establish something called biologic width, which regular teeth have as well.  However, our jaw bones exist to hold teeth, so without teeth or implants the bone is gradually lost.  So in the long run implants prevent bone loss. I’m a dentist 👍",2022-02-22 14:05:02
syb2ws,"Had a family member quoted around 20k. Better, but still far out of reach. 😒",2022-02-22 12:44:13
syb2ws,☝  What they said :),2022-02-22 15:55:22
syb2ws,"In my mid twenties, after four molars, several root canals and a crown, I opted to have everything every one of my top teeth pulled. 

Never made a better health or financial decision in my life. Perfect smile for 20 years now. My wife doesn't even remember they're not stock 😁

No more pain, no more intentions, no more room canals and no more $$ spent. 

I know several people who questioned my decision at 40+, they're all about $15-20k into their teeth, and still go to the dentist at just 3 times a year. Pain, cash, time off work, poor nutrition (sensitive teeth). 

Now they're wanting to do what I did 20 years ago.",2022-02-22 05:02:34
syb2ws,"The healthcare costs in the US are so high because insurance companies cover a percentage of treatment, so they upcharge the cost to get the full cost of treatment covered, plus extra because fuck the uninsured… 💁🏻‍♂️",2022-02-22 06:33:29
syb2ws,Dude that's actually helpful thanks ❣️,2022-02-22 09:11:33
syb2ws,"Ugh I have this problem too. Except I haven't gotten the implant yet as I am under 30. It's horrible knowing what I have ahead of me. 

The dentist monitors me every year to check to see if I am experiencing bone loss in my jaw. 

The reason why I point out I am under 30 is because my dentist has informed me that implants are probably good for about 25 years and successive implants are never as good as the first. Therefore if I get one too early I may have to wear dentures from the age of 50 until death. 😫",2022-02-22 12:07:37

1bt7soh,"Now that’s how it’s done!!

My wife be looking identical to hers and she don’t be in the mirror long at all. Initially It do take her time to personally modify each wig to properly fit her head and get the knots color corrected so it flows into her forehead. She’s a chemist with it and I wouldn’t have it any other way, fyi her hair is down her back but she love her quick wigs because she can change her look. One minute she’s platinum blonde & another she’s a deep red & so on. All her wigs are over 400 and she do deep conditioners on them etc & some she’s had for years & look/feel amazing with tons of volume. It’s all about the upkeep as well.

We both are healthcare professionals and I see women come to work looking really bad & halfazz put together, wigs looking ratted up & malnourished. A lot just throw them right on right out the box without doing anything 😂, there’s a right & wrong way on doing everything if you care enough.",2024-04-02 09:01:03

This is def the, melted into the scalp, make it look real and you‘re unclockable method. And this will be on her head for awhile until the next change up to a new wig or maybe braids or crochet or sum.

Not the method the Aunties and the Grandmas use when they wake up and plop on their “Work wig” or their “Church wig” lol.

Source: https://myparfait.com/blogs/blog/5-reasons-why-people-wear-wigs

Anyways what I was trying to say was rather long and wordy so here's a shorter version: 

Wigs serve as a protective style for delicate hair. Chemicals can damage our hair. Heat can damage our hair (straighteners, curling irons, etc). So to take a break from frequent manipulation and/or to promote growth, many people will put their hair into a protective style - like cornrows. These styles can be covered with wigs, weave, or braids to create additional hairstyles while protecting our hair.",2024-04-01 19:17:52
1bt7soh,"These are really good questions so I'll answer one at a time!

> Why doesn't she just grow her hair out and style her hair like that?

Let's talk about length first... Unfortunately, not everyone is blessed to grow their hair quickly. It's taken me 14 years to grow my hair from 1 inch to 8 inches 🥲


The wig she is installing is also purple. Dying your hair is damaging. Especially when you have dark hair; you probably have to bleach it to hell. It's not always worth putting crazy amounts of damaging chemicals in your hair. 


I'd rather sit in a salon chair for 4 hours and get pretty purple braids than get my hair bleached, dyed, and fried. 


> Is it less work to maintain and apply a wig every time she wants to look this level made up?

This woman in the video seems to have an amazing system and she's probably quick. So for her, it probably is way less work! But wigs that are glued in can last for 3-5 weeks. 

A wig that you clip in; the main thing you have to worry about is keeping your hair flat via cornrows or gelling your hair back! And if you're wearing a clip in for multiple days in a row; you just might need to keep reapplying gel! But clip in wigs are a daily thing and easy to take off!

I hope this helps :)",2024-04-01 22:52:41
1bt7soh,If the wig is itchy it’s from Party City 🤣,2024-04-02 04:07:18

1bt7soh,"If money is an issue the synthetic ones are great for special weekends or very short daily wear! 

But yeah my daily glueless wig was 400 😫 but worth it cause it lasts me a year and my hair is shaved so I'm actually saving money in the salon lol",2024-04-01 20:48:38
1bt7soh,"You're fine! I'll be upfront and tell you that I don't do glue-in wigs so I'm not as knowledgeable but I'll try to answer as best as I can :)
 

> what does your daily routine look like for caring for your/the hair? My first thought after reading this was “geez, if it takes that long to install, what does your daily routine look like to take care of it!?!” 

My go-to style is crochet braids. That's when a stylist will braid my natural hair into cornrows and then take a crochet hook and ""loop"" pre-made braids into my hair. You can typically wear that style for 4-6 weeks. 

AM: Use ""edge control"" gel and gel my natural  hair around the braids (basically along my forehead). 

I have a variety of hair oils that I'll pick one and apply. The oils keep my hair and scalp moisturized.

PM: bundle up my braids and put them in an appropriately sized bonnet. A silk bonnet protects my hair from getting frizzy or damaged against a pillow, blankets, etc. There's different ways to make your hair fit into a bonnet, especially so that it stays on through the night. 

> What do you have to do to take care of the installed hair? What about your scalp? I assume you can’t just wash like normal (as in the way you’d wash your natural hair vs the installed hair). 

So this is where it can get tricky. There's ultimately two types of hair to work with. There's synthetic and real human hair. To keep synthetic hair clean, you can use dry shampoo. You can also use specially designed shampoo. And then there's regular shampoo if you get ketchup or other food in your hair but in MY experience, it's not a Get In the Shower wash. I'll typically wash my braids in a large kitchen bowl filled with water and shampoo mixed together. You just absolutely have to make sure they dry completely. 

You can also buy real human hair. This video looks like real human hair. And in that case, you can absolutely use regular shampoo and conditioner. 


> What do you do if you go to the gym or outside and get sweaty? Or what if you spill something in your hair? 

It's super important to know what your calendar looks like before getting your hair done. Braids are good for summer. Working out or general sweat; it might loosen your hair slightly but nothing a little gel can't fix. A good example: I grew up watching the Williams sisters play tennis with braids. They're easy to throw up in a pony tail but won't get ruined by sweat. 

Do not under any circumstance get a weave or wig installed and do a wet activity. Especially if it's glue. You will waste your money. You will be out of hundreds of dollars. And no one will care lol. 

The beautiful woman in this video might do light yoga and walk her college campus. She might not exercise at all. This hairstyle in the video might be a style she chose specifically for an event like a wedding or a party. 

Nobody wants to ""swear their hair out"".

1bt7soh,"You can easily take the wig off and wash the braids underneath. It’s only going to last so long especially depending on where you live. I live in high humidity and it rains a lot and it’s super hot so personally I prefer to wear glueless wigs so i can take them off each night and oil my hair and wash and retwist when I need to. Sometimes putting a wig on takes less time than doing our natural hair and it’s easier to maintain in braids or twists. my natural hair is so thick i can’t just wash it and go, i have to gently detangle and style or else it’ll be wet and tangled all day and i can’t even use a regular hair tie to put my hair in a ponytail I can only wear a high puff with one of those big ass headband or else my head hurts. I wear a bonnet to the gym when I workout mostly when I have my natural hair out in twists because i don’t want my oils to get on the equipment and i don’t want my hair to get dirty or messed up. So many judge thinking we are lazy for wearing our bonnets  when we are just trying to protect our hair in whatever style it’s in 🤣",2024-04-02 12:42:36

txxltx,"Till adulthood the only real effect was existential crisis and depression.  It wasn’t till i tried to get a job and didn’t have the same level of support that stuff started to crack. 

The signs where always there, social awkward, weird, obsessive about limited topics and detail. But it took a year of psychiatry to be discover i was smart enough to learn myself to completely adapt and be semi successful in early life. Never had to skip a grade, rarely showed emotional distress, always had at least 1 good friend.

My wife is almost 30 and she only just got diagnosed. Till 18 she represented picture perfect hardworking schoolsmart girl thats very strong in professional language* every parent wishes. Again only real effect was depression, being home in the evening without a mask ment crying in bed for 5 hours.

Its only when I analyzed certain patterns in her behavior and pitched the idea that her depression may be caused by excessive energy used to adapt to normal that she got tested and got the diagnosis .

In AD(H)D you might have a point cause concentration issues where definitely a problem in early school but ritalin fucked me up worse beyond destroying my sense of self and emotions in the later school years. My emotional life only went uphill after quitting that crap day after my last exam of high-school.

9390ql,"I posted this below:

Tell them the truth. Or better yet, turn it to a moment of flattery. Say you came in your condom already because you find the other person so incredibly attractive.

Then go and shower all the spunk off your junk, and after 10-15 minutes you’ll be able to go again. This is the time where you should be doing a lot of foreplay. Make sure she cums, and  the extra wetness and her coming will not only make it feel better when you actually are inside her, but she will also be out of action for 10-15 minutes, so you can share the moment of inaction together 😊

You are welcome!!

Also, I’m going to take a stab in the dark here and say you aren’t very sexually experienced, so I’ll give you the most important tip (no pun intended) that they don’t teach you in school: ALWAYS wear a condom. Not just because of pregnancy or because  of STD’s, but because once you have sex without a condom, you will never be able to enjoy it whilst wearing a condom again. Never do it without the condom, once you have sex without the condom, there is absolutely no going back!

We've been having a major sort out in the loft so when we go back to work etc, it's been clean.  Been meaning to do it for years and found this with the shoes etc.  I tried it on and it wouldn't stay over my shoulders!  I lost half my body weight which is great but most importantly I'm still in remission from cancer 😀",2020-04-16 17:34:20
g2do7l,"What are you on about bait? I got married in this dress when I weighed 18 stone 2lb.  I've lost a lot of the weight and as we're on lockdown we sorted out our loft and found it.  It fell straight over my shoulders and went straight to the floor.  When you lose it gradually you don't have that 'woah' look but despite my hair not being styled (due to lockdown), findit it was so special.  I'm going to donate it to a local charity for cst rescue I support as I know larger ladies have problems getting dresses and it has a jacket too.  I hope someone else enjoys it as much as I did in Key West when we eloped (my father, refused to walk me down the aisle as I 2as too fat and he'd be embarrassed but I've changed a lot, went no contact and life is how it should be) 😀",2020-04-16 17:05:10

g2do7l,"No worries, I didn't make it clear so my fault.  It was a shock finding the dress and then putting it on and it falling straight to the floor.  I'm donating it to our local cat rescue charity as they have no funds coming in and hopefully they'll get something decent for it as they're revenue stream has dried up completely due to lockdown.

As for the douche-canoe that punched the police horse for a dare, I hope he “accidentally sits on a hot iron poker. Or better yet, got his face reconstructed for free.
I miss my little farm life that I had going on for a while. It gave me a purpose when shit was getting bad growing up. Unfortunately, it didn’t last long due to the family breaking apart and I had to rehome my horse, and sell my goats and pigs. Things happen for a reason though. So I try not to look back on all of it too much. Only to reflect. 

Also, I would’ve read it either way. Some can be asses constantly, and others have asshole tendencies. 😂 Horses, animals in general, are very honest creatures. You’ve just gotta listen.",2022-11-20 00:52:26

When you're a POW you typical try to low key form a staff within your leadership, and when escape opportunities arise, generally you send the guys in captivity the longest first. Other things are taken into consideration like those who may be facing excessive targeting by the captors or people with a severe decline in health. In this guys case, his extreme memory. But part of it was that he pretended to be stupid so the guards cared less about what he saw and who he interacted with.

Whenever possible I try to ensure the kids get to enjoy their activities as much as possible, but sometimes I have to be firmer than I’d like. It’s certainly not the norm, but different groups of kids require different types of instruction.

Palau's mushroom-shaped rock islands aboard the ROCK ISLANDS AGGRESSOR™ offer a variety of exciting dives: WWII wrecks, shark-infested channels, blue holes, and even a few caves. There are also sheer walls covered in lush soft corals and huge anemones. Beginner divers may find Palau's strong currents challenging....

I'm been giving all of the silly assumptions links to the source and telling them to chill with the assumptions, and I considered that to be annoying. You're on a whole different level. You really aren't concerned with spreading the truth, but you instead are pre-occupied with making people feel shitty rather than helping them be less shitty. It's not what you say but how you say it. Your technique doesnt even enable readers with the truth, which should be the goal, it just shows that you have severely inhibited communication skills. Yay, you feel better about yourself because someone assumed something that you didnt, huzzah. You poor thing 😕 how about you utilize your knowledge to feed meaningful, productive, and constructive discourse, rather than attempting to use it against others to feed your emaciated acrid petulent starved ego.

So all the Greek and Vietnamese and Chinese and Croatian kids turn up in fabulous national costumes, and all the aussie kids born in Australia turn up in shorts and thongs  (that’s flip flops in Freedom shoes) 😂

Everyone brings in their local foods to share, and then there’s a sausage sizzle at lunch.

Australians primarily express their multiculturalism through food, so its great to be able to see all of the different things that folks wear.",2023-10-09 22:02:51

173ys3c,"1. The people have lost my benefit of the doubt 5 seconds after Facebook was invented: everyone desperately craving all the attention on themselves posting the most tragic/fabulous/incredible story; the same goes for every social media. So yes, he's causing all that just to get everyone's attention
2. He has to conform to European attire because he's in a ""European"" school, where there is a precise dress code.
3. What the heck does ""be proud of his heritage"" mean?! This statement is literally insane. Proud of what? Does he live where his ancestors lived, in the forests? Does he hunt like his ancestors? Does he do have the very same routine his ancestors had? No, no and, again, no! Heritage pride doesn't mean a lot when your life has fully changed and conformed to another culture 🤷‍♂️",2023-10-10 12:40:38

173ys3c,">1. You're assuming he's craving attention. I'm sorry you're so jaded.

As well as you're *assuming* he's not craving attention, which can't be more correct than my assumption, according to your reasoning.


>2. There's literally a video showing that he isn't violating a dress code so I'm not sure where you're getting that. You also have no idea what his ancestry is nor do you know their rules so not sure how you can assume he's violating those rules either. You're just inventing a narrative to justify your cranky attitude towards something that's really benign. 

This is getting funny and proves more and more your blind faith in non sense: he's violating the dress code, because this kind of celebration has a precise one and his choice doesn't mean he hasn't violated it. It's just more attention for the school, and more fundings. He is violating his ancestors rules, simply because they didn't have one attire for a degree. Degrees didn't even exist at his ancestors' times 🤷‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️

>3. You don't know he's a diva, you're just making broad assumptions here. You're also saying everyone else got ignored and yet you only saw video of him getting his degree. Sure, there was more attention towards him given his elaborate attire but perhaps his classmates aren't jealous like you seem to be. This almost seems like you're jealous of the attention he got that you never did.

3. You don't know he's not a diva, you're just making broad assumptions here. You're also saying that everyone didn't get ignored and yet you only saw a video of him getting his degree. Sure, there was more attention towards him given his elaborate attire AND STOP! You have just admitted I am right: he's drawing attention *which should be spent towards his mates*. That's not an individual celebration, therefore everyone should have the same attention.
Oh! And regarding that poor effort to insult me, I don't need to wear my Etruscan ancestors' attire to have myself noticed 😉🙂",2023-10-10 19:03:16

a1hy2a,"I’m not being funny, but singling out people with disabilities and heaping patronising “praise” on them isn’t doing anyone any favours.

You often hear people saying that they just want to be treated like everyone else, no “bravery” or hero worship for just being themselves, they just want to treated equally. 👍

A non-disabled person wouldn’t be called “brave” or “awesome” or whatever for finishing last IMO.",2018-11-29 18:12:42

My first two paragraphs were more general, with the third relating directly to this video. It wasn’t so much about only cheering the winners and forget the losers, I get that it takes a lot to go into a situation were you know you’re not going to “win” and still go through with it.

I’m just going on what I’ve heard people with disabilities say themselves. A rousing reception for just being there probably wouldn’t be afforded to an able bodied person who also had no chance of winning (someone who is obese for example), so they are still being singled out which is what they don’t want, I believe.

mbiamb,Working dogs end up in shelters because they’re “destructive.” And 99% is the time it’s the owners fault. It really grinds my gears. My first question when someone asks for advice on dog care/training is “how much exercise are they getting?” It’s usually not even close to enough. Second question is “are you consistent with them?” These 2 things make or break dog’s behavior and it makes me sad to see awesome dogs in terrible situations because they have uneducated owners 😤.,2021-03-24 15:02:35

ac0ubq,"Have had a robotics vacuum cleaner for 3 years. I've never had to vacuum once. It's fun when people in my office/friend circle make a fuss about having to vacuum their house. I moved to the US 3 years ago so I've never had to vacuum a house before. Can say I just don't know how it feels like to vacuum a house/apt. 

P.s. my roommate won the Roomba at a college raffle by iRobot. Best win ever. After he left he took the Roomba. I didn't wait for a day before I already had another one. It's not a ""good to have"". It's a necessity. A ""need to have"". People complain about it not covering the whole area or missing a job but the convenience of not having to take time is just too good.

w261bt,"My uncle rescued a couple of these weirdoes-not an albino, just furry ears-a few years back. They were found in a rough part of the Alaskan coastline and for some reason my uncle’s rescue (off the Tundra) was the only place that could take them. He set up a whole indoor pool with temperature control and little decks and slides. He even had some fishermen come out weekly with a batch of their smaller catches. 
The seals were pretty cool, but they were as doofy as they looked. My aunt would have to blend their food for them and rub their backs while feeding them. After over a year, a large reserve in Washington (?) finally got in touch with them and had the furry buttheads transferred to their facility.
