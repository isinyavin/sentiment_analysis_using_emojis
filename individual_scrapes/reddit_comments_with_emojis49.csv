ck08in,Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how well this cop handled this situation. He stayed calm at most sounded annoyed. Gave lots of warning before doing anything. It looked like he drew his gun for a few seconds after pulling her over the second time as a way to show the seriousness of the situation and the almost immediately put it away. He did everything right and we don’t point that out enough when we see it. So good job officer here’s a donut🍩,2019-07-31 03:53:54

ck08in,"I got a speeding ticket once plus no proof of insurance.

I was eligible for driving school and they said they would automatically reschedule my court date for me to be after the traffic school.  Great!

Which they did!

...For the speeding ticket only. 

So I missed a court date I didn’t know I had on the no insurance piece and they suspended my license.  

I was about 20, very naive, total preppy nerd who never got in trouble for anything ever.  Severely lacking in this type of life experience, I could only go by what I had seen on TV.  

Law and Order, baby.

So I go to the mall and purchase a skirt suit, blouse and heels, none of which I could afford, and also picked up a cheap briefcase.  (A fucking briefcase! 😂)  

I took out my contacts and put on glasses so I would look smart, and I PRACTICED what I was going to say to the judge (I may or may not have in my mind practiced saying “Objection, your honor!”) in the car.

I was so nervous I almost cried.

I arrive, 10 people in front of me in a line, and no joke: one dude was wearing overalls with one strap undone (‘90’s style) except with no shirt.  

Overalls, one strap, no shirt.  In court.  Clearly, I didn’t need a fucking suit.

When it was my turn Judge asked “do you have your proof of insurance with you?”  I handed it to him.  He said “dismissed.”  End of transaction.

I still left there with all the satisfaction of a real lawyer winning their first big case. ;)",2019-07-31 05:26:52

Sure, I would be for heavily regulated legal prostitution. I think you might be assuming what I think here. I replied to a comment saying that prostition was not nearly as dangerous as many male professions. This is not true at all. 

And yeah, ofc region and mode of prostitution (escort vs street) matter. Just like fishing would matter based on region and social class. This is really a critique of all ""most deadly jobs"" lists.",2019-12-24 03:37:15

We’ve got such a wild mix of biomes that in some spots you’re less than an hour’s trip from the Bush, the Outback, mountains, rainforests, cityscapes, suburbia and the beach all at the same time. There’s also incredible history here - 50,000 years worth - and a really good culture around how people treat each other (most of the time) and communities are tight-knit pretty much wherever you go. We’ve had our fair share of shitty governance but for the most part as a nation we’ve done well and as a country we’re even better.

ajf7g2,"We are all looking at this from an education point of view... But from what I can see, a lot of this is down to the mental health of the person
Personally, not vaccinating your kids, is self-destructive. You'd rather ruin your own life and that of everyone around you, than listen to what the facts are. It's loose, I accept that. But I'm a root cause kind of guy and if facts don't work, there's a deeper issue at play. 

The Baby boomers persistently shower their bitterness and entitlement all over the younger generations and then blame us for everything that's happening. It's everywhere, from greedy corporations to POTUS (If those aren't one and the same right now)

Autism (The high functioning end of the spectrum), supposedly caused by vaccines, is not a disorder. It allows you to focus, allows you to challenge the problems of the world head on and provide ingenious solutions. Creating technology that will take the human race further. Allowing the constraints of social aspects of our lives to disappear, forming real connections with people. Being capable of emotions isn't something autistic people are often associated with but Emotional intelligence is a completely different story. It provides great insight into how people work and how not to take things personally. The human brain is evolving, allowing us to control our chimp mind (Emotions) and focus on our logical mind to save ourselves from self-Destruction (Killing our planet) 
To someone who has never been able to control their emotions, through traumatic childhoods caused by inadequate parenting, this is a threat. They've been wrong this entire time

After years of being told to man up or that it isn't good to show your feelings. Being told you're a bad person for doing something wrong, instead of being taught what's right. Watching the ones who brought you into this world treat loved ones despicably, that's going to traumatise anyone at a young age.  

Society as we know it, or as these antivax gurus know it, is changing dramatically. Get enough people together with the same problem and you'll start getting followers. Misery loves company, and we all know that destruction doesn't often lead to happiness. 

Get counselling into schools, everywhere that has the 9-5 culture. Teach our kids from a young age how their emotions work and why they react the way they do sometimes. 
Give the human race Emotional Intelligence... The rest is history

2. People had to be married in order to have kids and all married couples have children. Again, I was something like age 3-5- I thought that women automatically became pregnant some time after marriage and that every woman would have at least one child if they were married (or if they had been married-my mind ""expanded"" in kindergarten when I learned via classmates with divorced parents that not every marriage is forever).",2019-01-16 03:45:31

ewqzjc,"*Your* story reminds me of *my* story: 

My SO and I always sit in aisle seats across the aisle from one another so that his right arm is toward the aisle and my left arm is toward the aisle. This couple (~ 50-60 years old) came as everyone was getting settled in, the middle seat people that were on the other side of us respectively leaned forward and said something like, “We’ll be glad to *let you* take this middle seat so you two (my SO and I) can sit next to each other.” I said, “ No, thanks! 🙂” After a brief pause they reply, “Are you sure?” And I said, “Yup! 🙂” And you’d think that was the end of it but ooooh no. Of course not. After a longer period of silence:


Them: Aren’t you two (my SO and I) together?


Me: Yup! 🙂


Them: And you don’t want to sit together?!?!


Me: Nope! 🙂


Them: Oh. *We* always like to sit together.


Me: You know, you can reserve seats that are next to one another. We both like the aisle seat so *we paid extra* for these particular seats. Plus we live together so there’s no need to have to sit together. Thanks for offering though. 😁


I don’t have to tell you that they weren’t very chatty  that entire flight.",2020-01-31 21:47:01

I have to fly with a 6 month old this fall, (buying him a seat of course because that’s easier for everyone), but I’m terrified our seats will get switched and no one will want to trade with me. There’s no way I’d end up sitting separately from my baby, right? 

I mean I suppose any passenger who chooses to sit by an unaccompanied infant is out of their mind, so I can’t imagine it would be too hard to get them to switch 😬",2020-02-01 03:34:45

aj29yz,"MDs sworn to the Hippocratic Oath are bound to provide you the best service they can. If you have mismanaged your body to the point that equipment designed to accommodate 99.9% of human bodies won't work on you and a doctor suggests the only other reasonable way for you to get a necessary medical procedure done, you should leap at the chance. To interpret that as disrespectful is absurdly childish and short-sighted.

Edit: I get that in this specific instance there was a larger scanner nearby, but that's usually not the case and doctors evidently didn't of the scanner beforehand. As far as the morality of suggesting that Curvy™ people go to the zoo, it's irrelevant. I'd be livid if I found a creative solution when my patient ate their way out of standardized medical equipment, and upon presenting it got lambasted for being ""disrespectful"".",2019-01-23 19:34:14

ib3msr,"Also (sorry 😁) ... Uber Eats gives you your receipt. They do NOT raise the price of your food like Postmates & a couple of other delivery companies & are told NOT to give the receipt to the customer.....says they already have a digital receipt (with the wrong prices & hoping that the customer's don't know any better), because they charge you more & a lot more than the ""real restaurant"" price. Glad U.Eats bought them out. Maybe as soon as they change all their crooked rules & prices, they'll be ok. Sure hope so since it's nice to go out to eat sometimes, as long as we still have a job & don't get the virus. I try to rationalize that occasionally it's ok to order delivery because we're losing so many resturants & it's helping some to be able to hang in there. Heard on the news that Outback Steakhouse has declared bankruptcy, but they still have take out in my town. It's really hard for many right now, especially to all that have lost their jobs. I could lose mine too & hoard up all the toilet paper & food from grocery stores like some are obviously doing before I lose it. Geez!!! Didn't mean to get into all that!!!",2020-08-17 15:53:55

I used to have this problem back in the day when my body was quite new to alcohol. 

The skin would break out in hives and look like real bad sunburn whenever I consumed alcohol. I would have cracks in the foldings of my skin due to the instant dryness after just one drink. 

I went to the doctors to see what was going on and thought it might be a food allergy. But they ran some tests and found out I wasn’t allergic to anything so there was no reason for this to be happening. 

This went on for months and every time I consumed alcohol, I would break out. It was tragic! And so fucking painful. It sucked. But the more I drank, the less it happened and eventually completely stopped. 

I guess you could say I drank my problem away 🥴",2020-05-03 12:24:26

b4p1la,"Ahhh this reminds me of when I found a bookmark @ school that came from the book fair, I turned it in to the teacher and she took me to the principals office and was convinced I stole it. Told me this long story about how life choices you make will affect you when you’re older, and she stole a candy bar as a child and made the choice to tell the truth so that she wouldn’t live a bad life of crime, and that I needed to make that choice too and be honest. She said she wouldn’t let me leave until I told her the truth. I was crying because I really did find it on the chair in the classroom, why else would I turn it in?!?! I ended up agreeing with her because I was afraid I would have to stay all night and I’d miss my family. (Kindergarten) 

Side note, her name was Ms.Cowballs. We even had a meeting in the auditorium once to help vote for what her new last name should be, since she had no intentions of getting married at the time I guess? She went with Ms.Diamond. 🤦‍♀️",2019-03-24 05:29:46

b4p1la,"You can always map the new characters to a sequence of the old ones. A set of infinite combinations that you add elements to is still the same size.

Say every character from the English alphabet is redefined so that ""a"" is the start of a character and then follows the actual character. ""b"" becomes ""ab"", ""babel"" becomes ""abaaabaeal"". You can derive the original word from that, and all the character twin pairs that don't start with ""a"" can be redefined as other characters, so maybe ""bs"" is ""š"" in proper notation, and ""xe"" is 🈺.",2019-03-24 02:30:26

axob7s,"My mother and father went to Australia last year for one whole month. 

They werw in some part of the country when they realised needed to hire a car to enjoy their activities, so off they trotted to a local hire car company to exchange money for the businesses services.

After they were given the keys to the car of their choosing my mother open the drivers side door when she exclaimed ""Hey boiledgoose69's father they have put a big fake spider in the door"" my father came over to observe the prank as did one of the employees of the car rental company. My father thought it must be a fake given it's size, but soon humour turned to fear when the employee let out a shriek and told them to stay back.

Turns out it was a huntmans, just nestled in the gap of the door it was. Also they were not native to that part of the Australia hence the natives shock at seeing one.

I'm just glad mother spotted it before she started the auto mobile, she has a big fear of our eight legged friends and would of crashed the car if she spotted it after she stared moving.

Tl:rd my mum and dad saw a spider down under.

Also - I'm drunk so don't care about any grammar or spelling mistakes. Thanks in advance 😋🤗😁🤣😅

The pencil irony is not lost on me. Pretty funny (to an adult whose kid didn’t experience short shrift). But I might be more concerned if the extrinsic reward system was overblown as it frequently is.

My dad worked nights at the time and would take my brother and I to the public library several times each week (he loved the library as much as we did!) after picking us up from school in the afternoon. I would then spend my ENTIRE evening reading book after book after book after which my mom would write down each one I completed on a sheet of notebook paper for me to take to school the next day. I ended the year with 495 books—1st place! I received a trophy with my name and the number of books I read engraved on the front plate. It was the first trophy I’d ever received and I still have it.

Some have to take up therapy after. After my grandfathers death i dissociated so heavily for a month i dont remember it at all. Mom even though told me i almost left the house without pants (which even I believe to be common sense LMAO) and yet i don’t remember. I barely even believe her.

🎵 

Today was a memory
-I’ll perhaps never forget
-The day I dropped a hard drive
-And crashed my caddy for it
-The luck couldn’t be losing
-Quite like today had shown
-As it became much worse
-When I had no weed to stone
-Found my bird had died miserly
-And left my poor soul behind
-No friend could ever forgive me
-On such a crappy day I’d find


C -It was my liiiiiifffffeeee
-It was the worst week in town
-It was not niiiiiiiccceeee
-Had to swing a few beers down
-Sit on my tail gaaaaattteee
-Poking my eye
-It was my liiiiiiffffeeee
-Now I must say goodbye.

fd2pu0,"You have no idea. One last thing I’m typing this after I finished my message. On I think data is beautiful it showed a chart that even including stage 0 patients, things like skin cancer you could get treated right away: 50 percent of cancer patients go bankrupt WITHIN 2 YEARS. So yeah having that on top of everything imagine what jusr stage 3 and stage 4 people would be. You just have so much and working is so insanely tough. 

You can see my profile long story short have stage 4 terminal colon cancer from 18 to soon to be 25 next month. The stress and as my therapist says having a foot in each world of living and dying. Constantly needing to do things like record videos and write letters to friends and family for when you are dead. Even stuff like that drains you. 

I’ve had to have both hips replacement and a couple dozen other surgeries to miraculously still be alive, I have a high pain tolerance but one of the two things that kill me are the panic attacks about dying. I pray every day and try to be a good person following the things Jesus said not religious but want to be a good person. I’ve had no luck yet so every time thinking about being dead and never doing or knowing anything EVER. Even right now makes me cry thinking about it.

The expenses are so insane. Had emergency life saving surgery at md Anderson for blood clots from my left leg ip. If I didn’t have an Ivc filter surgery earlier I would 100 percent be dead. Even still it was one of the worst things they had seen. 3 surgeons for 6.5 hours, it was supposed to be 3. The massive clot stuck on the filter alone took 1.5 hours. 

Anyways I stayed in the hospital for 2 nights. The cost of everything for that? Over a million dollars. And I’m in such agony and sick I can barely work for my dad part time a couple days every 2 weeks. If my parents weren’t mega hard workers and successful I would already be dead. The things like immodium, Pepto, tums, Advil to compliment the thousands of dollars daily I take of opioids, paying for different thc products since it’s legal here and I’m desperate enough to try anything.

Bottom line I wouldn’t wish this upon anyone. When people talk about Hell I always refuse to believe it. No one ever ever ever deserves eternal horrible punishment.

Even things like not sleeping. I went on a trip and did rides I shouldn’t have but I wanted to make good family memories. Anyways not sure if it’s the spinal and bone tumors growing or the travel and then the car accident of a lady directly hitting me in a right lane turned into us and me in the passenger door on the way to the hospital at least lol. 

So yeah I’m in some of the worst pain in my life in my back hip and thigh and that’s saying a lot you have No idea. It is so unbelievably mentally draining and exhausting. There’s only so much screaming at the world while sleeping 2 hours a day and being in pain the rest.

And the problem is if it is the tumors I need to do chemo. So I’m doing that tomorrow morning and giga stressed. One thing especially in young patients I get really bad anticipatory nausea where I’m not even getting chemo but I get sick to the point of throwing up jusr being in the lab to get it. 

So yeah everything will be rough dealing with this and chemo but if it is the tumors I’m not gonna get better without chemo and we already had 2 weeks off more then usual from the timing of the trip (my parents 30th anniversary). Plus it sucks I can only go to the hospital in emergencies because the corona virus is really really bad here.

I’ve ranted so much but I just wanted to say thank you. I know you weren’t talking to me but every bit of suppoet is so helpful. To know yoh arent alone and you are doing this for other people to hang out for them. And lord for animal crossing and even being greedy ff7 remake and last of us 2.

 But I have such good memories from elementary school playing animal crossing with my mom and now we will have 2 switches so she has her island playing on the tv and I have my own island playing hand held ❤️ One of my favorite memories is me brushing my teeth for school and I hear my mom scream. She was playing and got a legendary fish. She was too nervous so I did it for her and closed my eyes for the sound queue since the looking is so tricky. 

Thankfully I caught it and she was so happy displaying it in her house before donating to the museum and important enough we were late for school that day lol.

Anyways I’ve talked too long no one will read this but thank you for saying this.",2020-03-04 06:40:54

fd2pu0,Someone actually replied to my comment saying that their healthcare in the u.s is cheaper than the parking we pay in canada. They were talking about just visiting the doctor. I can't fathom the denial🤣,2020-03-04 16:49:31
fd2pu0,"That's not how healthcare works.

If you get into any form of accident that require you to stay in the hospital for ant length of time. You're fucked. You take a big risk. 

The point is in Canada, i will live my entire life not seeing myself pay for healthcare. However, if anything happens to me that requires me to pay in the thousands of tens of thousands. It's free for me. Not for you. 

Dude... Stop trying. That's the same argument the other dude tried and it fails every time. You're obsessing over saving Pennys... Over life saving care. Lol again, Americans will stay in denial and it's fucking amazing how bad you are at accepting truth.

Edit: as a Canadian, I find it adorable that you would tell me about how you ""saved"" money by telling me how much you paid for your inhaler 🤣 that's cute",2020-03-04 16:37:20
fd2pu0,"Lol I think the parking is offset the fact that we don't have to put away our life savings and get in a lifetime of debt to go to college like you. Good luck paying your tuition with your PT job 👍. Hopefully you don't get any medical bills piled on while you're paying off your tuition...

By the way, your wrong if you're actually going to compare the price the average person pays for healthcare in Canada(free) vs the healthcare in the u.s by cost alone. You're a complete joke if you think an American pays less for healthcare than a Canadian pays parking. Lol you're actually funny my dudee!

I knew Americans were in denial. Didn't think it was this bad


Lastly, I think you're just talking about doctor visits. Lol I'd like you to think about your hospital bills if you were to have to stay in the u.s hospital due to a car accident. You'd be there for a minimum of 6 weeks. That would probably cost you in the THOUSANDS UPON TENS OF THOUSANDS IN the u.s. I know for a fact your student insurance doesn't cover this completely. (On top of that. You're privileged enough to get your medical bills insured. Most Americans don't. In Canada, thats universal and free for everyone. Even a homeless man. Not just privileged students like yourself. 

However, in Canada, it's free. 😊 All one has to worry about is recovery ... 

So again, stay in denial my dude",2020-03-04 15:49:21

I was walking home from work late one evening last year about this time, a few weeks before Christmas. I took a shortcut through an alley and noticed that there was a young lady who was curled up with some cardboard as a blanket, her clothes clearly not winter proof. I decided it would be best to take her home and freshen her up. I bathed the grime off her and, well one thing led to the next. At one point I was fucking her so hard you'd think she was still alive.

Which I feel is a little silly. I mean, obviously, that’s a terrible thing to let happen. But, you know, could it be JUST possible that the root cause here is a vehicle fleet that’s older than a lot of the carriers themselves and a vehicle maintenance division that’s stretched so thin that an oil light or a “low brake fluid” warning won’t necessarily be enough to get them to come out for preventative maintenance?

qsw3n3,"Guess you're still there. That's a long time to be bored. 

One time I had to go do my ACT testing in order to get into college, but I made the dumb decision to car pool to the college and take a bus onto campus. This means it was difficult to leave and ride sharing wasn't big then. And I was poor. 

Turned out they were too full that day so I couldn't take my test but I had to wait four fucking hours for everyone else to do it. 

I passed the time by learning that I very much like Fritos chili pie flavor and sprite (there were vending machines) and listening to Isis Panopticon (See YouTube). 

Isis Panopticon is what the kids these days call ""shoe gaze."" I won't explain why because I don't actually know. 

But for me it was an acquired taste. It's thinking music. You draw, drive or relax while listening and it's sort of like guided meditation. 

Perhaps it's also good for looking at your shoes and that's where the name comes from but I think that's silly. 

Meditation has often been easy for me. I hear it isn't for other people. Basically it's like flexing a muscle. You try either not to think or to think on something specific and when your mind inevitably wonders, you bring it back. Lather, rinse, repeat. 

So this is what I did and I discovered that when you control your mind better, time can be a surprisingly subjective thing. Your imagination will also improve with this type of practice. 

I also passed my dumb test eventually and so did my friends. 

I like learning things and sharing stuff with other people. 

I hope you're alright. I read some comments that say you aren't afraid of dying there, but it's creepy and you're alone so don't let the men in white coats take you. 

Also search ""purple mommy"" in Reddit. There's a good spooky story about a little girl telling her parents about a ghost called this, and I'm certain the spook will be enhanced by your atmosphere, if you're into that sort of thing.

Edit: actually here because reddits search algorithm sucks:

Uuuuuuuuuuummmmm.....

Did you know that most near death experiences don't include a hellscape? Most people have positive experiences with death, and even if it begins as scary or painful it turns into a soothing experience, which I find very comforting but of course I am a little strange. 

Okay I hope that's enough to keep you entertained for a little while. And I do hope you make it home soon and have a warm bath and/or tea. An update on your safety would make me feel better. Good luck kiddo.

qsw3n3,"Don't go northwest! If the station sign says Sippiciano, you're almost certainly at Sippiciano station, not Sippiciano S Nicola. It's half an hour east of town, not 6 minutes southeast.

Also a lot safer/easier to walk from, even if further, because Sippiciano station appears to be on a road, wheras Sippiciano S Nicola you apparently have to find a path through the bush to get to the nearest road. Maybe it's obvious if you're there. At any rate, probably not relevant for Sippiciano station.

dte5j5,"Here's a fun story that just happened to me:

In line with my then girlfriend, waiting for our items to be sent through the xray. I sneakily put an engagement ring (in its box) next to my shoes so my girlfriend can't see it - the plan is to propose to her in Death Valley. We get up to the TSA person who looks at my stuff, spots what is easily recognizable a box that has some sort of jewelry in it, opens it for all to see and says in a loud sing-song voice ""OoOoOoOohhHhhhh whhhhaaaaatttt's thisssssss?!?""

I swear to you all I have never stared daggers harder into anyone in my entire life. It took everything I had not to slap a bitch, I was fuming. With my eyes I tell her to ""PUT THE MOTHER FUCKING RING DOWN AND SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" She quickly understands - I wish WISH I could see the surveillance footage of my facial expressions.

Somehow my girlfriend was too busy taking her items out (not only did she have her purse but also her digital camera and other things which they require you to take out of the case, etc) and she magically didn't hear or see what just went down. She had wondered why I was in such a bad mood at the airport when we were leaving for vacation but I held on to a glint of hope that maybe she didn't see, maybe she didn't hear. Thank god I stood by that. Can you imagine proposing in the TSA line? Jesus freaking Christ I hate TSA.

Anyways, we climbed Telescope Peak in DVNP and now we're happily engaged 😃",2019-11-08 15:44:11
dte5j5,"Imagine being military personnel, in uniform, traveling with your Military Working Dog, who is trained to attack and find bombs...and the TSA put you and your dog in a holding area for an hour because you can't legally let them ""pat down the dog to look for explosives or weapons""...and you're credentialed as an LEO while traveling...and you carry the TSA regulation saying you and your K9 are free to move through security as an LEO without going through normal security...because you have a fucking dog who's trained to attack and find bombs...that's the TSA.

Both had presented the appropriate TSA required medical cards & documentation, yet their own protocol is insufficient 🤦🏻‍♀️

My mother was even subjected to a degrading strip search despite this paperwork.  For my father they told him he had to ""sit and wait here"" after they checked him out.  The agent then went on break. There was hell to pay and fortunately both occasions resulted in favorable outcome for my parents.  As favorable as it can get after the aforementioned and missing flights. Each time happened to be travel for a funeral, so it made it that much worse.  

And yes, they arrived well beyond the recommended times as they anticipated some delay due to their medical issues.

I took the advice of Reddit and signed up with MeetUp. After scouring groups to join, I found one in my age bracket that meets up to potluck and watch movies.

The group looked friendly and up my alley. A requirement was you had to first message the group founder/leader and introduce yourself, send your photo, and say why you wanted to join the group. 

I wrote something brief but friendly and said I’m excited to get to know everyone and make new friends in this new city.

cu29l8,"Never said go out and buy the most expensive car.....   Used EVs can be had for under $10K that still drive like new, if their limited range meet their needs.   Add up the costs after 5 years and see what was spent on gas and maintenance, depends on where one lives, if one requires high octane premium unleaded, etc.  If it makes sense go for it, if it doesn’t, then it don’t.  Stepping things up a bit to the same car class that just burned down, buying a ~$30K gasoline car can be the roughly same  total cost equivalent of buying a ~$50K EV over the years. As for battery longevity, thermally managed batteries (eg Tesla) can last for hundreds of thousands of miles, even longer than a gas engine.   And EVs generally have better crash safety, too. Used Tesla Model 3s are coming into the market.... 

And I totally agree: an off-road EV would be truly bitchin’.   👍🏻  just imagine how awesome things will be for us within a decade, price wise.  Only wish that helped them now....",2019-08-23 02:01:04

>if you're the type of person that's got tattoos absolutely everywhere, million piercings and body mods like implants I can get it. You're into the scene and like to push the limits. You look like a freak show already so why the fuck not

Just the fact that you assume someone with piercings/tattoos is trying to look like ""a freak show"" is completely incomprehensible.

>I don't know why you're offended anyway...I doubt anybody who actually looked like what I'm talking about would be offended in the slightest

You doubt anyone who has piercings and tattoos would be offended? Where did that conclusion come from? In what world is ""freak show"" not an insult?

>I doubt they're hugely invested in what other people think. And good for them for doing their thing and not giving a fuck. I called them freak shows out of endearment. Freaks are awesome. It's only a negative thing if you want it to be
 
The only thing you didn't get wrong is that I'm not ""hugely invested"" in what you think. But that doesn't mean I'm going to just watch you talk shit about people who look like me and not tell you off.

Freak show is not a term of endearment. It's a negative thing because it's a negative term. I like looking different, but it doesn't make me a ""freak"". 

But it's pretty clear you're the kind of person who just doesn't care about anyone else's feelings, so I'm not going to waste my time telling you how fucked up what you said is. But thanks for making insane assumptions and just generally being as ass 👍",2019-02-22 01:59:50

Are you able to replace your door frame and door with re-enforced versions.

Sad that you even have to think this but you could look into making it so he can’t get in through your door or so it slows him down long enough to exhaust/hurt himself attempting to get in.

Family is a hard thing to deal with, all those complicated interpersonal relationships.

I hope you understand that as hard as it might be sometimes it’s better for your own health to completely cut people out of your life.

Deep down you love your brother *but* you can both love somebody and hate the same person at the same time.

Being stressed all the time by hating someone is not good for your health.

Speaking of hate, I don’t know your brother only what you have posted.

But from the picture you have painted he’s a very, very angry person filled with hate his choice of property possibly shows it was a deliberate.

ec9fex,"My sister’s phone got “stolen” at a store when she put it down for a min to look at some stuff. Tracked the phone to a house couple of blocks away, then called the police because I had heard they might be able to help get the phone if it was stolen and located somewhere.  

Well the police did knock on the house , but of course no one knew anything about a stolen phone .Police politely told me that asking was the only thing they could do and to consider the phone gone.  I thanked them for their service, but before telling my sister to start saving for a new phone I left a message with the “lost phone” feature  saying “Santa Ana PD has tracked this phone and will pursue legal action to recover it. Please return or call 714********”
 
Next day I got a call saying “ bro we found your phone please come pick it up “ and we meet at the store where they took my sis’ phone. Sure enough a “bro” wearing a tank top and shades pulled up in a truck , gave it to me and said “hey bro let the police know you found it, my homies house got raided yesterday” and I had to try my hardest to keep a straight face saying “ will inform the authorities right away sir”

all the leftovers went into sausage. intestines, eyes, brains, etc. if you accidentally sliced off your finger while cutting meat, it went into the sausage. they poisoned the rats so they died. guess where those went?

now, the grossest of all, the way they killed the animals: they bonked them in the head with a sledgehammer. (imagine hearing them cry 😭😭) since cows have thick skulls, if they didnt instantly die, then they could trample you.

Thing is, he not only tore it open and ate the bread, he ate the plastic bag AND the twist tie along with it. And never “passed” either one. Trust me, we looked.

bnna3f,"Alright, guess I'll get in on this.


Starting off with the fact that I lucked out. I have a wonderful father who is still in my life today. I love him very much.


My mom, though? She wasn't in my life for a very long time and I always wondered why. My dad never talked badly about her and would always answer with something like ""that's just life,"" when I asked where she was.


Just before my 13th birthday, my dad noticed that the no mom situation was starting to bother me more and he tracked her down. I met her about a month before my birthday and everything was good or so it seemed. Found out that I had an older half-brother (tbf I knew about this one) and a younger half-sister. I thought that this was my chance to have an honest to goodness family. Less than a month later, and before my birthday even came up, she picked up and moved, changed her number and never contacted me or my dad again. Why? Because my dad didn't want to have sex with her.


I've tried on a few occasions to have a relationship with my brother and sister but everytime I do, my mom makes everything difficult. I've decided to just leave it alone. I'm an uncle now and I've only seen my nephew on the day he was born because, even on the day that had nothing to do with her, my mom made me visiting  all about herself and started a bunch of drama. 🤷‍♂️",2019-05-12 18:54:31

bnna3f,"Yeah when I was 15/16 and getting my first job my parents got me a credit card - $1200 limit, couldn’t do that much damage. They also instructed me to use it once a month for a meal or something then pay it off. That’s basically what I did, since I knew they were looking at the statements at that point. When I got out of college I had a small but decent credit history, and was able to put a down payment on a house way earlier than many of my peers because of that. 

Course then I fucked it up by marrying Bipolar Disorder Personified who lied about paying a bunch of bills and used all our money on bullshit instead of paying the mortgage for awhile so 🙄🙄 

But thanks in large part to my parents good example I’m back on track and I still have that original credit card that I keep around for emergencies.",2019-05-12 14:16:53

I know this might not be the place to disclose such information, but I don't know who to talk to. You may take this comment with a grain of salt, but thank you. I needed to hear this today. This definitely helped reduce some of the anxiety I've been having.

Edit: I never thought I would get so many responses, thank you guys so much. It really helps a lot and I feel glad to know I'm not facing life's problems alone.

anr51p,"The only thing I ever remember hitting up when I worked on food service was when the breakfast buffet closed down. Some items could be re-used or repurposed (today’s fresh sausage is crumbled up and used to make tomorrow’s gravy, and some of the unused bacon winds up on burgers, for instance), but some of the bread products had no other use and were going to be thrown away, and the management turned a blind eye to letting us eat those. The cinnamon and sugar french toast sticks were a particular favorite.

She finally got ahold of someone who could speak English better and they told her shed have to wait 7-14 more days after filing a case. The next time she saw the fedex driver she literally followed him to our neighbors house and confronted him, and he said he remembered the package but not where he delivered it to 🤣🤣🤣 my mom was so pissed. -- No we have not gotten the package or received a refund :) 
Oh and once she watched the same driver pull up to our neighbors house and DROP OUR PACKAGE OFF AT THEIR HOUSE 😂",2021-11-25 07:06:37

I don’t pay anything, the neighbor will have to pay the tow truck company. They are notorious for essentially holding your car hostage unless you pay a lot of money, so it does suck getting your car towed, which I acknowledge. But I couldn’t get to work until the car was gone.

It was very apparent I couldn’t drive out of my own driveway, so their parking job was completely illegal. The policeman called the tow company after trying to knock on their door, and calling them a number of times. They didn’t answer 🤷‍♂️",2023-05-10 17:53:52

First off, verifying whether someone has a degree is incredibly easy to do and a lot (if not most) companies will do so from the get go.

Even if you do slip through, it’s not unheard of for companies to verify resumes and degrees after you’ve already been working for months or even years. There are even cases for CEOs that got fired for falsifying information. And if they find out you bet your ass you’re getting terminated instantly. If that’s a risk you’re willing to take, go for it, but this is unequivocally bad advice to give people.",2019-07-01 18:44:09

My auntie got so annoyed at me that I kept ignoring her whenever she spoke to me (she’s nuts, that’s why I didn’t give a shit) so she grabbed my Xbox out of the wall and smashed it to pieces in my driveway. My mom stood there and didn’t even do anything about it. I got so pissed off to the point that not only would I get her back but I would harass her relentlessly by calling her demanding a new one. A week went by and she came back to my house to confront me about how many times I spam called her (over 200 something calls across the week lmao) and I told her I’d only stop if she’d compensate me for the damage but she just brushed it off and said “I deserved it.” So I waited until that night came around and I went to her house and actually set fire to her car. The phone call I got the next day was so funny I pretty much just took my victory with me and blocked her number. Still not talking to her to this day and it’s been over 4 years. 🤷🏼‍♀️",2022-07-13 02:39:41

We grilled all sorts of meat.  Then we lived off pantry foods.  We had water, snacks and booze.  After a hurricane the wind stays strong for a while so we opened all the windows.  On the last day town had power again so we took super quick cold showers(our tiny community has a generator for the community well's water pump) and headed to grab a bite.  The kids wanted McDonald's and we wanted Mexican.  They allowed us to bring in the kids happy meals and we ordered them a giant ice cream each.  We sat there appreciating the climate control and good food.  Everyone was in such a great mood.  We walked the neighborhood often while power was out and helped clean up random sticks from our neighbors yards.  Sometimes losing power is not all that bad.  Everyone was also so relieved the hurricane passed without flooding, knocking over too many trees, or causing a lot of damage so the mood was thankful and happy.  When the power crew drove by and fixed our lines we cheered and thanked them.  💚💚💚 We played so many board games with the kids too.  Candles in the evening.  It was like camping but better.

But like 10-15 years ago my grandparents got a bunch of plumbing upgrades and she doesn't do that plug thing anymore and the washing machine water goes into the drain it's supposed to.

Many years back I moved into a downtown apartment and couldn’t get a garage spot. Due to the nature of my job, I’d get called in randomly (I worked down the street) and ended up getting distracted from moving my car because I had to put fires out at work. 

Before I got a garage spot I had accumulated like 12 parking tickets. At the time, you had to pay them all off to get your registration. My registration was $1200. 

Was it avoidable to some degree? Sure, but cities don’t make it easy sometimes.

Also I eventually got towed because of not having up-to-date registration which made the final cost somewhere around $2800 to get my car back. More than it was worth.

That was a rough year 😪

I had a neighbor in my old apartment that was an older gentleman named Don and he was a crabby, hilarious SOB, and he used to joke about all the metal in his body from an accident he had. Basically there wasn't a part of him that wasn't reconstructed somehow. Had to be air lifted from the scene. He was an inspiration though! He had developed an addiction to pain medications but had pulled through in time to save his marriage. He was a cool guy! I'd run into him and say ""Good morning Don, how's it going?"", and he would just give me a toothy grin and say droningly ""Still alive"". Funny dude.

1cpp50v,"Happy Birthday From Toronto Canada!

I wanted to reach out and send some positive vibes your way. 

I know it must have been disappointing that your friends couldn't make it, but I want you to remember all the wonderful things you have going for you.

*Birthdays are a celebration of you – your uniqueness, your strengths, and the incredible journey you are on.*

 Sometimes, life throws us curveballs, but these moments can also be opportunities to turn the page and discover new friendships and experiences.

You have the chance to explore new interests, meet new people, and build connections that will bring joy to you. 

You have so much to offer the world, and the *right friends* who truly appreciate you are out there, waiting to meet you.

Wishing you all the happiness, growth, and new adventures in this next chapter of your life. 

Keep shining bright! ✨✨😊",2024-05-11 22:17:33

The material of the dog appears to be iron, meaning while it's small, it'd still weigh a bit. Add in velocity from a fall and you've likely got a broken tile, or at least dented flooring.

Ah yes, its well known that every bug is fixed instantaneously the second multiple reports of the same thing are listed. Its not like I listed one that is currently in a preview build to be fixed months after it was broken for instance, because like you said, windows never breaks anything and everyone except you is incompetent 👌

>If you can prove it caused issues with your business, they'll cut you a check.

>As everyone is aware, the Whitford family faith healer, Pastor Benny Hinn, is a little busy right now fighting some false accusations, so my husband, Mr. Whitford, went to a secular ""doctor"" on Friday for a slight cough he has. While there, the ""physician"" said that while Mr. Whitford appears to be a healthy, robust man, it wouldn't hurt him to have a ""physical"" to ensure everything's ""working okay"".
My husband was wary as he rightfully doesn't trust quacks who don't have a solid creation science background, and when he was asked to strip down to his underwear he started to get concerned. However, everything seemed to be going alright so Mr. Whitford started to let his guard down.
>Then it happened. The ""doctor"" said he wanted to give my husband a prostate exam. When this deviant explained what is involved, my husband roared in horror, punched the pervert who was coming on to him, and hightailed it out of there!
>The punchline? Mr. Whitford is the one who got arrested and is sitting in jail for ""assault"" as I write this! He wasn't sure about sharing his embarrassing story, but now that he hasn't been able to get released in time for church, he figured it will help serve as a warning for all decent heteros*xual True Christian™ men and so he told me to come tell the tale here with the added apologies of allowing me in the men's forum.

>Now for the horrifying part. Please don't read any further without girding yourself in the Armor of God and praying to avoid disturbing mental images!

>According to the ""doctor"", a ""prostate exam"" involves him STICKING HIS FINGER UP A MAN'S BACKSIDE! ￼

>Leviticus 18:22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.

>Romans 1:26-27 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

>If any man tells you he has to stick his finger up your backside to ""ensure you are healthy"", RUN! Run as fast as you can! No sane man wants to stick his finger up another man's backside, and if you let them start there, there is no telling where it will lead!

>Thank you, and once again my husband and I both apologize for me posting in the men's forum.",2019-02-05 12:45:56

But dang I’m sorry that happened to you. I’m a Minnesotan as well.

To add, I had no proper gear. I didn’t even have snow pants (we went on a whim and he assured me my leggings would be fine, but really he just wanted to go and didn’t care).

They put on their dreary looking outfits and took out their signs, and  ate their food and went onto the street corner to beg, felt cheated.

I won’t be shocked if he’s looking for something they can both survive on. Of course he could’ve been just giving you a hard time. I stopped trying to figure out the complete thought processes of those panhandling. Especially when I see 20/20 exposes people that live in the suburbs and drive into urban areas with drab clothes to panhandle that tax free money.

Funny coincidence, my teen daughter just performed as Miss Shields in the local kids acting company's show of THE MUSICAL VERSION. I didn't think I liked musicals, and I am biased but the musical version of this movie is so good. 

 It was game-changing. It is so cute, cheery, and silly. Her best friend and boyfriend played the parents too. It was hysterical seeing her boyfriend playing that dorky dad with an anger management issue was such a highlight with his MAJOR AWARD 🎶.  There were leg lamp dancers galore. I got a picture with one afterwards. There is so much more to tell but I won't make you read all of it.

I am still reeling over the musical version of A Christmas Story! Possibly bc my daughter performed in one, but the leg lamp is unforgettable either way!",2019-12-21 04:57:39

I wanted to impress my parents with how well I was doing and was Smart™,  so I asked for them to ""pass the condoms""... Aka the condiments.

fj1fjt,"Well that sucks squared.

1. Sucks that people are so stupid they let the fish die.
2. Sucks that some of the stupid people are in this thread claiming that fish don’t need oxygen.

Edit: I just wanted to clarify that I’m not saying that people who don’t know fish need oxygen are stupid. We all have gaps in our knowledge and it has little to do with stupidity.

There were people arguing strongly that fish don’t need oxygen to survive. Not knowing something is one thing but arguing from a position of ignorance IS stupid. Hello all you anti-vaxxers, flat Earth conspiracists and climate change deniers. We love you 😘",2020-03-15 16:17:10

It's no easy thing to manage, much less overcome. It has so many forms it can take, too. Add social anxiety in the mix and it's even worse. Socializing in general is EXHAUSTING. After an adoption event, I go home and go to bed. At 6pm. I always say it's just a nap, but then I don't get out of bed til Sunday morning. Having to deal with customers on a daily basis had to have been draining for you.

Duuuuude. Now you make me wish you were one of my neighbors! This is kicking our asses. I've already reached out to our neighbors on Nextdoor for old blankets and towels (who knew puppies need so many baths???) and I'm stealing our adoption coordinator's favorite teen helper on Wednesday and Thursday. My neighbor and her daughter are pitching in, too. Here's some puppy tax for you, at least!

If I ever saw even just a single black widow inside my car or my house or wherever... On my life, I wouldn't even be capable of concentrating in any way, or on any level. Period . LMAO if I saw this I'm my vehicle my car would be sold tomorrow!! 

Be safe my friend...  I know I'm kidding around but on a serious level, Black Widows are highly venomous, if you are bitten just once it can and will make you very sick, and not to mention extremely painful... And this pain will last for a long duration! Without proper medical attention immediately you can die from it.. but as a bare minimum it will make you absolutely miserable and can have other permanently damaging issues. Be safe 👍✌️",2022-10-10 23:41:12

b7bg46,"“A lot of people who have depression aren't even aware that they suffer from it because of how normal everything starts to feel.”

This is true of many mental illnesses. I saw a psychiatrist 7 years after experiencing a traumatic event which I believed I had overcome and actually had no relevance to that particular visit because I had mostly forgotten about it; I had been operating under the impression that it was normal to avoid certain places/things and have an elevated heart rate and blood pressure doing specific everyday tasks, because that was what I had become used to. The only reason it even came up in our conversation was because I had recently had to do the scary thing at the scary place and how silly I felt I reacted was on my mind. He diagnosed it as PTSD, though I still question it because it doesn’t seem to affect me all that much... as long as I avoid certain places and situations I’m totally fine. 😅

But the point is, most mental illnesses are really hard to notice on your own; we all operate as if we are doing our absolute best to and are functioning normally until an unbiased third party points out what, to them, seems obvious and illuminates an issue you never realized existed and now, by recognizing it, you can finally start to overcome, or at least work around it.",2019-03-30 18:57:54

b7bg46,"Depression can fucking suck. Losing a job can fucking suck. Hell losing at anything sucks. But you know what you haven’t lost yet? Your ability and opportunity to live life. 

And even better... live the life you want to live. All you have to do is have a plan. Start from there. Right now I’m sure you’re more focused on the fact that you’ve lost your job and maybe even all hope. But once you start to have a plan and say “okay the worst is over, now what?”, that’s when you’ll start to see things improve. Set some goals! They can start off small like getting out of bed for example. Then say okay, I want to get some exercise. You could go for a walk or run, lift weights, shoot a basketball. Trust me, everyone feels a lot better after some exercise. 

Once you’ve regained some confidence and feeling a little more positive, work on putting in some applications. It doesn’t have to be for your dream job right away, it could even be some local minimum wage job temporarily. Just try to get your mojo back and work on bettering your life. It more than likely won’t happen over night but just keep telling yourself that things have no other choice but to get better and they will once you make that initial effort. 

Stay strong my friend. You’re not the only one to feel like this or be in this situation and just like many others do, you’re going to shake this off and get back on your feet. ✌️ ",2019-03-31 00:16:23

b7bg46,"I'm a life long sufferer diagnosed with major depressive disorder,  generalized anxiety disorder and anhedonia.  I've been suicidal,  I was a cutter and I had a battle with substance abuse.  But the crazy thing is I've been helped. Which seems so alien to me,  but it's actually possible. 

So I'm not completely ""cured"" Or anything but I live a happy life now. Like I really do and just typing that makes me tear up just because it's been such a painful fucking road.  Oh my God it wears you down and eats you. But I am happy now, which is totally strange to say but it's really true. 

 I did a year and a half of cognitive therapy,  I stared seeing a therapist,  I took classes on depression and trauma.  The big thing was the psychiatrist.  We tried sooooo many combinations of meds.  Trial and error,  always swapping out and testing what works.  It was determined that I am treatment resistant.  I was afraid no combination of any medications would work for me. 

Then my doctor decided to try a hail Mary and prescribe an MAOI inhibitor.  Doctors don't prescribe these drugs anymore, for the most part.  It's because you can't eat certain foods while on the meds.  Like I cant eat soy,  or beef jerky or take cough syrup.  I can't eat hard cheeses and deli meats.  Because if I do I could die.  Its unlikely, but possible.  And I did accidentally eat a bunch of soy before and had a reaction that scared me a bit.  But that is the trade off.  You take the med but give up a few different foods.  The list is not long for the foods and I learned to be more careful after eating some soy.  Most people aren't as absent minded as I am. 

He put me on parnate at first. This is the world's strongest anti-depressive medication.  It existed before all our modern depression and anxiety medications.  But they phased them out long ago because of the food factor.  But see food is much different than it was when these meds started phasing out.  I can't remember what it was inside the food exactly that you are supposed to avoid but apparently our modern food has much much Lower concentrations of it than in the past.  And other people I've spoken to about these meds don't even watch what they eat.  I eat food with soy in it all the time. I had a reaction because I ate actual soy sauce with some sushi and I did so because I simply forgot to avoid it.  

I'm digressing a bit but the point is that MAOI inhibitors aren't prescribed but once in a blue moon because they used to be much more dangerous than they are today and most doctors have a stigma on these meds.  But my doctor understood that the risk of these meds is highly exaggerated.  I started on parnate and the meds took a while to become effective.  It took about a month and a half but couod take a little bit longer v for some.  So when the med started working I had feelings I haven't had since I was a child.  Imagine that shit!  Imagine feeling genuinely happy after not having that for years and years and years!  Suddenly I wanted to talk to other people instead of avoid them.  Suddenly I'm not thinking of ways I think I could kill myself while at work anymore.  Think about that contrast.  If your like I was I know what your going through.  I know how everyday you wish your life would hurry up and be over with.  But you know that killing yourself would devastate your family so you never actually do it but you just beg to yourself that you wish it was over.  I wanted to be gone for years.  I cried every day all day and had to keep my composure at work and I was tired of it.  

So to feel genuine happiness was FUCKING PROFOUND.  I didn't even think it was possible.  And over the years I forgot what it felt like to be happy.  And it's so very nice.  I envy others that get to feel contentment in their lives with out having to struggle with anxiety and depression.  Our disease is so fucking harsh.  It's literally a terminal illness and the symptoms are some of the worst in the world. 

However this would not be my final solution.  Yes the depression and anxiety was lifting,  but their were side effects that were soooooo bad.  But see,  I had rare side effects that was not something most people have.  Parnate usually gives people energy,  not makes them tired.  Unfortunately I was one of the rare cases where it made me so very exhausted.  And cold!  Oh my god I was in a jacket all day every day because I got some strange cold reaction.  And finally it gave me insomnia.  That was the worst side effect for me simply because I absolutely hate insomnia.  It bothers me to no end to not be able to sleep at night.  

But see it was worth it.  Like very very worth it.  Yes I suffered some nasty side effects but we are talking about relief from depression for fuck sake.  Almost any side effect is worth that.  But my doctor wasn't satisfied.  There is another MAOI inhibitor that is very similar but reacts a bit differently.  Nardil over at the social anxiety sub Reddit is considered the holy grail of medicines.  Many people know about the med over there but very few are on it.  Why?  Because of the stigmas attached to MAOI inhibitors.  The diet involved. 

Nardil changed my life.  

I owe my entire life to a medication that I consider to be a fucking miracle.  For those of you that do not get any benefit from all other anti-depressive medications,  you might want to look into MAOI inhibitors.  I'm not a doctor so I cant really give advice and tell anyone to take these meds.  But I would recommend just reading some testimonials from people that have had their lives turned around from these meds.  Seriously,  you hardly ever hear anything negative about these meds other than people getting mad because their doctor wont prescribe them. 

What you will hear a lot of is people referring to MAOI inhibitors as miracles.  They really were for me.  I genuinely thought it was a wrap for me.  Never in my heart did I comprehend ever feeling happy.  But after taking nardil I'm not scared of people anymore,  in not nearly depressed like I was,  my anxiety is 90 percent gone.  I ended up getting employee of the month and then recently just got promoted to a supervisor.  That could not have happened when I was scared,  anxious and wishing I was dead. 

I have no plans on ever stopping this med.  I know some people hate the idea of taking meds the rest of their life but I honestly could care less when my quality if life has gone from wishing I was dead to literally enjoying my life.  This is symptom management and I'd do way more than take a med if I had to.  But know that everyone is different and your solution may be different than my solution.  For some a different med may work.  Maybe cardio is what works for you.  Also cognitive therapy is a big one and one of the best non-med solution.  Cognitive therapy is a more modern therapy and for some its a life saver.  

Just know that it's not hopeless.  There is a solution out there for you.  You just need to solve that riddle.  Once you get your answer,  you will be thankful to yourself for hanging in there and looking for a solution.  Now I cry tears of happiness when I think of where I am compared to where I've come from.  It's like a trek across the galaxy but I made it. 

Tldr: the medication called Nardil is a miracle that has changed my life 🙂.

vr7xhh,"My mam was diagnosed with a meningioma back in 2011. Scary thing was she knew nothing about it, no symptoms. It was picked up in an eye test because the optician could see a tiny speck of blood when looking at her eyes. They told her to cancel what she was doing the rest of that day and go straight to the hospital.

The doctors said it had likely been there for a long, long time because it was very big and apparently these tumours grow very slowly.

Thankfully she underwent surgery not long after and they removed ""99.9%"" of it. She recovered well and all you can really see of it now is a bit of the scar on the back of her neck just below her hairline (she has always had short hair).

These guys are miracle workers and you're in the best possible hands. I am sure you will come out of this fine. 🙂 Take care and wishing you all the best and a speedy recovery my friend.",2022-07-05 00:21:53

We have lots of memories of being shit faced together and now that we are parents and have our life sorted out we look back and laugh. I think my favorite was when I blacked out and me and him were about 6 miles from home and we had to hoof it. He was just slightly less drunk than me and was the guide, ended up walking in a massive circle around the city block and I was wandering off getting lost. Made my way to someone's front yard and laid down and the sprinklers came on,  He had to grab me and carry me for a while. He said it took us over 2 hrs to make it home, I just remembered waking up sitting down with a 711 hotdog in my hand and the sun coming up and I was cold and wet and we were maybe 30 mins from home.

Handing back their assignments I graded, here ya go new kid."" (He couldn't even learn my name 🙄) You start handing papers back and you are doing okay. But then as your confidence begins to build you come across a paper with the name ""La-ia"" You pause and think of your options but with 30ish sets of eyes staring right at you you begin to get nervous and in your head say ""Fuck it"" and just shout the first idea that pops in your head... ""LaEahhh"" you continue to shout it a solid 5 times until a young girl in the back looks up from her notebook and says ""Girl its La-Dash-EE-Ahh, its pretty simple, like seriously. Like why can't anyone ever get it right. Its 4 letters."" And from that point forward in life your confidence level has never risen past where it was that day when you were calling out Brians, Davids and Saras like it was what you were put on this earth to do. Because every thing you do in this life it will go from Sara to La-ia real quick. #stayhumblefolks",2019-12-30 09:20:46

I’m surprised it didn’t walk off on’em 😅…but on a serious note, if they weren’t wearing masks when they opened that door, all those spores, maybe even black mold ones, have been inhaled.

PPB is just lax about almost everything and there aren't enough of them. You're also right about the resources in Portland. But a lot of homeless people are homeless because of mental illness and you can't make people get treatment if they aren't interested. Portland has a lot of problems and it's not all due to homelessness. The rise in crime isn't exclusively even related to homelessness. There are too many people and it grew too fast.

I mean look at the clip.. what kinda evil would even allow you to use a personal day (most places don’t distinguish between what kinda day anymore) for weather like this? If your job isn’t to tackle weather like this(salt truck, weatherman etc), you should just wake up to an email saying “enjoy your day” or “work from home” at the very least..

Pure evil to make ppl scramble in this.. 😩

Edit: To the ppl more upset at me thinking I’m speaking this way because I have options, you’re proving my point! You’re more upset at me than your profession… the whole “business as usual” and “the show must go on” has been taken entirely too far.. 

I don’t want to pretend “the show must go on” should only apply to ppl dealing w/the weather (police, fire, etc etc) but your life comes b4 any production .. ANY PRODUCTION!

Only one doctor had heard of what he had and she unfortunately left when he was 9 (lifelong illness that he will always have).

She wouldn't let us make our own decisions for him, it always became a ""I wouldn't do this course of treatment on my child though I would do this other option so let's start there."" HOW ABOUT you tell ME the options and I choose for my own child? It's finally something more doctors know about, guess it became more common, but school staff is always thrown off when he gets sick at school and ask for the weirdest notes. He got fever blisters all over his ears in 3rd grade. They asked for a note that his ""ear herpes"" were not contagious. Entire clinic nurse staff took part in writing the note while laughing the entire time. Not only was it not ear herpes but they really wanted to know why the school nurse didn't know how herpes is spread.

There’s an opioid epidemic but the freedom to have something for pain and other issues is illegal at the federal level.  So many have a hard time affording medications due to insurance companies; a good chunk of ppl struggle to afford premiums that take a good chunk of their paychecks.  The working poor (ones who don’t qualify to be labeled as living in poverty) are a huge huge population.   Freedom to make medical choices for families is very undermined in some states with certain healthcare bills.  Seriously what rock are you living under that you aren’t aware of how reality is?

He's got the industrial fridge pulled away from the wall and there's a little dust in the corner. He points at it and absolute berates me in a mixture of English and Italian that would make Gordan Ramsey blush.

He told me to get the fuck out of his restaurant and never come back.

wki5j3,"You're right to be worried.

Everyone here is telling you that ""laced"" weed is rare, but only under the circumstances that people are imagining.

People think that the idea of laced weed is limited to nefarious drug dealers who want to get you hooked on PCP or something.  That doesn't happen.

The truth is that you don't know who handled that weed, and what other drugs they may have accidentally contaminated it with.

Fentanyl is so extremely powerful that if the previous owner of this weed rolled those joints on the same table that fentanyl was handled on, it could kill you.

Everyone wants to think that random weed is safe because ""weed smokers"" are good people.  But I can assure you that Heroin/fentanyl, and meth users also use weed.

Throw those in the trash, and I'll roll a J for you ❤️",2022-08-10 03:22:07

This is a bridge I drove 2 hours out of my way to AVOID because it is fucking terrifying to try to drive on- avoid if you drive a stick.)

For my bday he got me one, gave me this long speech about how I AM fully responsible for all of the puppy chores..training, feeding, picking up poop, etc. I think he thought I would lose interest when I saw how much work it would be. On the way home...doggo starts dry heaving... my fiancé says “IN MY JEEP?!?!” And I put my hands out and caught his throw up. My fiancé looked at me and said “...I was kidding, jeeps are made to get messy...” I knew this, but I felt I had to prove my loyalty and commitment. So, I rode the remaining 5, minutes with partially digested dog food cupped in my hands, and still to this day I am in charge of the dirty work. Totally worth it! Love my pucky!

gy0bca,"Not op and English is not my first language, but my son will be 11 months in 3 days, so the transition is just happening now. Ever since birth, he had really strong grip, and that is something all babies do, asi it is one of the reflexes they are born with. As they get older, they get develop their frontal lobe part of a brain. That's the part of a brain where you get do decide what you want to do, your ""free will"" part (the one that gets killed during lobotomy for example).
That means that babies need to lose their grip so they can for examole play with toys better, eat on their own.. my kid likes to pick up tiny rocks and eat them, so I guess that's his way of developing motoric skills 🤷🏼‍♂️.
As of older people, I can only guess that as they age, their brain capacity is worse and worse, until the point they're back to the basics, like the grip reflex for example.
To answer your question - I definitely would try to develop his skills according to his age. The kid will like to grab stuff and there's not really a way to discourage it, as he will not know better, and when the time comes, he will move on. Him grabbing things doesn't mean he will not develop further motoric skills. I hope I made it at least somewhat clear for you, and if you have any more questions, you can just dm me:-)",2020-06-07 09:07:31

10sy50v,You can’t really cook burgers the same as you cook steak. You can have steak different rarities due to the inside having no/little oxygen reaction for bacteria etc. so it doesn’t make you ill. Burgers on the other hand is meat that has been minced and shaped and therefore has a lot more contact with oxygen and bacteria so you have to be abit more careful with burgers.

eri8xl,"Mine grew in when I was 13 and I thought it was normal to have those molars..until my dentist said they had to come out lol I had no pain beforehand or anything to think they needed out, but turns out they were causing cavities on the nearby teeth, sooo at 14 I had mine out.
I remember everything of what I did after, even waking up in the middle of the procedure (and groaning really loud to let them know I was awake),waking up room/wheelchair ride and all

So yeah, good luck op!👌🏼",2020-01-21 03:28:17

Not sure what I want to do , but several people tell me I “have” to remove them sooner or later and the longer I wait the worse recovery will be 😒",2020-01-20 23:00:38

eri8xl,It falled down 😕,2020-01-21 00:06:39
eri8xl,I have had that procedure done... twice. The doctors both times were unable to get the 4 at once because of different reasons. So I lived through the agony of local anesthesia and recovery and dry sockets twice. Thank god they prescribed some Tramadol the second time around 🤤,2020-01-21 00:26:46

eri8xl,"Mine were exactly like this. Took a long time to recover. Had it done under local. Couldn’t eat for a long time. Whole face was swollen. Bled A LOT.

It’s also very common so doctors know what they’re doing 👍",2020-01-21 06:07:00

eri8xl,"I went under for removing my wisdom teeth but they also surgically uprighted my twelve year molars, which were also quite impacted, though they had erupted.

Suddenly having  more tooth is waaaay weirder than having no tooth where there's always been no tooth. 

Pity they didn't upright my 12s sooner though. All four had cavities / have large fillings where they sat against my 6s. 🙁",2020-01-21 01:21:51
eri8xl,"Oh good, you made me feel so much at ease... not!

My dentist made it sound so simple: I’ll just drill it in half. Take the crown out then pull the roots. No thank you 😖",2020-01-20 21:35:22
eri8xl,"Same, I cant afford to get them out. It would be $1200 for all 4 😅",2020-01-20 20:52:30
eri8xl,"Not a dentist but a victim of this because (1)my job gave me a hard time on the insurance and (2) company changed insurance. My dentist said I probably have a huge pain tolerance because he admitted that he wasn't sure if I was ""dead"" a few times (I was motionless and he couldn't tell if I was breathing). 

That being said I had to forgo the second tooth extraction and after two years I honestly regret it; constant pains worse than a headache and if eating and it gets hot with a solid, yeah it WILL HURT WORSE THAN A PUNCH!!!

I don't mind dentists but I hate having to have fought to get my original removal done. I went with extractions versus root canals because it was just more affordable despite the problems with that. Also I have an unemployed family member 😩 so saving is hard for oral surgery on the side I didn't have treated. 

Listen to the dentist; it will suck but it literally took less than 2 years for me to really regret it. If it's affordable, even if inconvenient, it's really so so much better than you will want to imagine. 

Fyi: I also had a tooth removed without anesthesia in another country (long story) and I'd rather do that all over again with my current tooth issue if it was free, pain and all 🥺",2020-01-21 07:31:23

eri8xl,"I had my top left erupt normal and in line, but it kept rubbing the inside of my cheek and caused me to hold my jaw in a weird position to make it stop. I ended up with a locked jaw because of it and it was insanely painful to get removed, so even then it can go south real quick 😕",2020-01-21 02:12:26

9dv1ty,The comments here are just as good as the OP. I'm so sorry. To everyone. I let one go (a TINY one!) while at a sleepover when I was about 14. Of course my loud-mouthed friend was the only one awake. At 3:30 am. Called me out right then and there. She had no shame. I hope she never changed. Here's to my 4-H girls! 💖 😂,2018-09-08 19:02:17

My entire family came to my baby shower though. Im still hurt they didn't want to celebrate all my hardwork and getting my degree but they want to celebrate getting pregnant that doesn't take much work at all.

Edit to say that your mom is awesome. Neither of my parents came to my graduation party. Your mom showed up and thats 💯 👌",2022-05-22 03:24:32

I had done everything really fancy and even pulled out my mothers treasured china for serving ware.
I dumped everything in my kitchen sink. It sat there forever. I was so hurt.
I no longer count on any of those people and life is so much better.

uv0f6j,I never understood inviting random classmates to parties? I thought parties were for friends so I never really questioned why I never had one or was invited to any.

I am sure that these last few years weren't easy and all the young people deserve credit for that, you have had a rough time already. Some people have lots of friends but parents who don't care, it looks like you are loved and have a great family so you already have the important part for your age nailed. Now, you have the rest of your life to invent yourself. Go out into this wild world safely and remember the goodness that surrounds you. Never go to the dark side, although it may seem tempting, always remember where you come from....a loving supportive family. The world will be cruel again at some time when least expecting it but you will be ready because of your foundation. Take the world on with your head held high and I promise your family WILL ALWAYS be proud of you, if you are proud of yourself. Take care, stay strong and even though I'm someone else's mom, I too am really proud of you. I know it wasn't easy peasy....You earned it!! ❤❤",2022-05-22 03:50:17

I threw my son a birthday party when he turned 5 at a pizza spot with a huge playground. My family members didn’t even show up and I ALWAYS went to their kid’s parties. That event mixed with me never having birthday parties resulted in none of my kids getting a party again. I refuse to have their little hearts broken. At least I can accept that people are busy with Christmas but their birthday dates are pretty much inexcusable. I take them anywhere they want and let them spend as much as they want. They’ve never complained.

Edit: For those mentioning Ehlers, I have a non-blood relative with a mild form (no dislocations, but pain & mitral valve issues). And my teen niece, who has some hyperflexibility, has been asked about the possibility of a family history. But based on everything I've read (in support of the non-blood relative), I don't think it fits for me?  I'm somewhat flexible, have autoimmune/inflammation issues, fibro and bloodwork that suggests the possibility of future lupus or scleroderma, so maybe I'm just a clod with some other coincidental issues.

We look again and it turns out it was a momma possum and a bunch of her babies.

cemke7,"I have a story:

About 6 or so years back, I was living with my parents who are not very hygenic or clean people. I was watching a movie in the living room at night and decided I was hungry and wanted a snack. I walked into the pantry and grabbed the only open bag of chips I see; Cool Ranch Doritos. They were never a chip of preference but I was hungry, whatever. Got back out into the dark living room, unpaused my movie and continued watching. Eating my Doritos, I thought they tasted weird. I figured maybe they were a bit stale cause the bag wasnt closed with a clip. That or perhaps Cool Ranch was worse than I remembered. Didn't matter to me though, I was hungry and had a movie to watch. Ninety minutes later the movie ended, the bag was almost empty and I figured I may as well finished them off. Turned the lights on and grabbed my bag and looked in to grab a, potentially remaining, unbroken Dorito. To my horror, HUNDREDS of ants were crawling around the inside of the bag. No exaggeration, there were hundreds in the bottom of the bag. I can't imagine how many I consumed. They weren't tint ants either, they were those big bodied ants!

To this day I have ""bag of chips n ants"" PTSD, and always have to check an open bag before eating any 😂",2019-07-18 06:45:05

s7egpj,"Haha, ive been dealing with this issue for the past 9 almost 10 years. Live in NYC in a decent apartment. Since every corner of my building has these cockroaches it makes no difference if you get an exterminator or not :/. In my first year of living in NYC i hated these things and called the exterminator atleast 13 times. And another 4 times the second year. Then i realized that it was hopeless and now i am watching one crawl on the wall as i type this. As much as i hate to say this, i legit started to play around with them. I use them as target practice with a rubber band and paper balls 🤦‍♂️ i can kill a thousand a day and it will make no difference. It prolly sounds disgusting to everyone but ui when you cant afford better you make friends with cockroaches and just learn to live with them. Before i had a cat whenever i was in a sad or bad mood i would legit just take a cockroach on my hand and talk to it to spill out my feelings and then proceed to slap it with a slipper. It prolly sounds very odd and it is but 😔 what can i do lol (and no my house isnt really filthy, these guys dont need filth to survive, they just need very little to survive and multiply like gremlins. Idk where they even get the food to survive let alone multiply, as long as i live in this building they will always be there for me)",2022-01-19 07:13:05

I had a very small cat (petite, if you will). She liked to hunt the various bugs and mice that run rampant throughout the city. But I didn’t want her to actually eat any city mice, because who knows wtf they’re carrying or if they’ve been poisoned.
So, one morning….I see her pounce on something. Something large. She held it in her mouth in such a way that it stuck out on both sides. I jumped up to make her let go of this poor mouse when…..suddenly I realized it had, like, 4” long antennae. Wiggling away at the tip of its palm-length disgusting body.

Anyway idk what she did with it after that bc I screamed bloody murder, kinda blacked out, and got the fuck outta there. I’m not even scared of bugs, in general…..but downtown LA certainly made me terrified of a few kinds 😂

An unjust enrichment claim against her has to show she was aware prior to the home being built on her property and did nothing to rectify it.  She also could be considered unjustly enriched if she is refusing to return the home (as much as the builder can get in materials without reducing the value of her lot at the time the home was built.)

They don't want to lose the money they put into building the house, she wants the house gone, presumably at the developers expense.

They are attempting to sue cuz they fucked up and are likely to lose big time.

Building costs + demolition costs = lots of lost money 💰

Switching lots = win on developers behalf + loss on the ladies behalf.

d239me,"It all depends on the people in the relationship. Sometimes she’ll want flowers every once in a while. She might not tell you but I can guarantee you if she’s feeling down and you haven’t bought her flowers in years, and you show up with them and tell her you love her, the gesture will be a million times more meaningful. It’s all about expectations. Just because she doesn’t expect you to get her flowers doesn’t mean she won’t appreciate them. My parents have been married for over 25 years and my dad still buys her flowers and chocolates. It doesn’t even have to be a holiday/anniversary. He goes on business trips and every time he goes he buys chocolates from that area. Last trip he went to Hawaii and brought her back chocolate covered pineapples and a Hawaiian dress. Now I’m not saying that’s required for every relationship because it absolutely isn’t. Not even in the slightest. But this I was raised to always know how to make a woman happy and treat her right. Even down to knowing her favorite songs so that you can play them for her. My dad taught me how to buy the right gifts too, how to know a woman’s style and what she likes. I can’t tell you how many times my dad has looked to me and said “son, watch this” and he turns up the radio and says “honey, do you know this song?” She’ll roll her eyes and he looks back at me and says “watch”. After a few seconds of her trying to ignore the music she throws her book to the ground and exclaims “oh I love this song I haven’t heard it in years!” And my dad will just laugh and say “yeah you used to listen to this all the time in highschool.” He knows her favorite music better than she does. Even down the the artist and sometimes album. My mother doesn’t even remember the artist sometimes. He always does. 

All these things sound small to us guys, but trust me they mean way more to her. Guys don’t really care all that much. “Oh it’s just some flowers” but she’s not thinking that. She doesn’t even care about the flowers. To her it means you were thinking of her. It means you wanted to show her you care. That’s why I call these gestures and not gifts. It’s not about the object you hand her, it’s about the meaning that object carries. The flowers are a messenger, so are the chocolates or that Hawaiian dress. 

Trust me, just cause you haven’t done it in years, doesn’t mean she doesn’t miss it. ❤️

Best of luck my friends,

Once a morning dove was trying to escape a hawks claws it fell out of the sky hit the side of my truck and I then almost ran it over!

eksfz9,"There’s an artificial lake near where I used to live that’s a popular winter attraction because all the trees that are slowly decomposing under the water are releasing gas that gets trapped in the ice. Really neat to see! 

However, because the lake has a hydro electric dam at the end, the water level is not constant and slowly drops over the winter. So people will drive their trucks out into the middle of the lake, drill a hole to do some ice fishing, and realize they are 30+ feet above the water with only the ice sheet supporting them. 😰

Idiots are everywhere.

ewyaxo,That’s mean but I wheezed. 😔,2020-02-01 16:43:45
ewyaxo,"I wish this was less common sadly...did Thanksgiving one year to give my mom a break. Make two hams (we're a ham family, not really Turkey so sorry not sorry). Confirm who is coming. Pretty much everyone says yes except nephew who works at a restaurant so I get it but he lets me know he'll pass by. 


Thanksgiving day arrives and...no one. No actually shows up 🤬 to top it off, I could've worked for overtime that say since no one wanted to work [because it IS THANKSGIVING]. Sister doesn't call until that night and says she was tired and not feeling well. My niece can't come by because her mom/my sis was her ride. Mom decided to work that day for overtime and made the decision the night before. Everyone else said they'd just pass by at night 6+ hours after the meal. 


I call everyone I know on my friends side if they wanted any food and only one friend says they can take something but it'll be next day because he's with the wife and her family. 


It's 10 hours after I made everything and started into my second bottle of sake which is sad given I don't drink, its a pricey bottle I was saving for a ""special occasion"" and it's been 7 yrs since my last drink and my nephew passes by as a surprise after work and says he's super hungry and I go ""oh well then!"" and is basically looking at tons of food being untouched. 


Since this is bringing back depressing memories, I end up  basically I try to package whatever I can into bento boxes and still no one wants to pass by and take it and getting the ""wtf would you cook 2 hams, that was kinda stupid"" reply despite the ungrateful fucks knowing I was cooking for 13 ungrateful mofos 😤


So about 1/3 ended up in the trash after all was said and done and that includes dropping 1/3 of everything to coworkers, dropping off food to 4 different family members and 2 to friends and trying to drop off as much on my nephew to take. Ended up giving him half a ham and telling him if he wants to feed it to his dog I kind of don't care because at least someone will be happy 🙄


Every year since then I never arrive ""on time"" for Thanksgiving and kind of don't care even if I show up late or without eating and leave after an hour. I do remember most of what I made and it was two hams, did a pot roast, garlic potatoes, cheddar and bacon baked potatoes, scallops wiith bacon, carmelized carrots and green beans, glazed salmon, fruit dishes and bacon filet mignon and BBQ ribs. I used to cook heavily over a decade ago prior to this but was always working Thanksgiving so I typically settled into buying dishes and desserts. I think I went all out because it was the first time I landed 2 days before and day after Thanksgiving off and wanted to do something special and it just backfired spectacularly! 


I never cook for the holidays anymore and give weird looks whenever someone asks me why I don't cook for the holidays; I know some of my friends remember some of the stuff I used to make (all prior to this). I just give them funny looks and a slightly uncontrollable twitch in my eye. I'm sure I should see a psychiatrist over this as I'm sure I'm still holding onto grudges over this. 


I'd also add I visited 3 farmers markets to get as many fresh ingredients as possible and made a tons of trips with public transit getting around and shopping with local produces. And while one was only two blocks, them bags of potatoes hurt walking just 2 blocks my age! In a way I imagine that's as close the feeling of disappointment as I could get to feeling like I was getting stood up at the altar without going that route. 😖


In case anyone wonders, I just order the Cajun turkey from Popeyes and take that home and live with the satisfaction that the person sitting across from me on the train envies me just ever so slightly 🤤 also I gave me nephew a PS4 that Christmas too lol!

Edit: and thanks for the kind silver! I suppose sharing some pain has its rewards 😅",2020-02-01 07:37:19
ewyaxo,My husband does 85% of our cooking.  He also contributes an additional 25% in commentary (suggestions) when I cook.  My cooking isn't dreadful.  He just prefers his way.  😉,2020-02-01 03:58:35

ewyaxo,"I'm 100% certain why it's that long 😭 I just never really speak of it to the family and only give my mom the luxury of a free pass because I'm certain she had fears about loosing her job for not being a good employee and it's a hospital job that surprisingly gives her great healthcare but outside her and my nephew I get pretty salty about it.


Probably once I have a family might be different and do it agakn but ugh..that's a whole other affairs lol!",2020-02-01 08:33:58
ewyaxo,"I honestly should but I'm sure the biggest problem is cost and to be perfectly honest, I've been in therapy before and there's be ""other"" stuff they'd want to cover. Without getting too detailed, 2 family members passing away, surrogate father, a ""mom of sorts"" and then her son suing all in the span of 6 years...

I kind of want to be in a financially settled place before committing to this since I know it'll be a journey more so I never really finished therapy to begin with 🥺 

I know...great American healthcare for mental health...*heavy sigh*",2020-02-01 08:38:13

ewyaxo,"I just wanted to chime in and say that I *had* something similar.

It sounds a whole lot like my social anxiety when I was 16ish. It always happened when eating - I started shaking so bad I barely could hold a fork or a glass of water.

It sounds very similar to what you describe - I thought about if I would act or look weird and thought people would judge me (well, that‘s the gist of it anyway). That made me so anxious I my hands jittered so bad I once or twice spilled a glass of water, which obviously drew more attention to me, making it a lot worse.

.. and well, that‘s classic social anxiety. It affects everyone differently, but in general, it‘s the fear of being judged.

My then-girlfriend helped me to overcome my anxiety. The bad news is that the only way to fix any anxiety is by doing what makes you afraid - over and over and over and over. I only later in life got confirmation by a therapist that it indeed was social anxiety (which I already was pretty sure about, I used to read a lot about psychology) and he congratulated me about overcoming it by myself / with my SO which made me super happy.

Telling the ones you eat with also helped a lot. The good news is that I guarantee you guys aren‘t alone - and if I can do it, you can do it as well. It doesn‘t have to be permanent. Go and see a therapist if it actually prevents you from doing social activities. Life is so much easier if you‘re not holding yourself back - and way too short to not enjoy it.

I hope you can get rid of it as well. I believe in you and I wish you good luck! ❤️",2020-02-01 09:38:59

ej3moy,We had to say goodbye last week to the dog I loved more than any I have ever owned....and we’ve rescued many many over the years. Closer to a child than a pet this Border Collie could understand abstract concepts and hundreds of words... she lived to work and watch her horses. You could tell her the name of a horse and she would fetch him or her from the pasture. When she suddenly lost her back legs due to arthritis pressing on a spinal nerve we asked our wonderful vet who takes care of all our  horses cats and dogs to let her go here at the farm with her family all around. He made it as painless and kind for her and us as humanly possible. She is buried under her favorite tree so she can always be watching over the horses she loved. Skye was the GOAT. 💔 Shout out to Fayetteville Animal Hospital snd Dr Bryan,2020-01-03 01:48:16

ma4gni,"I don’t. I prefer low rise, canvas sneakers and they’re just more comfortable w/o socks.

EDIT: Downvotes for not wearing socks, wow, guess  a lot of you don’t live near the beach, or have foot odour, or other fungal/nail issues, or only buy shoes once every few years. 

Please don’t tell me you also wear socks with flip flops/slips, and sandals and/Birkenstocks! 😬

I don’t care either way, but no need to be rude about such an non-controversial opinion as sock preference. 

If it makes you feel better, I prefer wearing my canvas sneakers with white linen pants rolled up to shin height and button down shirts with rolled up sleeves. I happened to have a pony tail in the early-mid 90s but that’s neither here nor there, as I was really into grunge and punk as a teen and had hair down to my back like a young Anthony Kiedis. 

For those that suggested ankle and no-show socks politely, thank you, and I do have them. I use them when hiking or playing ball, but I use different shoes for those activities. 

I also wear warm wool socks in winter and when I go snowboarding, and I wear regular white socks when wearing jeans and a tee. 

My point is, a nice, light pair of canvas shoes needs no socks. Specially near a beach in the summer!🍸🍸",2021-03-21 20:08:40
ma4gni,"When I was a freshman in high school I played volleyball and it was the first serious volleyball I had played so I convinced my mom to get me volleyball shoes. I knew 100 dollar shoes were a reach because we didnt have much but my mom got them anyway and I was determined to put them to good use so I wore them during try outs and long story short, my two big toe nails died from the pressure of the tip of the shoes hitting them and they came off weeks later.

The pain lasted for a couple days but after it was just a numb, hollow feeling. I remember tugging on the nail and it just coming off and being so paranoid my mom would kill me 😅😅😅

I'm 26 now and tbh don't really know better because two years ago, at a music festival, I wore platform shoes that were a little small because they were cute and my two toe nails died again lol",2021-03-22 08:27:29

1cgdvf0,"While training a new warehouse worker on his first day after school and forklift certification, I told him to pick a pallet and check on the computer where it should go.
He picked the first pallet, that was quite high, so it should go to the highest position ten meters up, he lift it correctly, look at the cameras, place it correctly and start to back his forklift.... while starting to lower the forks before they are completely free. The effect of this, is that the ends of the forks, hit the beam under and point a little bit up. Enough to drag the pallet enough that it falls down. 
I take a breath, and say with a smile - great, now I can show you how to write an incident report.
The material on the pallet ? A single server computer, ready to just plug in and start up for the customer.
Cost ? About 150 000 dollars. 
That guy were so nervous that he called in sick that day after lunch, but came back later in the week.
I had a talk, and after that - water under the bridge.

I slammed ye old shit box into 2nd and when she upset the inertia on the truck ; I pit’d the truck hard and took the tire off and she rolled 4-5 times (ironically) into a Honda dealership and caused a 112$k in property damage and wrecked just over 304$k in hpd pilots, ridgelines and elements. My old Honda still bares the scar…. Of a cracked headlight lens and a rubber mark on the bumper. That bitch basically had her parents hand out $23k to me because they tried to drag me to court and say it was my fault 🤦 the dumb bitch went slandering me on TikTok and instagram ( showed my id and address from insurance) Took that money happily from the oil rich entitled (now 19-20yo) TikTok “influencer” Bought a new ice shanty, set of rod&reels, set of winter tires, heart pills for mom, down payment for carpal tunnel surgery for dad. I invested 12k that account has almost quadrupled

Worked at a quick lube shop and the owner of said shop rested the door on a hitch of a pickup truck that was in for a 1hr+ long service (his reasoning was it was northern Canadian winter and the truck was hanging just a wee bit too far back to close the door all the way so he pulled it down as far as he could). He swore up and down that he told me he did so, but I 1000% do not recall he doing so and I have crippling anxiety so I tend to remember things like that. 

Well, the service was done, cashed the customer out, opened the exit door and the truck started to pull out and took the entrance door with him. No damage to the truck and the customer was laughing (thankfully) but the look on my boss's face through the office window.. 🫠 thank God I had a special place in his heart (and I'm a girl so I was able to abuse my eyelash fluttering 😅) and I just walked up and gave him a great big hug and said, ""Please don't fire me"".

We were supposed to kick off their lil visit by greeting them at the entrance, me holding a tray of red wine, my coworker a tray of white. We had done this forever, I’ve carried ridiculous amounts of glasses on trays swooping through crowds and never had an issue. 6 glasses? Standing still?? Easy peasy! …except they were running a lil late.. and I don’t know what happened honestly, just all of a sudden my hand went spastic and I dumped the whole tray of glasses all over the grand piano I was next to.

peroxide actually doesn't do anything helpful when used on a wound! (i mean I've heard people say it's good for cleaning blood??? I've never tested...) but it's actually only ever been shown to kill bacteria and viruses in high concentrations, and only in a lab! never in a human body. 

peroxide actually gained it's place in your grandma's medicine cabinet because it used to be advertised as basically *water*, but ***better!*** thanks to having an extra hydrogen molecule, and... being fresher and cleaner than water itself, because of it?? 🤷‍♂️",2019-12-31 07:59:37

if you really worried about it, you're better off going with something tested, rather than a random remedy. good news though, is that folk remedies usually ""work"" because the problem just goes away eventually",2019-12-31 07:54:10

svpwq8,"My ex wife and her friend were both married. My wife was cheating on me and her friend on her husband with these two twin sisters who were single.

Edit: I’m probably being trolled at this point but hope this helps 😂

Edit 2: the twins aren’t hot they’re the somewhat feminine/manly type. So no, I wouldn’t have wanted a 3 some.

Edit 3: Morgan (my ex’s now gf) sent my wife this message. My ex wife is the blue message.

Edit 4: my best guess at what the text means.  Morgan is single. My ex was married. Morgan’s sister was single, my ex wife’s friend was married. I’m guessing they considered themselves couples at this point as single/married people since 2 were married 2 were single.

Edit 5: Apparently no matter how much I try to explain this I can’t. If someone who understands what I said can put it into simpler words message me and I’ll add it to this. Thank you 😂

ffhvek,"I was born with 5 congenital heart defects and 2 congenital lung defects.  And as I grew up I was diagnosed with asthma, copd, pulmonary hypertension , pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans... my left lung never worked over 15% and stopped working about 15 years ago... my 4th open heart surgery... part of the hope was to get more blood flow to the lung... at that time it was around 5%, and were hoping for about 10%... but it back fired and within 6 months we found it was down to like 2%... and soon after it was 0.  

Everyone is surprised I actually don’t have CF, my mom said they tested me more than once because even as a baby/toddler I had and still have many of the the symptoms.  

I’m in a 2nd round of heart/bilateral lung transplant evaluation now...

There was a plan to remove my left lung or even just a portion of it. And would fill the space with something like ping pong balls.  As a teenager I was disappointed when they said it was too high risk for me... because I thought being filled with ping pong balls would be cool as hell 😂😂😂 that would definitely be an X-ray that would go on the fridge 😂 I’m almost 30 now and I still think it would be cool.

ffhvek,"Lupus club in the house!

My doc told me not to worry too much, stress only makes it worse and messes with your immune system.

Told me to take my temp before leaving the house and before going to bed. No rise in temp? Don’t worry. Wash your hands, don’t bother with a mask. Don’t touch your face. For now, treat Corona just like you treat the flu. 
Yes, we’re high risk due to our disease but worrying won’t help us. If you’re feeling a bit sick, are coughing or sneezing then (if you can) take a day off. Don’t shake hands to greet people and just tell them that you’re immunocompromised. They’ll understand!

Her tips have helped me relax a bit. I might get the virus, but worst case scenario I’ll be hospitalised. I have survived the flu a bunch of times, even have it at the moment. Though, being hospitalised might be incredibly worrisome if you’re in a country that doesn’t have affordable health care :(

Id recommend this. Any “deterrent” only increases the time it would take to steal. If they want it, theyll get it… but this device is the best ive seen so far. 

Option 2) can be used in conjunction with 1. spray paint the entire thing bright orange/yellow/red in high visibility high temp spray paint along with etching your vin into the CC. This *could* help a salvage yard refuse to accept it and possibly get it returned to you if found. 

Option 3) the nuclear option. Get metal welding glue and affix 100 razor blades in differing angles along the CC and connecting pipes. Will cut the ever loving shit out of the thief when they get under there and try to saw it off/remove it from under the car 😈. They will definitely think twice once it sinks into their wrists while sawing.

You can find and ACTUAL NEST, get a bee keepers help to get the nest, and still attach it to the CC. No one I need their right mind you even try to go near it. Bald Face hornets are nasty and will not only sting you, this hurts like a son of a bitch . I've been stung by them.

Sure you did. 

Anyhow, any large, old organization, whether it’s General Electric or the State of Wyoming is going to have convoluted bureaucratic cruft, that out of context makes no sense.

You’ve gone and knee-jerked to the sensationalist visual equivalent of a libertarian soundbyte. After reading some background on the story it’s still dumb, but nowhere near as ridiculous as presented. ",2018-06-17 09:55:43

136i1cb,"Edit: for those of you who have not experienced anything like this before, I HIGHLY recommend doing “walkthrough videos” of your home/apartment every 3-6 months (3 mos if you buy things often, 6 mos if you do not buy things often). Go slowly, and show every aspect of every room. Zoom in on gaming consoles, controllers, TVs, computers, etc. This will help so much if you do eventually have any damage to your home. 

Hi OP! So this (the ceiling thing) just happened to me in December, and I want to impart some hopefully helpful words:

First, it’s very easy to be devastated/overwhelmed in the first few days. Feel those feelings - they’re totally valid, and trying to pretend everything is fine ultimately just makes it worse (at least in my experience lol). While this will all hopefully be replaceable, it currently has been destroyed, and that is understandable very upsetting. 

Secondly, hopefully your insurance company will be able to step in and fix all of this at little to no cost to you. It may take time, but keep your head up, stay on the company about getting things taken care of. You pay into them, and they need to pay out when it’s time. 

Third: Document EVERYTHING. Do not throw a single thing away before taking a picture or video of it. I’m talking ceiling material, insulation, any pipe pieces that fell (or any that will be removed by a plumber when they come to fix it… the insurance company will likely want to see the pipe to figure out how/why it burst… if that’s what caused this). 

3A - it is likely that the damage was not just in that room… video all rooms that you think may have been affected as well. For us, water ran out of that main room and then poured into most of the rest of the house, and we ended up having to have ALL of our floors replaced, in the entire house. 

Fourth: when going through your items, ESPECIALLY your books, I recommend taking pictures of every books front cover, back cover, and inside pages with publishing info. When you’re done, start researching the specific books (plus the publishing/printing info!) on eBay/something similar, and make sure you find EXACT matches! We ended up having about 10 books that would cost between $100-$250 EACH to replace, and I wouldn’t have known that if I didn’t check to make sure the publishing/printing info match. 

That’s all I can think of currently, but I hope it’s helpful. Also feel free to reach out at any time with questions, and I’ll help how I can! (DMs are better than chat requests cause I never check chat… lol)

Good luck!!!! It feels impossible now, but things will eventually get better ❤️",2023-05-03 14:56:26

It’s hard to believe such dramatic bad luck can happen in such a short timeframe but sometimes that’s how it goes. 
Last year, my dad had an unplanned severe open heart surgery, quadruple bypass…& then his 1st week home, our 10yo American Akita died unexpectedly. He was healthy, just was at the vet a month before. He died of bloat. I know it’s not the same. Just sometimes bad shit stacks up on each other relentlessly...I hope some positives come your way asap my dude.

One guy who just happened to be in office that day looked through the fridge and took all of the food he found. 

Boss goes to get his lunch and spots coworker eating his apple. He asks where did he get it from. Dude says “it was just in the fridge.” Boss asks “and who do you think brought that, knowing that it wasn’t you.” Dude goes “I just saw food in there and didn’t know whose it was so I just ate it.”

We used to love sitting on the porch and handing out candy.  Once our kids started getting into the trick or treating age we started just putting the candy out in a big bowl as we were gone for the night.  Never really paid attention to it until we got cameras installed.

The very first year with our cameras up as soon as we left the house an old bag with two teenagers drove up and proceeded take everything…Bowl and all.  Literally had a parade of kids go up to our door all night long and knock because we’d left our light on obviously and every single one leave dejected because nobody answered.

I called the customer multiple times with no answer then called support. They couldn’t get ahold of the customer either after multiple attempts then TOLD ME TO LEAVE IT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TAKE A PICTURE FOR THE CUSTOMER! Wtf? 😂. Another time a dude down rated me because I dropped his order at the address and he called me after screaming at me about how I didn’t leave it at the right place. I said “I’m so sorry is your address XXXX?”
He said “yes but I’m at work and I forgot to change the delivery address to my work”. 
Ok, I would be more than happy to run it to his work for him because mix ups happen but his work was 45 mins away from his house! Turns out other drivers I knew had this guy before and it was a repeat thing he did because his favorite restaurant was waaaaay outside of that delivery zone so he tried faulting US because he wanted to scam. 🤦‍♀️ I happily called support then gave the food to a homeless guy down the street.",2024-04-09 21:41:41

Truthfully, I use those services about once a week 🤦‍♀️ I don’t usually bother meeting the delivery person at the door; but the times that I have seen them, it’s more often been a man than a woman. I’d say the split is about 70/30 (in my experience). 

Fortunately, I’ve only been outright scammed one time. In my experience, the worst parts of it are when the restaurant messes up the order, or a grocery item is out of stock and the shopper replaces it with a “comparable” item without asking.",2024-04-06 21:36:11

1bxki2d,"For the most part, we as a generation realized how shitty it is to mock people for their profession. So most people don't do things like make fun of fast food employees anymore, because it's not socially acceptable. But the douchiest among us still need to look down on others to feel better about themselves. So now gig workers are filling that need. It's honestly really gross. 

I have worked for these apps. I have a graduate degree and a full time job. I started during COVID when I was furloughed, and kept doing it part time because it was kind of fun and could be profitable if you were picky with orders. I don't do it anymore because the orders dried up since people are comfortable being in public again. And I've met all sorts of people who do it for all sorts of reasons. Single moms who can't afford childcare, retirees who are just trying to keep busy, college students, people who just need a little extra money to save for a vacation, etc. Even most of the people who are doing it as a main gig aren't ""stoner criminal losers who can't hold down a real job"", it's people who don't *like* having a ""real job"" because they have more freedom this way. People only look down on them because it's low paying. No one says about freelance writers or web devs ""oh I bet they can't get a real job"" 🙄

It's absurd to me how people glom on to a post of one person doing something ""bad"" and making negative character assessments of thousands of completely unrelated individuals in a similar situation. How in the world is that remotely logical?",2024-04-07 13:59:54

1ax6kfc,This is exactly how I found out I have it. 💀 I thought it was part of the sound of silence.,2024-02-22 17:36:40
1ax6kfc,"Yikes. Found a link of different sounds of tinnitus. The first one was already what i hear. Yikes 😬

1ax6kfc,"I went to a TON of concerts as a kid and hurt my hearing. The first one where I KNEW I screwed up, I was 15 and saw Ministy, Foetus, and Young Gods.

That night, I took a shower after the show. It was a high-pressure shower that was LOUD. I couldn’t hear it.

I rowed crew, as a sport. I had a race the next day. I couldn’t hear the coxswain’s calls, so I had the guy in the seat behind me smack me in different places to tell me what we were doing…

That was a LOUD show…wish it was a little less so, 30 years later. 🤷",2024-02-22 18:54:52
1ax6kfc,"I am so sorry! 
Many years ago now, I thought I’d go crazy when I developed tinnitus (within Ménière’s), overnight. Frankly I thought I was going crazy for a short while. This was pre internet & lack of information was scary.
All I can say is deep dive into patience.
Moral of the story,it’s 50 years later, still ringing, more consistent than most of life, and, 
it’s survivable. 🌞",2024-02-22 19:25:00
1ax6kfc,I don't think I've ever heard complete silence in my life (as far as I can remember). I don't even know how it should be like not can I even imagine it in my head 😂,2024-02-22 20:29:50
1ax6kfc,"Welp, today I realized that I've got tinnitus. I thought that everybody heard ringing in their ears when it's quiet 😦",2024-02-22 20:59:20
1ax6kfc,Nah thats just balanced ventilation in my house 💨,2024-02-22 21:57:01
1ax6kfc,"Reading all of this, I get the feeling I might have tinnitus... that... um... kinda sucks 😅",2024-02-22 23:28:48
1ax6kfc,I have tinnitus too. I miss silence tho 🥲,2024-02-22 14:15:39
1ax6kfc,"In high school we had to write a creative essay about silence. I wrote about how it starts of quiet and slowly builds to a roar.

I got a B and the teacher told me to go see a doctor 🤣",2024-02-22 17:40:43
1ax6kfc,I try to imagine it and it just makes the ringing worse. 😂 At this point my “silence” is forgetting about it for a bit.,2024-02-22 20:01:20
1ax6kfc,I wish this did anything for me 😞,2024-02-23 03:59:50
1ax6kfc,Welcome to the club 😎,2024-02-22 14:16:00
1ax6kfc,Im sorry 😭 You have tinnitus btw,2024-02-22 18:15:42
1ax6kfc,Yes 😂,2024-02-22 17:44:17
1ax6kfc,I am sorry 😭,2024-02-22 15:37:14
1ax6kfc,Sick of greenwashing? 😏,2024-02-22 14:14:03
1ax6kfc,No 🥲,2024-02-22 18:09:49
1ax6kfc,I heard silence before so 🥲,2024-02-22 19:00:05
1ax6kfc,I have a childhood memory of waking up on the second floor of Grandma's house to sunlight streaming in the window and the intermittent sounds of doves cooing outside. That is the memory of silence I hold onto because nothing is silent anymore. 😭,2024-02-22 19:16:16
1ax6kfc,"I have Ménière's and have had tinnitus for as long as I can remember. I've heard about the tapping your fingers against the back of your head thing but I've never had it explained to me that you need to cup your ears as well. I tried it and for a brief few seconds my tinnitus was almost inperceivable. I wish I could experience this all the time. Thank you for linking that video. 🥹


Take care of your hearing, y'all.",2024-02-22 17:01:15
1ax6kfc,"Had to try it, but it didn't work. 

I'm so curious how actual silence sounds, lol 😅",2024-02-22 19:47:02
1ax6kfc,Right?! I started tapping my left index finger and it was just a popping noise over and over again. 😂,2024-02-22 17:00:11
1ax6kfc,"Doesn't actually make me feel better knowing that there are many, many people suffering alongside me. 😆",2024-02-22 17:01:47
1ax6kfc,"bro... 🙏
Youd see static in a dark room, that is some next level stuff. Id rip my eyes out atp",2024-02-22 17:29:23
1ax6kfc,Hell yeah 😎,2024-02-22 15:13:16
1ax6kfc,I had acoustic trauma trust me i have tinnitus 😂,2024-02-23 19:49:53
1ax6kfc,"This is what helped me. I was so freaked out when I realized I had it, so it’s all I focused on. Understanding that it doesn’t have to be debilitating is helpful. It eased my anxiety about it which was making the ringing worse lol. When I’m really calm, the ringing is low and my brain actually tunes it out. When I’m stressed or anxious, my CNS turns up the volume. Its actually forced me to practice relaxation which has been great for my overall health 🧘‍♂️",2024-02-22 22:11:42
1ax6kfc,🤔 now you’ve got me worried about that noise and I haven’t even heard it,2024-02-23 05:03:16
1ax6kfc,Wait a minute 🤔🤔🤔,2024-02-22 19:02:39
1ax6kfc,Fr imax movies feel more damaging to my ears in the moment than loud concerts do. Hyped for my imax tickets next week though 🤣,2024-02-22 15:51:49
1ax6kfc,"Ahh yeah, same here on the dumbness... loud music in my car, plus I used to work in the engine room of a ship and didn't always put on my ear protection. 🤦‍♀️",2024-02-22 21:18:18
