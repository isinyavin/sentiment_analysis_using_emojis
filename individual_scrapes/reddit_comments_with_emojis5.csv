hbrimd,"I have 5 congenital heart defects.  2 congenital lung defects.  Copd.  Pulmonary hypertension.  Pulmonary fibrosis .  Asthma.  One working lung.  Bronchiolitis obliterans.  Heart failure.  Cardiomyopathy.  Autoimmune issues.  Immune system disorder.  RA.  Tmj.  I’ve had around 25 surgeries, with my 1st being open heart surgery when I was about 10 hours old. I’ve had 2 strokes and a heart attack. 

I’m turning 30 in July.

I don’t remember how old I was when this started.. but around 15/16 years old I think... my family and I had a joke that when “comparing” peoples health problems... I’m usually the one that’s gone through so much more than most. Even people who are 70+ years old...

So we say “I win!” 

And not because I’m a “one upper”... but because I won the health lottery that no one wants.  

I laugh/joke about my health a lot. And some people are taken a back from that...

I also joke that whenever I see my drs for a visit or in the hospital.. roughly half the time my drs are with interns/residents... and I call it my Greys Anatomy moment 😂😂😂",2020-06-19 03:38:06

hbrimd,"I remember my high school buddy with a hare lip and a cleft palate. Back then, corrective surgery was expensive and exclusive to well-developed countries, and he had neither, so he had this speech impediment where you can barely understand a thing he says because it comes out his nasal passages. He had this fucking hilarious shit where he sneaks up behind our friends and shouts ""Guess who"", and every time he does that, we're like, ""dude, you're the only one with a speech impediment like that"", and I totally lose it 🤣",2020-09-19 16:05:52

hbrimd,"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 hilarious! 

Btw... if I did die right now... I still lived decades longer than my drs thought I would.  But I would be upset that I died before turning 30.  That I didn’t get to experience that... but to be honest my life hasn’t changed much since I was about 15.  Can’t work.  Never learned how to drive.  Still living with my mom.  

But again... this is funny!",2020-06-19 04:28:15
hbrimd,"It’ll have to be your heart and both lungs.  In evaluation for transplant now... last week I was told that Northwestern/Children’s in Chicago has talked about my case a lot... with their skills and my willingness to be the 1st heart/bilateral lung transplant... I’m finally with the team I feel like I belong with.  

I was denied with Cleveland Clinic because it’s out of state ... you’d like knowing that not many hospitals in the US do both at the same ... that this would be deemed as a special case... but nope.  I was at Loyola for a little awhile but I didn’t like it there.  Always felt like an after thought and getting answers was hard. 

I have to have all 3 at once because theirs literally nothing for them to connect veins/arteries etc too...

We’ve know this was coming for a long time... but still scary as hell.  But I can’t wait to have new heart/lungs in order to know what breathing should feel like.  Wasn’t born with that gift.  It’s always been work.  

Till then I’m hoping so much my drs can find a way for me to get a portable oxygen concentrator ... been wanting one for at least a year now.  We have proof my breathing sucks.  My oxygen levels can drop as low as the high 70’s.  I spend a good 90% of the time in bed be doing anything else is hard... but I don’t qualify 😑 I’ve been looking to find a foundation/charity that could possibly help me... but I’ve been declined each time. I was thinking about trying gofundme again, last fall it stalled at about $500 so i stopped and returned the money... but o don’t feel right in doing that again given the current situations.",2020-06-19 04:25:23
hbrimd,My drs wonder the same thing. 😂,2020-06-19 13:28:01
hbrimd,"I am so sorry to hear this. 

When all of this 1st started and people complaining about not being able to leave their house... I greatly explained something.  And it’s exactly what your going through right now.  That staying home for a few months or more is nothing compared to a life time of lung issues.  I get that people lost their jobs over this... but when a person has lung issues... everything becomes hard.  So working after this can be a big challenge.  Staying home for awhile is worth it.  
And yet people still told me it’s unconstitutional to keep people home and wear masks.  😑😑😑

As for long term issues... sadly yes. While I can’t say for sure because you have it due to COVID-19 ... I’d still guess it’ll be life long.  

After more rules are lifted... I’d definitely look into going to pulmonary rehab.  You basically learn how to breathe in a more efficient way and try to build up your breathing. This past fall/winter I went twice a week but given that my situation is different from what they normally work with... I can’t see the results that many get after being in rehab for awhile.  But for you... I’d imagine it’s worth a shot.  I actually won’t be surprised if more and more people who are like you that they will be working with a lot COVID-19 past patients.  

You’ll probably have pulmonary function tests done, if you haven’t already... and pulmonary stress test.. 6 minute walk test.  To get a better gauge on your lung function and to track it.  

While we aren’t for sure this is the reason... I’m often in some pain while breathing, in my back rib cages. Heating pad helps a good amount. 

Also while sleeping if you aren’t already, sleep elevated. I have a 14 inch inclined wedged pillow. 

If you have any other questions please feel free to ask!",2020-06-19 04:54:08

hbrimd,"I’ll admit I watch a lot of tv.  But In the last few years I’ve gotten into Documentaries on Netflix.  Especially NOVA PBS.  And I’ll find documentaries on YouTube.  

I do read off and on.  Actually thinking about rereading Harry Potter since it’s been about 6 years since I’ve read them.  

But last spring I started to learn how to knit ! It was hard at 1st. I got frustrated to the point I stabbed my knitting needle into my bed once 😂 but once I tried a certain way to knit and major thanks to people on YouTube... I picked it up! I found a great yarn at Micheals that’s under $3 and I almost always get it on sale/coupon code.  So I’ve found ways to knit on the cheap. Because damn... some yarn is expensive and cheap yarn sucks. But Woollike in Loops and Thread brand is perfect!

Ever since I was little I wanted to be a chef.  Instead of watching cartoons, I’d watch Food Network.  This was before it was everywhere l. So I could only watch it when we were staying at Ronald McDonald House in Chicago.. which was often. I love to cook so much. I love the entire process, but sadly I don’t even have the energy to cook like I used to.  Even with a stool I have for me in the kitchen.  But when I’m having a good day... I definitely try to cook at least one meal.",2020-06-19 12:28:38

i8pq5h,"Fun fact: some insulin’s ARE over the counter. Human insulins, also known as Walmart insulin, can be purchased over the counter at Walmart. Why don’t diabetics use these insulins if they’re OTC and around $25/vial instead of the usual $274 (without insurance)? Boy am I glad you asked. The fact is that these insulins are very different from the insulins that most diabetics use today, which are analogue insulins. Human insulin is a much more unpredictable insulin, peaking at entirely different times than analogue insulins. There’s also the issue of these insulins leading to what’s known as “dead in bed” syndrome, where young, otherwise healthy individuals would die in their beds from sudden and severe hypoglycemic episodes.

ewe3tu,"My dog just recently died at 15 years old, and I'm that upset that I'm numb. I can't even cry. I feel like TIL is hammering on my floodgates trying to get in. You can't get in guys, you can't get in, I'm calling the detachfrommyselfithurts police!

&#x200B;

EDIT: The comment below made them get wet but I'm reinforcing the door and leaving the thread so that everything will be fine ™

EDIT 2: Everyone who has replied to me, with their stories of their own best friends who are gone (or who you are scared of going), their condolences, the song recommendations and the beautiful poems-one of which was written by u/DynamicSploosh, which perfectly described loss, I've been offered by someone very kind (who I won't username mention up here because I don't want to put pressure on them)-that they will draw Pippin for me-I want you all to know I am deeply touched.

&#x200B;

The world can feel so lonely sometimes, and I have spent the days underneath a blanket of complete numbness, emotional white noise. I was the same after my boyfriend died, and I spent months and months alternating between feeling as though I were on fire and feeling nothing at all, which is own kind of awful. Reaching out to people in the physical world feels, at times, like trying to touch those behind a veil, and this interaction online might not be seen as the healthy way to cope but breaking the complete non-interaction with people, physically or online is something that I know will help me get back to myself and the world.

I first started interacting with the world again in tiny, baby steps after my boyfriend died. I even felt scared of writing online, and my first hurdle was a comment on a youtube video (Fargo-the long road home). Sometimes, just seeing that humans are there, and they are human like you is enough to start melting the ice.

I'd never tell anyone in real life these things, because I know that my level of functioning back then was so far below the lowest bar they were thinking of. I'm not saying I'm a tortured soul or whatever, though I know what I've written here sounds pretentious. I think it's just so difficult for people to admit how low you can get, because they feel ashamed. Even though these issues are meant to be easier to talk about now, I think we all carry within ourselves experiences where we got down to a subterranean level of functioning. And we bury it deep.

&#x200B;

This response has honestly made me feel less alone. It's healthier to have real life people who make you feel that, I understand, but sometimes you're just too deep to reach. Interactions like this acted as a ladder for me in the past, and for anyone grieving who reads this-I hope you know that you're not alone. Even if you don't have any friends/family, the empathy of others is a living thing in and of itself. The people who wrote these heartfelt responses are out there in the real world and although you may not be near them, I hope that knowing they exist within the same time as you will maybe help you.

&#x200B;

I use a lot of run-on sentences and commas, sorry for that :( I know this edit is very rambling and might sound pretentious/preachy,but if someone who feels like they're frozen/on fire, who feels not human reads this and takes comfort then I don't care,

In short, you can say a lot of bad shit about Reddit but sometimes humanity shines through all of the bullshit, as in this thread.

Thank you for a very human experience guys.",2020-01-30 23:21:35

The information stored there is lost.

I mean, you literally said that anything ""written in stone"" isn't permanent. Written in stone. 

Technology changes rapidly. No one will be recovering all the info on floppy disks or cd's in the future. Technology will move on, improve, and all the old interface devices will be obsolete. Not many people own a faraday cage. 

If you need a ""middle man"" to decipher the data, it is vulnerable. Data isn't data anymore if it can,t be recovered and used.

Edit: i think you must be pretty young. I'm 50, and I've seen data recovery devices change so much over the decades, it's easier to see the issue. 2000 years from now the world will look *very* different than it does today. We don't live in ancient Egypt. 😉",2020-01-31 15:52:34

Nobody has the right to that information but you. Not only that; in many library systems, once you return a book, we don’t have a way of knowing you ever took that out.

lbwbqs,"You are right, 44 year old Jefferson likely initiated his relationship with Sally Hemmings when she was 15. As a 15 year old slave, she could definitely give consent and not be statutorily raped. She could definitely be the one pursuing the relationship. Makes total sense. Im going to ask you the same question that I asked another user: Can a 15 year old slave consent? Male, female, doesnt matter. Slave master is an adult. They are 15 years old and a slave under them, can they give consent? What is rape if not sex without consent? How is the term rape here unqualified?

Think back to when you were 15. You are 15 years old and a slave of Jefferson, he wants your booty, you can clearly and obviously give consent right? Its not like he has your family and you in bondage and can more or less do literally anything to you as a reprisal for fighting back or disagreeing with the concept of losing your virginity.

His sons were still enslaved until his death. This is a person who in the public championed for the end of slavery but straight up didnt release any from bondage except 2. A guy who was in ownership of over 600 slaves and only freed 7, 5 on his death bed, 2 while alive.

Right, small consolation to slaves anywhere, your owner is in debt, its not their fault even if they continually champion and campaign for the end of slavery elsewhere. Their hands are tied here. You need to consider their financial situation before thinking of something as silly as ""freedom"". This is obviously two faced. Jefferson wasnt an idiot, he had to have known and struggled with reconciliation of his own slave holdings and his work publicly in civics.

Again, he pushed to end slavery but he was neck deep in the worst aspects himself. Breaking up families, owning hundreds of slaves, raping his slave and enslaving his own sons that came of it. But yeah, cant forget the context that he had debt, his slaves were treated well, etc. Gloss over the fact that he went through hundreds of slaves and the other negatives. Think about poor old Jefferson and his debts. Why he probably had it worse than any slave 🙃 that poor fella",2021-02-04 18:12:11

hiqvu8,"As a cancer survivor (germ cell tumor) r/cancer had a post that perfectly describes what it's like dealing with cancer and treatment


What’s it like to go through cancer treatment? It’s something like this: One day, you’re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE’S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE. Wait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST!

So you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they’re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - “GET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU” - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whoever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he’s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it also punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying, “Can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead. Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say, “That was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!”

Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “Boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “Fuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.😳”

hiqvu8,"Maybe it's different when you're the patient with cancer, and I can understand how a lot of you see it. It's definitely important to own your story and do or say what gives you strength... But for me, my 15 month old baby had cancer and I absolutely looked at it as a fight. It gave me the focus to keep my head above water. We had to do scary stuff but we were fighting the bad stuff in him by going through all the chemo and proton therapy and all the stuff. I felt stronger because I had to for him. And he's 10 now and super healthy and I absolutely tell him his story and let him be proud that he survived a crazy thing. He was a tiny warrior to get through all that and most of the time he was able to do it with a smile and a happy innocent heart. We connected with many families during that time and helped many who were brand new and still in shock from their diagnoses. There are many ways to be a warrior. 💗💪",2020-06-30 21:55:50

ack7y4,If you’ve ever bonded with a bird you know how special and loyally intimate they can be. I rescued a lovebird who had been hit by a ceiling fan twice had a broken wing and lost an eye. Her mate had died. I nursed her to health she bonded with me and later my husband as well. I have fibromyalgia and she always knew and was concerned when I had pain. She’d wanted to sleep with me and when we’d say it’s time to go to bed she’d completely flatten out her little body on my hand so she could stay and snuggle to my chest. She was so sweet and endearing and smart. My husband was organizing some tools and separating washers in a multi cubby bin.. she watched him and proceeded to pick them up and...put them into the correct places. It was really her way of helping and being a part of our family. Really remarkable how close we were. No doubt in my entire being this was true love from her and we felt the same way. One thing for people to generally keep in mind if you decide to have a bird in your life is that it’s important for the bird to choose you. Even as a rescue it is their decision so have patience and kindness..it takes time but if your chosen 😉 the love is well worth it by many magnitudes. ,2019-01-04 22:57:23

I had two cats, a huge male and a male kitten. The huge male suddenly got sick we rushed him to the hospital and he dies. I was so distraught I wasn't thinking and the vet asked if we wanted to bury him in the pet cemetery on the premise, and we agreed.
I went home and the kitten was waiting expectantly at the door, when he sniffed the empty carrier he grew worried and meowed all over the house calling our older cat. This went on for about three days then suddenly the kitten disappeared. I called and searched and eventually found him in their cat room in a corner behind boxes, his head in the corner and his face pressed into his paws with his eyes closed. I grabbed him thinking something was wrong but he opened his eyes and just looked at me sad like and I took him downstairs and sat him on my lap and as soon sd I let go of him he ran right back upstairs. I noticed the next day he had stopped eating and drinking. I went with a can of tuna upstairs and found him in the same position as before and I picked him up and showed him the tuna, he took a tiny lick then went right back to his corner. The next day I went up to check on him and see if he'd eaten the tuna I left for him and I found him laying limp and almost dead. In fear I snatched him up and rushed him to our vet. The vet said he was grieving himself to death over the older cat being gone and that there was nothing wrong with him physically but he'd try something he heard worked on grieving animals and see if it worked and kept him for two nights feeding him via an IV and said if he didn't bounce back that he would die. Fortunately while he was at the vets I ran an adopted a little female so she was waiting when I brought him home and he at first looked sad entering tbe house but as soon as he saw the little female he bounced right back and now they're best buds. So animals do grieve and I wished I'd known that ahead of time and maybe I could have done what your family did.",2017-12-17 22:41:09

a31ce0,"Next is memory space. When we declare a variable in our code, like ""int x;"", this uses stack space. Stack space is the immediate memory which a program is laid out and uses. You code is in this stack space and your local variables are in this stack space. Skipping the explanation of how the stack works (that is another lesson), essentially it is a limited amount of memory that every program gets to themselves. The last time I really cared about it, I think the typical stack space given was 1 megabyte per app.

If you run out of stack space, Bad Things™ happen. Modern OS's, the app just crashes. Older OS's and some embedded OS's will allow more destructive things. So how do you deal with loading like a 10 megabyte bitmap that you want to manipulate? With a pointer to memory on the heap. ""The heap? "" you say ""What is it?"". It is memory the system has for everything to use as needed. Say your operating system takes up 10 megabytes, the drivers 2 megabytes, and you have a few programs running with just their stack space of 1 megabyte. So your system right now is using 15 megabytes of memory. But you have 32 megabytes total. That extra 17 megabytes is the heap (oversimplification, but appropriate for illustration purposes).

How do we use heap memory? Ask for it:

    /* declare a pointer for heap illustration */
    int* p;
    /* get some memory to use for this pointer. We only want enough to hold an int */
    p = malloc(sizeof (int));
    /* assign a value at the newly allocated memory address */
    *p = 6;
    /* Show the stuff */
    printf(""The value at memory address p=%p is %d\n"", p, *p);

Will output something like:

> The value at memory address p=8010FF02 is 6

For small values like a single int, it may not seem useful to use the heap for storage. However, in some cases, the heap memory can be passed between programs. Typical program stack space can not. Also, like stated before, this is how you would load large resources to be used into your application. Which takes us to our last bit, arrays and buffers

Jews today= literally reject Christ as a messiah today, there's no argument about that. 

What Jesus said 2000 years ago = those who say they are Jews,  may be so from a genetic standpoint but they are not Jews in their heart, that is Having had accepted the son as the savior, and therefore that makes them the synagogue of Satan, and children of the devil.

The fact is your people blaspheme the name of the most holy day in and day out, for 2000 years now. Your people wrote that the son og God is in hell and that his virgin mother was actually a hoe. Me pointing out what YOUR people wrote, and what my God preached, is not anti semitism. You guys are just anti Christian. 

You may as well call Jesus Christ an anti-semite. 


John 8:19 

John 8:37, in God's own words 

""I know you're the seed of Abraham but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you"" 

John 8:41-42, the Jews said to Jesus 

""But we were born of Abraham, we are God's children "" 

And Jesus said 

""If God were your father you would love me"" 
""You don't love me because you are of your father the devil,  and you will lie and murder like your father ""


I urge you to follow the father, which can only be done through the son.

Only exception being maybe Special Forces/Special Operations issued weapons, they get better shit than the regular military combat arms units. Even still, if you have enough money you can buy custom firearms that, with all accessories put on, cost as much as a brand new small car; shit that rivals what SF/Spec Ops guys use (minus the heavy weapon stuff since it's probably hard to buy a Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle as a civie 😂).",2020-07-30 20:07:14

But of course they’d rather make things up about the U.K. to make themselves feel better

jailing citizens for ""wrongthink"" on social media is also more in the US, as well as being shot and killed in your own home or garden and no one even being charged.. but yeah the UK is more like Orwells 1984 lmao

“There were 7 men and 4 women with a mean age of 58.7 years (range: 20-77), 8 had significant comorbidities associated with poor outcomes (obesity: 2; solid cancer: 3; hematological cancer: 2; HIV-infection: 1).

At the time of treatment initiation, 10/11 had fever and received nasal oxygen therapy. Within 5 days, one patient died, two were transferred to the ICU. In one patient, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were discontinued after 4 days because of a prolongation of the QT interval from 405 ms before treatment to 460 and 470 ms under the combination. Mean through blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine was 678 ng/mL (range: 381-891) at days 3-7 after treatment initiation.

Repeated nasopharyngeal swabs in 10 patients (not done in the patient who died) using a qualitative PCR assay (nucleic acid extraction using Nuclisens Easy Mag®, Biomerieux and amplification with RealStar SARS CoV-2®, Altona), were still positive for SARS-CoV2 RNA in 8/10 patients (80%, 95% confidence interval: 49-94) at days 5 to 6 after treatment initiation.

These virologic results stand in contrast with those reported by Gautret et al. and cast doubts about the strong antiviral efficacy of this combination. Furthermore, in their report Gautret et al also reported one death and three transfers to the ICU among the 26 patients who received hydroxychloroquine, also underlining the poor clinical outcome with this combination.”",2020-04-10 00:45:43

aadb74,"I worked at a liquor store for two years. People are.. Dishearteningly unoriginal in their opinion forming. I'm not trying to sound smart here, I'm struggling to put it into words.

Branding is extremely powerful, as is suggesting to the consumer that they are in some way superior or sophisticated for using your product.

Wine and liquor snobs, in my opinion, are the Absolut™ worst offenders in the alcohol world. 

For wine, it appeared as if price tag was the basis for assessing quality more often than not, rather than challenging one's own opinions with comparisons across different price points within the varietals they enjoyed.

I heard of some people pranking their friends by swapping wines from different bottles and the unsuspecting participants gravitated to the ""expensive"" wines, naturally.

For liquor, not much difference. Lots of people only drink patron or cirac, grey goose, ect, without trying anything else.

I heavily suggest setting up blind taste tests with friends to broaden horizons when it comes to alcohol. You might find some 20$ bottles you prefer to that 80$ one. Or not.

>""Mister Rogers went onstage to accept the award—and there, in front of all the soap opera stars and talk show sinceratrons, in front of all the jutting man-tanned jaws and jutting saltwater bosoms, he made his small bow and said into the microphone, ""All of us have special ones who have loved us into being. Would you just take, along with me, ten seconds to think of the people who have helped you become who you are. Ten seconds of silence."" And then he lifted his wrist, looked at the audience, looked at his watch, and said, ""I'll watch the time."" There was, at first, a small whoop from the crowd, a giddy, strangled hiccup of laughter, as people realized that he wasn't kidding, that Mister Rogers was not some convenient eunuch, but rather a man, an authority figure who actually expected them to do what he asked. And so they did. One second, two seconds, three seconds—and now the jaws clenched, and the bosoms heaved, and the mascara ran, and the tears fell upon the beglittered gathering like rain leaking down a crystal chandelier. And Mister Rogers finally looked up from his watch and said softly, ""May God be with you"" to all his vanquished children.[26][80]""

You're not wrong  /u/Krimefail - it is partly based on Mr. David. But most of Larry's funniest experiences were used for Seinfeld plots. Larry met Mr. Rogers at the 1997 Emmy awards, and shared his concern he was running out of material. Mr Rogers then shared several anecdotes about times his attempts to befriend people went awry, which later became plotlines on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", such as the time an Eat N Park waitress insisted on charging him for having a singe pierogi from a friend's salad bar plate.",2018-12-10 23:51:56

Everybody else were making fake emails to get a couple of extra chances to win. But I discovered that I could just scroll back up the page and resubmit the request to share the competition endlessly. Meaning that I could exchange 1 fake email account for countless tickets to the lottery. 

Please note that this was back where we paid for internet by the kb, so my mom was always hovering over me when I was at the computer, and I usually had between 15-30 minutes of computer time a day.

One night, he and a rookie radio’d in for a break at the same time, and another deputy went to relieve my step dad first, since he had highest seniority. It took about 6 minutes for the deputy to come take over, and when he arrived, my step dad was unconscious on the floor outside a prisoners cell, and the inmates were calling for help. 

6(?) deputies worked to revive me step dad, and his heart started beating before the ambulance headed to the hospital.

He spent _11 days_ in an **induced coma on a respirator** and doctors weren’t sure if he was gonna make it or not; on the 12th day, doctors weaned him off the ventilator and he woke up!

He currently spends his day caring for his father, drinking beer, growing marijuana and making edibles out of his homemade weed butter lol (_its legal here, y’all_)

t6jmkq,"I dunno, that's going a bit far IMO, not actually calling it a ""science"". There are plenty of forensic science academics who perform solid studies in order to prove that their methods can statistically hold up. I do see where you're coming from, and I think part of that probably comes from the fact that, by the very nature of the subject, the types of prospective studies which would be considered ""gold standards"" in other fields just aren't really possible for the precise scenarios that forensic scientists on the field deal with. They do come awfully, awfully close, however, by utilizing cadaver models in tightly controlled environments as well as live animal models. Admittedly the statistics surrounding some of these studies can get a bit messy due to the difficulty in defining objective qualities of things like decay, and then further accurately quantifying such properties. But that's just the nature of the field, it's not their fault.

By saying that forensic scientists don't follow the scientific method, if you mean that they don't follow a very rigid model of something like, [and I'm reading this in something like a high-school-principal-with-a-stick-up-his-butt-voice 🤣) ""pose a hypothesis, and define a null hypothesis; do testing, and quantify results; perform a statistical analysis, and compare the *p* value to the *alpha* value; accept or reject the null hypothesis,"" then no, you'll find that much of it does not follow that model. But there are many different types of studies and ways to perform experiments that still follow the overall structure of the scientific method. Take organic chemistry synthesis research for example - you'll rarely find anything even closely reassembling the model that I just went through in their literature. It's rare to even see math beyond primary school-level in an organic chemistry journal. But that doesn't mean that their research isn't still rigorously ""scientific.""

I dunno, I'm not like attacking you or trying to start anything, honestly. It's just that coming from a medical background, it feels odd to say that forensics isn't a science or doesn't follow the scientific method. I think partly because saying that would also imply that fields like pathology or histology aren't sciences, either, which just isn't true. All I'm saying is that the scientific method isn't nearly as rigid in real world application as many people like to think and teach. Yes, having it strictly defined on paper is all well and good; but when it comes to actually putting it into action on the ground, many times what ends up being more important (and applicable) are the principles underlying the scientific method, and not so much the process itself.",2022-03-04 16:59:17

Something like, the first line of the test said, ""read all instructions before starting the test..."" and then, of course, the instructions to the test were super long. 

Naturally, I skimmed it, and then started the test. 

Damn was this test hard! Not fair. My teacher was a dick. 

Then the girl sitting across from me wrapped up, turned her test in, and left after, like, 5 minutes. Damn she's smart. 

Turns out, if you *actually* ""read **all** instructions before starting the test..."", there was a sentence at the end that said, ""now skip to the very last question, circle B, write your name on top and go home.""

He's gone to the extreme of googling info on people I couldn't give a shit about nor do I know or want to! I have never used this shit before either but since it's a massive part of my children's fathers life I thought I'd put my views across on how these ""stans"" are treating their partners.

 I've been screamed at several times and told I'm jealous over his carer choice.. LOL maybe if he put half the effort into our family that he put into figuring this campaign out he now wouldn't be single and living at MY DAD'S. Doesn't matter tho coz he has an internet connection😐 

I was diagnosed with ptsd after an 11 day stay on a mental assessment unit.. where he put me! The account that was messaging him had mentioned they had the same illness so it was shoved down my throat about Eminem having it😑 I was supposed to be released 2 days early but my partner said he wasn't ready lol 

Being away from my children has hurt me in a way that words could never describe. Then being told by my partner that he's not ready for me to be home after trying to commit suicide 2 weeks earlier made me feel fucking great as you can imagine! Then to come home to find several hundreds of messages to an account he didn't know on this shit while the whole duration of my stay in hospital I had very few messages from him at all again made me feel fucking great! His behaviour is erratic and he only ever cares when the next message is coming from an account he thought was em himself lol now it might be ed sheeran :/  yet I'm the one that was put on a mental health assessment unit lmfao 

The kids were packed off to my mum's for my duration in hospital so he could obviously spend time on this forum and messaging ""mm""... apparently he was sorting the house but I've come home to a shit tip that I've had to clean while he carries on messaging whoever the fuck it is! 

Iheartmindgames has now lost his family due to this bullshit and the rollout of this album. 
I'm being slated over another app because I'm publicly humiliating him and I couldn't give a shit. Maybe he'll realise how he threw his family away for something on the internet that isn't even real and maybe made the wrong choice when I gave him the ultimatum of us or the internet! 

I know it isn't anyone's fault but his own and I really hope the album does well.. although my ex thinks ems going to retire after this album coz ""he's worked it all out""

* Look at his denim jacket. No one in Texas wears a jacket like that. It's a denim jacket, but there's just something off about it. It's the style of jacket that doesn't fit.
* He's pretty much the only character in the entire movie whose jeans are made to fit boots.  All the born and bred Texans where standard Levi's, while Anton wears jeans that seem ""boot cut.""
* Also look at the type of dental. He is definitely not working class. His denim clothes are not faded or thread bare. It's like he's playing at being a cowboy, but he couldn't look any less like a cowboy.
* His dressy shirts mime casual collared shirts.  Too dressy for Texas casual.  It's just off somehow.
* His cowboy boots are too clean.  Clearly these boots have never seen a dusty road (this place into his taking his boots off).  Also, take a look at how angular they are, very sharp edges.  They are dark blood red, and I believe they are made out of shark skin.  They are boots that could literally kill you.

C'mon. Is it too much to hope that companies should be forward about the product they're making and take responsibility for what they put out? The entire packaging - from the vegetables, to the reduced fat notice, to the ""sensible"" brand name, to the product name, to the salt of the earth packaging - signals to a consumer that *this* is a healthy option. 

I shouldn't be expected to read through the ingredient list and have to Google each and every thing on each and every item i buy in order to make an informed decision. 

Some responsibility, yes, in fact, I believe consumers should actively take *a lot* of responsibility for what they put into their bodies.

asmvxc,"Yup! Very true! My last job wasn't anything special, it was a local convenience store behind my home and employed people from the surrounding (rough) area. There were about 16 employees in total (including management) and the team rocked (minus the store manager, a screaming banshee of a woman).

One of the supervisors broke her wrist and couldn't carry out her work tasks, so I was asked to step up into her role for a while (I have management experience from the past). This went on for a few months with no issues. But other staff members wanted me to become a full-time supervisor and made it known to the manager in case she was hiring for a supervisor. She said she wasn't.

Then, out of the blue, some stupid little spice boy turns up and we find out he is our new supervisor. He was useless, he wouldn't even handle deliveries because ""the boxes are dirty"". His attitude stank, he and I almost came to blows on a number of occasions, and I'm not a violent person.

I have health problems, but I could manage them OK with the job because it wasn't a difficult job to do. But he made it so. Other shit went down (not just with the new guy, but he caused a lot of problems for everyone) and I handed in my notice to everyone's surprise.

The following day, another colleague handed in hers. The following week, another. I left, and over the course of 2 months or so, all but 3 of the original staff members remained. Company management were brought in over the high turnover, the manager was removed from that shop and put elsewhere in the company. The trouble supervisor was let go. Company managers would come in often, so they knew all the staff because they chat away and stuff. 

Not long after this, I got a phone call from one of the company managers and asked if I could return as a supervisor (and actually get paid for it this time). I thanked them but declined based on stuff that went down in the shop.

Because the store manager had hired a very bad supervisor, she ruined work morale and ethic. She refused to listen to her 15 other staff members that he was causing problems for everyone and none of us wanted him there. When she lost pretty much her entire staff who had been there since the store was built, higher ups got involved and demoted her and fired him. But the damage was done for most of the staff there and we left.

I saw my old manager in the city center a few months ago, I burst out laughing that she spotted me and then tried to hide her face from me with a scarf. I was laughing because all I wanted to shout to her was ""bitch, I didn't like talking to you when I was working, why'd I want to talk to you now?"" 😂

EDIT: the new employee wasn't productive at all, but he was ""toxic"". The manager refused to admit she made a mistake. ",2019-02-20 12:18:04

asmvxc,"Thanks and I’m glad you found comfort! Sadly, it seems to be way more common than it should be :/ but I also didn’t know other ppl felt this way until a Reddit posts years ago where someone joked about this identical scenario(but not really) and so many others chimed in feeling the same. I honestly thought it was just “normal” or lazy old me just not wanting to work. But thinking back, fuck that noise, wishing for a car to veer off the road and hit me/hit the bus during my hour commute(too pussy then to actually walk in traffic) just so I didn’t have to put up with degrading shit(if I’m lucky..soul crushing was the norm) is so wrong.

That shit can leave lasting marks too. Not saying the ulcers/ what led to my Addison’s diagnosis(high stress causes flare ups😃) were because of it... but even leaving and finding a good job eventually, my body and mind fell apart, got sicker than I’ve ever been and eventually I had to move back to FL to work on it. Shits ALOT better now, but it’s messed up that I was lucky enough to have parents that could help me repair myself as best as I could and temporarily. 

I just felt like saying if anyone is starting to get these thoughts... do whatever you can to fix it NOW! They are toxic and pervasive and will leave you a shell of your former self if you are lucky :( lost too many friends to suicide and being there and navigating back was tremendously difficult since I went w the good ole Irish Catholic repression method prior to dealing with it. I know not everyone has the luxury of switching jobs, let alone access to mental healthcare.... but I’d recommend looking online for solutions if those thoughts start to occur. Yeah I get work sucks, but if you’re really starting to wish death upon yourself before EVERY shift.. be proactive by either looking for help, or if possible, speaking to your employer about grievances(which is prob not an option if you have these thoughts in the first place..) they might start as a “haha what if..?” lingering thing, but be mindful of it, that shit spirals fast! As someone who hasn’t been able to work in nearly 3 years, believe me I’d do anything to get back, but never again to a place that would treat a dog better than me, for Pay I can’t live on since they hired me w a verbal “promise” of a job I had a decade experience in and was actually liveable wage(comfortable even if busy) but first had to ‘train’ in a position I was more than overqualified for... should’ve read the writing on the wall when they fired the other guys from that spot since I could technically do the work of all 3, but for the same pay ofc... which didn’t even afford me 3 meals a day, forget social life. Thanks for letting me rant and hope if anyone else feels this way just know you’re not alone nor is it right!!!

How do you rehabilitate someone who accidentally missed a child support payment and is now incarced for 2 years because of someone elses fuck up? What about stuff that involves money and has nothing to do with harming another person such as tax evasion because they are trying to provide? Justice system is fucked and far too primal for the times we are in now. To be able to grow as humans is not being so arrogant and understanding the fact that theres no black and white anymore.

fh60pf,"At our old home we used to feed many wild visitors. Daytime, the usuals ; birds of many species, Squirrels and Chipmunks, up to 20, red and grays, wild Turkeys by the flock of 12-14 group, Ravens and Crows. So on. We’ve had both Red and Gray Foxes, and two Coyotes who were relocated by the Wildlife Officers, and at night, the Raccoons, and the Skunk families. They were so very cute! Mama and her babies! Once, we’d crossed path at night on our walkway. The Skunk just looked up and I looked at him and we both went our way. My heart sped up just a little but there wasn’t a need. Really is true that unless they feel the threat they do not squirt at you. No warning up tail, or the hissing. They are very adorable! 
Needless to say, I’ve got quite a bit of videos and photos. Loads! 🐿🦨🐇

What’s odd is that now we live in a rural town with 2.5 acres of woods, but only animals comes by are the two Opossums at night! Maybe we’ve yet become acclimated, it has just been since October- five months. 

The old place we were was a much busier location, a suburb, although the yard was surrounded by woods. Population difference ; 40k vs 8k max here. The area is surrounded by mountains, and hills, and river, and streams! Lots of still functioning farms, and the beautiful forests!  So maybe the animals are finding plenty of foods and don’t need to wander much for it. Which is Excellent! I am all for that. I hope it will not change the way it is now. No more human encroaching on the animals homes. They should always be considered when developing. The animals have the right to live and to flourish just as much as the humans. We need to  curve from the population explosion. Right Now! 

I am enjoying the birds who are visiting, eating their seeds I’ve set out. The red and gray squirrels taking away peanuts. We’d just received their 40#s of raw peanuts. This is the second shipment, in between the roasted in shell peanut snacks for humans bags. It’s a bit expensive but hey, we are enjoying their company so it is worth it. Every dollars spent on them. And since the opossums eat most of the leftovers, there are no wastes. Win-win situation. 

Thanks for reading.
Have a wonderful day today! 😊",2020-03-12 13:39:05

I once thought the same way until I started my own business. Now I know why the customer is never right and why businesses do everything they can to scrape up any pennies they can.

heyjcj,"Actually thats incorrect regarding her death. She had surgery and was recommended to spend several days in the hospital afterwards for pain management. Instead she opted to go home against medical advice.

She was cared for by Kanye's cousin at home that evening. The cousin gave Kanye's mom over 20 vicodins in the course of less than 24 hours, which was a major overdose (typically the prescription for this medication is 1 every 4-6 hours). The autopsy report declared she died from a cardiac arrest most likely brought on by respiratory depression and aspiration of vomit due to an overdose of pain medication. 

The doctor did their due diligence, the pt refused to comply and the cousin essentially killed her. But Kanye blamed the physician anyway 🤷‍♂️

I’m standing in line and a guy comes in carrying a boom box, he stood next to me. I thought it was weird that a middle aged dude brought a boom box to the DMV, until I heard NYC and plane crash. I asked him what was up, and he said a plane crashed into the WTC. This had happened before with a private plane, I figured the same. Then I hear the announcer get all flustered and something about a second tower being hit. Dude and I locked eyes and I said, “Doesn’t sound like an accident.”

Took care of my business, got in my car (I’d been listening to Stern) to hear dead silence on my radio and then Dan Rather comes on and says “Courage, everyone.” My blood ran cold and I screamed WHAT IS GOING ON??! Some woman hurried past my car and said “We are under attack! Go home!!”

jqkzd2,"I'm sure you don't have the brain space because you seem to lack the brain space to understand I'm not saying people SHOULD do it but its totally understandable to everyone (except your thick brain apparently) WHY people do.  I'm not advocating they should but it's not rocket science why they do.

You even agree its a dumb practice to get money but still don't understand why people try to get around it? Amazing.

NO ONE here is bashing shelters for being ""money hungry "" only saying people don't have the money but go off and rant. You're obviously too privileged to understand the concept of poverty and needing companionship. 

Even if the money is for a good cause some ppl just don't have it belive it or not my privileged friend.

And I'm glad you think your ONE and only experience speaks for every other shelter about the screening they do. You sure sound like a smart cookie no wonder they let you have a dog 🙃 lol

Obviously your experience must be universal despite the fact I've never heard of any shelter checking with a landlord before 🙄🤔",2020-11-09 05:07:05
jqkzd2,"Yeah its super inconsistent. I've had shelter dogs my whole life in Canada. Some are ridiculously strict and some literally don't care and just want your name address and money and you walk away with the dog.

 I've found MB to be super lax but BC much more strict, even excluding people who worked 6+ hours.

So yeah I think it really depends where you live and what shelter you go to.
But while I've heard of some that did house checks I've never had a single one ever do a background check so maybe thats a USA thing 🤷‍♀️",2020-11-09 04:52:04

Hillary should not even of been the nominee.

And no, Hillary nor Joe Biden are acceptable options. Plus, I am in the middle, more independent. I just call a spade a spade when I see it.

aisyuc,Nothing like a little p&p. 😂 ,2019-01-23 00:49:02
aisyuc,My family does this. Several of us have Crohn’s disease and the rest are regularly checked for cancer due to polyps. We’ve had 5 of us in at once before. The nurses were pretty amused since we were all sitting around in gowns making butt jokes across the ward. We go to the Cleveland Clinic to see a specialist and it’s a several hour drive. That’s nerve wracking after the prep but I’ve been doing them yearly for over a decade and no incidents so far 🤞🏻,2019-01-23 01:19:43
aisyuc,"Gotta say, as a CNA that used to care for people prepping for colonoscopies, this is a pretty bold move, Cotton.

Not trying to dissuade anyone from the scope, but basically you drink a salty mix, best to cut with Sprite. And then you shit your brains out. 

If you’re cool doing this in front of your bros, then knock yourself out. If you’re more private, then maybe shit your brains out privately.

Either way, get your guts checked because cancer is a bitch and early detection can buy you YEARS. 👍🏼",2019-01-23 01:21:37

aisyuc,"💯 don’t believe this. Unless you have an issue you should only need a colonoscopy every 10 years so they can’t really be doing it that regularly. One of them might have something that requires more frequent but depending on the issue it could be yearly, every 2 years, every 5 years so its highly unlikely that they’d all be on the same schedule.

Very inspiring, I've always had a huge urge to pass things down and make family traditions etc. Passing an object or a recipe or even a song! Down through the generations, makes me feel proud to be human.

13vowws,"This is an amazing story! The fact this song held so close to its originals for hundreds of years is why many religious books, including the Bible, were written as poetry. You add music to it and it’s much harder to change the story. The stories could be passed down sitting by the campfire, to younger generations with little loss of fidelity. I’m fascinated by the Gullah people and their ability to hold their society and unique language together. I can’t believe the women in Africa started singing along! Great story! Thank you for sharing. I have one of those Gullah baskets that I purchased in Charleston. 💕",2023-06-29 13:07:17

The article doesn't mention any locations. I don't hear enough interesting stuff about Georgia, and I think it's a really cool place! :-)

I'm guessing because you said Georgia, not Georgia, USA, that you definitely meant the country? But you know how the Internet is haha, lots of Americans assuming they're the only place that exists in the world, so I had to ask >.<",2023-05-30 14:45:14

Because who automatically assumes that the dirt poor former USSR country of Georgia had a rich history of West African slavery. One that can be seen in their current population today after they freed all their slaves. 🤡🥙

They always complain about someone saying they have an Irish grandmother or are German when they're American. In this instance, they can't flat out bitch about the descendants of the enslaved learning about their ancestry without looking like a fucking cunt so they're trying to be pedantic. 

This type of thing melts their brains given how much they freak their shit at anyone having any modicum of interest in their ancestry and are an American.",2023-05-30 15:14:46

I know I too take what I have for granted. I was just commenting to another person here that I was on the brink of homelessness in LA and I recognize the only reason I am not there in my car or on the street right now is because of a few people who cared about me. It’s a long story, but I ended up having to leave to live with my parents. I am very fortunate to be living here even though it’s not the healthiest environment.

7dem67,"I attended that show! (I’m 44 now, and moved from Buenos Aires to Madrid, Spain).

Is was awful. I was completely ashamed of what people did (always been a feminist and a lot into Riot Grrrl at the time, other than grunge). They behaved like barbarians, and I saw that the girls were pretty upset about the whole situation.

Dave Grohl was truly great and professional. Novoselik was ok, I guess. Not as pissed as Kurt. Kurt was clearly pissed and made no effort to hide it (I understood immediately what he was doing.)

All in all, the best part of that concert was the local band, “Los Brujos”. Curiously, they had a really nice song called “Kanishka” (here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NHGUvLBJBVg). A few months later, Nirvana released “In Utero”, with a really suspiciously similar song: “Very Ape”.

I got to know that band’s bass player (Lee Chi) later, and he told me they suspected they were somewhat plagiarized, but decided to do nothing about it.

Gosh! This was so long ago! 😝",2017-11-16 22:53:03

However, I honestly believe extreme fame/wealth/power really can fuck someone up that wouldn’t have been as fucked up otherwise. I think that’s why so many rich people and politicians get caught up in wild/horrific shit. You’re basically living a life with cheat codes. It’s going to get boring eventually and then you’re going to start looking for something new.

The best way I can think of to give a layman example is porn. When I first found porn, ANYTHING would get the job done. Over the years it’s gotten to where I’m watching stuff I never would have even contemplated being into. It’s not fake rape or struggle porn, but it’s also pretty fucking far from vanilla or what I used to find interesting.

And she worked for a radio station.
I got her upstairs, making out... I'm so ready I'm going to explode. I unzip just so I'm not hurting and I can have room.
I start kissing her all over... Working my way down.... And I lift her shirt up, see has this cute belly button ring ... And I'm kissing her chest and side and unbuttoning her jeans...
I get to kissing about 1-2 inches from her belly button...
And...I smell it. That nasty dirty piercing smell .. But... Along with something else.
It was her belly button itself.
Some sort of rotting flesh and the smell of sickness and stinking goop inside.

I got up...
Took a deep breath of fresh air...
And said, let's go.  I'm taking you back to the radio station.

Fuck it.
Can't deal with no stank belly button smell.

Hanssen then began to secretly videotape his sexual encounters and shared the videotapes with Hoschouer. Later, he hid a video camera in the bedroom that was connected via closed-circuit television line so that Hoschouer could observe the Hanssens from his guest bedroom.[68] He also explicitly described the sexual details of his marriage on Internet chat rooms, giving information sufficient for those who knew them to recognize the couple.”

He got into drugs, has gotten into trouble for trying to bribe his way out of trouble and has gotten in some trouble for drug trafficking. It’s really sad.

10yxihu,"I’m a nurse, I’ve worked swing shifts for years.  Once in my youth, I lived alone in a ground floor apartment with a cat.  It was my night off, but sleep was rare and sporadic and I had fallen asleep, fully clothed, while reading in the bedroom.  I heard a voice, that sounded so close it could have been from someone on the pillow next to me, it was a woman’s voice, very stern, who said “You need to get up, NOW!!”  

The last word seemed so loud it was almost like she was yelling right in my ear, so I shot out of the bed. It scared me, because I thought someone was in my room, but I immediately heard another noise at the door, someone was trying to break into my apartment.

I don’t know what it was.  A dream?  My subconscious trying to alert me to danger?  I dunno.

Edit to add:

Reddit MD has diagnosed me with Exploding Head Syndrome.  🤯 

And since this is a “cliffhanger”.  

I loudly announced while I called the police and the would-be burglar ran away.  The police came, looked around, didn’t see anyone.  There were no security cameras, so they took a report and left.  

There was some minimal damage to the exterior of the door, which the complex fixed.  Never heard anything else about it.  I think the would-be burglar probably lived in the complex and knew I usually worked nights.  They didn’t think I would be home.

And the voice was apparently Exploding Head Syndrome.  Multiple comments mentioned this, so I looked it up (I had never heard of it before).  The source I found said it could be associated with “Variable and broken sleep”, that certainly fits swing shift workers. It had never happened before, nor has it happened since.",2023-02-10 20:06:19
10yxihu,"This is sounds a little like what I experienced as a kid to me, to the point that my parents had me see a psychiatrist. When I was 12 and my parents were shit, I had what I recognise now to be my first near panic attack, and I heard a voice guiding me to ground myself before I even knew what that was. I always chocked it up to be pseudo-supernatural, because the voice always sounded like a guy from a recurring dream that I still have today. This voice showed up whenever I was reaching critical points and the loudest it came was just before I got pushed down and underneath the water by a friend when our raft capsized, when I was 18. It was yelling for me to kick off my friend, but I was really small sized and my friend was like 2* my size. When I was in my early 20s and in college I experimented with asking the voice for help, and with the help of some sleepless nights the voice showed up almost at will. Parents were elated my grades improved, not so much when they saw how exhausted I physically was even though I felt fine. They heard me asking for help once and begged me to visit a doctor.

So it turns out I’m schizophrenic. 🙁

Currently no longer need to be on medication, and I realise that I was probably slowly killing myself at one point to induce audio hallucinations. For the past few years I don’t really hear any voices when I’m awake, I still have the same dream of walking at a park and taking a seat beside the guy though.",2023-02-11 02:11:41

He loved it and Told my sister to read this poem at his funeral, My sister told him to cut it out with the death talk. They lived an hour away from us and When they'd come visit, It would usually only be my sister and her boys, BIL never came. For my mom's birthday (9/29) in 2001 he came to visit and Told my mom he was coming to see her one last time before he died. My mom told him to shut the hell up and quit with the death talk. 5 days later he was killed in a horrible vehicle accident with a Denver Mint Big Rig. He was burned beyond recognition so we weren't able to view his body for the funeral... We read the poem he wanted. After his funeral we bbqed & partied in his honor ❤️

 In May of 2003, One Saturday morning I was woken up by Mom around 4:45am to go sleep in her bed as she was going to work. I fell asleep. As I was sleeping I had a dream of my BIL. We were in a poorly lit room with a long table, He was on one side and I was on the other. He told me to wake up NOW! I told him that he was dead and This was a dream, He said to get up NOW because someone was coming for me. I said no, it's only a dream. He slammed his hand on the table, Called me a stupid little kid (He always called me that when he was alive. Term of endearment) and Said someone was coming around the corner to the backdoor and I needed to go lock the door. I woke up and went to the back door, It was unlocked. As soon as I locked it, Someone was trying to get in... He saved my life that day, The person who was trying to get in had been stalking me for 6 months and Was planning on raping me. My BIL has saved my life many more times after that. He's my guardian angel ❤️

Breeders are different in Europe too. As far as for german shepherds that is. They have facilities where they are cared for and given compressive vet care. And they are licensed to do so. If you have a federally licensed facility here in the States odds are it’s a puppy mill going off basic welfare requirements meant for lab animals. No ethical breeder here in the states keeps their dogs in cages the seize of a kitchen sink. Under USDA guidelines having your bitches whelp in your house is frowned upon. Or letting them run loose with you on a farm opens them up to disease. I prefer to have my dogs whether their retired or not, live with me and have a life outside of being living reproductive tracts. 

Animal welfare laws in the states are really messed up and need to be revised by people involved in the industries. Not Animal rights activists looking to abolish pet ownership. Not bleeding hearts who don’t understand animal husbandry. Not lobbists who stonewall and keep the outdated standards in place to legitimize puppy mills. ",2018-08-30 17:49:27

fmj32p,"In HTX gymnasium in Denmark here, so the kind of school you go to before you can go to university in your twenties. 

I usually have school from 8:10 till 15:10, some days it's only till 13:30 and some days I start at 10. I way prefer the days that start at 10, I'm usually much better rested and I have a better start to the day. It's more rushed because my bus if often late at that time though. What time people get up heavily depends on where they live. I live further out so for an 8:10 to 15:10 day I get up at 6 in the morning, take the bus at 7:22 and arrive at school at about 7:50. Other classmates get up 7:30 cuz they live basically next to the school 🤷‍♀️

In public school I lived way closer to the school so often I'd get up at 7:50, quickly eat and then bike to the school in like 3-5 minutes. School would then end around 14-15 and I'd quickly get home again. 

Even though my hours aren't too bad at gymnasium I'm always super drained when I get home, barely have any energy to do anything at all.",2020-03-22 00:01:49

fmj32p,"Man, every sentence I hear/read that has anything to do with elementary or high school just continues to lower my opinion of it.

For context my experience was atypically good: no bullies, no bad teachers, I started at 9, I never hung out with people outside of school (mostly by choice. I also lived in a rural area so I would never see anyone I knew outside). So I also never heard of other people’s misfortunes about school. But after graduating I started to hang out with my friends more (and made new friends who also went to the same school(s)), and boy, every new story is just another reason to be glad that I never need to go back.

Apparently there was rampant drug abuse, some kid died, some teachers were just plain mean, abusive, and/or just plain bad teachers (I do remember one teacher I had that was supposed to be a French teacher, but 95% of the students were more fluent than her (this is in Grade 9). She was then transferred my brother’s elementary school class (grade 2), from which she stayed for the year then got fired because a lot of the students were still correcting her mistakes).

You can learn bad management from reading a lot of conflicting books though 🙄. Seriously once worked in an office where the owner/manager spent most of every week reading a new self-help “how to manager” book. Every other week started with a really long meeting that was pretty much “throw out all of our policies, this is how we work now”. Weird thing was he had been in that position for almost 20 years! In that time span he had rebranded us something like 8 different times. And even reading all of that management advice, he somehow still completely missed the point. If you tried to talk to him about how erratic and confusing having a new employee manual was every other week you were in for a bad time and maybe a fair amount of yelling.

Don’t believe everything you read on Wikipedia, anyone can edit that information.

OH... I constantly overthink and shame myself/my kinks. I'm just this perpetual naughty, naughty little girl that I, and I alone, end up punishing...which ends up becoming both so gosh damn hot, yet...absolutely damning. I, of course, would rather find that special someone to do all that for me.... :-p But... I do find that my self shaming *does* end up adding to the intensity of my orgasms and fantasies, even more....it is not necessarily healthy though. I guess the fact that it's all so wrong, makes it feel so god damned right lol. Those orgasms become far more intense, the more I build up that humiliation factor....and it strictly has all been just fantasies building up in my head. 

I've lived so many damned alternate ""dream world"" [meaningfully sexual/kinky/taboo and connecting] other lives that have allowed me to express myself in more ways than one...on a universal, other worldly, deep level that only my spirit can truly understand......losing myself in those fake realities, because they are truly so much fucking better than this shitty one....i wish it were real. 2020 sucks, yo!

I do know, eventually, I'm going to have to accept my kinky bad self....add some balance, because it's currently more shame than anything. I need to blossom into the unique little cosmic, sexual lotus that I am. Gotta find a balance somewhere.

I keep traveling down this rabbit hole filled with whimsy and lust...and then I end up regretting all my deepest thoughts...ahem...when I finish...just this ongoing, insecure, very fucked up cycle. I'm creating a toxic environment, for myself, I know. The orgasms are just so fucking amazing, the more I shame, the more and more and more I shame....it's so wrong though.....but it also feels so damned right.

It is so hard to open up with the world, and be who I truly am.... We are such a repressed society and it seems like, more and more, as society changes, there's still no room for those who are the most sexually awakened.

I am an extremely carnal individual that always ends up becoming my own worst enemy. And holy heck, those orgasms....and the more I insert that humiliation....fuck. 😳

*goes back to her dark shadows.*

Honestly, I can elaborate so much more than this...and explain all this better....where I'm not repeating the same words....but....I need to go eat some dinner. All this was pretty rushed to write, but it is all still how I feel. Sorry if it went in circles. My mind is pretty amped up right now...but...I also need a Snickers...I'm hungry!!!",2020-09-30 02:32:35
j29z0j,"I have been thinking about putting some time aside from my crazy, hectic world, to open up and express in great detail....my thoughts. I was once such a great writer. I am a very passionate soul and I bottle myself up too darn much. I used to write so often....now, the only outlet I have is Reddit and Twitter....and as you can see....people don't take kindly to those willing to share their genuine and true emotions. They especially don't take kind to any kind of out-of-the-box thinking. So I guess these occasional rants online will be more effective expressed in my contemplative writing. Getting cozy in a blanket, isolating myself in a comforting corner of my apartment and just...emoting myself fully...in a short story or novel. Yes. I need to find time to do this...maybe someone will enjoy my writing, somewhere.

I’m Filipino and we follow the same practice.

Holiday = Thursday? Might as well make Friday a non-working day too.

Nov. 1 and Nov. 2 are already holidays and, if they’re a Wednesday and Thursday respectively, expect to return to work on Monday. Heck, Oct. 31 will probably be a non-working day or it’s half-day at work.

Dec. 24-26 tend to be non-working days + Christmas; Dec. 30 is a holiday, Dec. 31 is a non-working day, and Jan. 1 is the New Year. Most people will probably just forget to come to work on Jan. 2 as well.

Looks like we have Spain to thank for that practice, hahaha. Thanks, Magellan. 😆

iy7xy3,"Woohoo, you're in for a shock if you think banking in JPY is available all week.  ATMs close not too long after banks do in Japan.

On the US side, there's still a ton of manual processing with retail banking.  Transactions need to be batched, reconciled, and netted off daily.  Not each individual transaction, but each day's total transactions, at least that's what my understanding was when I was on the actual banking side.  After all, you can withdraw and deposit money on the weekends.  Now, granted, I was working in the developing world when I was on that side of the business.

So basically, you can do retail banking, but not institutional banking.  Your bank will ""loan"" you $50, and cover it from their reserves on Monday.  No such system exists to cover a $50,000,000 fuck up — certainly not given that it was in JPY.  \(Okay, not strictly true.  We have a system in place to fix *our* fuck ups so they don't cross a weekend.\)

That said, if you want to get a good idea of why banking shouldn't occur when nobody is in the office, take a look at the theft that the Central Bank of Bangladesh experienced a few years back.  The work week in Bangladesh is Sunday through Thursday.  So on Friday, an ""🇰🇵unknown actor🇰🇵"" went to town wiring hundreds of millions of dollars from Bangladesh's account at the Fed using their Swift credentials, which had been compromised.  \(Their printer was also hacked so that the transaction confirms would not print\)  So it took the Bangladeshis some time on Sunday when they came into work to discover that they'd been robbed.  Their only clue was that they had gotten several OFAC alerts that funds were being wired to a suspicious location that appeared to be under sanctions, and that the funds were blocked pending confirmation.

OFAC, the Office of Foreign Asset Control, is the agency tasked with maintaining a list of entities and individuals under sanctions.  Now, you may wonder how they were able to detect that these wires were being diverted to a sanctioned entity.  We'll, you'll be comforted to know that the system identified that the street name of the bank in the Philippines that some of the wires were diverted to matched... the name of a completely unrelated Greek shipping company with ties to Iran.  So the Bangladesh Central Bank got to work doing everything they could to stop the rest of the wires.  ""Everything they could"" in this case meaning ""fucking nothing"".  It was Sunday.  Nobody at the Fed or their correspondent banks were in the office.  Some of the money was held up, but a lot of it was simply gone.",2020-09-23 20:07:36

See, this is why I’ve always said that SJWs are a blessing, as they reveal the TRUTH about how crooked we are as human beings, especially straight white conservative men (a.k.a. the literal reincarnation of Satan). Reddit is such a sexist website, and it's only proven by disgusting comments like yours.

Reddit's utter insensitivity just baffles me sometimes. For a self-proclaimed ""progressive website,"" you really don't give precedence to any situation outside of your own little cushioned bubble do ya? Well, it's lucky that life hasn't fucked you balls deep in the ass just yet, my friend.

But just watch - once you hit upon on hard times, DON'T YOU COME CRYIN' TO ME! I ain't gonna to be there to wipe your tears off. I ain't gonna be there to wipe the drool off your face. I ain't gonna be there to feed your starved little soul.

No, no.

It'll be all on you. ALL on you. You'll learn how, when life gets you down, it pulls you down. Let's see just how easily you can get out of that and come out sober, mentally healthy, physically healthy, and completely sanitized and innocent!

Answering what question? The post you replied to says ""The birds are more human than we are.""  You know that's not a question, right? (In case you are confused, what I just wrote \*is\* a question.)

You saw a statement about a social science study with birds, then decided to take the opportunity to complain about how you have to pay taxes, a completely unrelated topic.  There was no question there, and you're still an idiot.",2021-03-15 04:00:15
m48hpn,"False, since that would target property owners, while avoiding the mass wealth being used to rent or live abroad. Income taxes, boo boo 😘 Also, corporations shouldn't have the rights of an individual, so increasing their taxes and penalizing external factories so they avoid paying laborers a living wage is also the way to go.

And, okay?

Taxing inheritance wouldn't fix anything. Teaching US citizens that EVERY SINGLE PERSON deserves help, food, and a leg up, NO MATTER WHAT, is the fix. It's like another comment mentioned.

Conservatism (in America) has always been about maintaining class hierarchy and a quasi ethnostate. It evolved from supporting the monarchy (a strong central government) during the revolution, to contradictorily supporting extremely strong states but a weak central government when chattel slavery was under threat by a strong central government.

Conservatism was for a free private sector when it was used to establish economic near slavery over the third world (though they always whined about Japan for some reason 🤔), and against free speech when it was being used for the civil rights movement. 

Now it's against NAFTA and other free trade agreements and pro-tariff now that free trade is resulting in China and other non European countries gaining some dominance. It's suddenly *for* free speech when it comes to obscenities after a century of fighting the ACLU in court over that, but still against kneeling in silent protest... for *some reason*. 

Are you getting my drift? The trajectory of American conservatism makes *no sense* if you take them at their word, but is *100% consistent* if you realize it's just excuses to preserve aristocracy and white Christian ethnic power.",2021-08-18 11:53:40

7zkmy6,"I went to a Catholic School in the late 80s and was taught that the story of Genesis was a parable meant to explain that God created everything. Which makes perfect sense to me. They had no idea so they just said God did it and added the storyline. 

It also opened my previously closed mind, that believed in the story of Genesis as if it were science, and paved the way to my questioning the very existence of God.

I don't know what I identify with specifically except to call myself spiritual. Science doesn't explain everything and, after watching series like How the Universe Works, my mind was blown! I mean, most of what they talked about was brand new to me. Remember, my last encounter with science first hand was in the 80s...I only learned Pluto was downgraded when my daughter told me during homework time a few years ago!

The old Catholic in me decided that something must have created all of this. How can something be created from nothing? Even movies like MiB (giant aliens playing marbles with galaxies and our world being in a locker on another world) and The Matrix (the first one, all of it) actually had me contemplating reality lol.

I say all that to say, being taught that science was real, that evolution is real, by nuns, actually caused me to believe in the Christian God even less.

I actually believe now that we are all just animated and highly intelligent giant organisms that will one day return our atoms to the earth to be recycled. And just in case I'm wrong and we do have souls, I try my best to be kind, especially to those less fortunate than my unfortunate self. Because if there is a heaven, I will get there. And not because I said I believe, but because I lived as righteous a life as possible. It's also much easier to be kind and nice than to be a tool.

When our eyes met, I got goosebumps because I felt like it was my old dog looking back at me. I bent down and he immediately started to lick my face and just showered me with affection. 

I fought hard not to breakdown in front of the owners. I know it’s not the same dog but I felt that my old boy told this new pup all about me and asked him to look after me. 

Needless to say, I’ve applied for adoption and will be bringing him home tomorrow. ❤️",2020-12-10 23:11:44

tj0s71,"My Dad’s side of the family is like this. They are very quiet people and very soft spoken. There’s nothing wrong with any of them, no mental/physical ailments that prevents them from speaking or anything like that, they just are that way. Also they’re all varying degrees of quiet, but by far my Grandma is the most silent. She will not speak unless spoken to. Her replies/answers are short and usually one or a few words. She doesn’t do it out of rudeness, her quiet personality is just who she is. I love her nonetheless though, she is the sweetest Grandma 🤍

My Dad on the other hand, I’ve been told his silence came off as rude. He would literally not speak to anyone at his jobs, or classmates, etc. Rarely made friends, but mostly cause he didn’t care to have any. He would talk to my Mom but that was about it lol.  

As for me, I’ve been told by a lot of people including friends, teachers, people I’ve dated, etc that I’m also very quiet and soft spoken, but I don’t think I’m as bad as my Dad or Grandma. I actually do like having conversations with people, I’m just usually hesitant to be the first to speak.",2022-03-21 11:52:33
