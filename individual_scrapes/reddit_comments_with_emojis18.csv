So much so, the top comment is from OP explaining the art? 

Amazing painting regardless, but does this not reflect our current contradictory nature/society?

ajs0pj,"Swing and a miss on the symbolism

So...

A dog killed another dog.

A dog killed another dog that was trying to find food to not starve to death Bc they would’ve otherwise died on a veggie diet and in such harsh terrain...and the sheep was careless enough to wonder into another dog’s home... and due to its carelessness another dog from a different home, killed this dog in its own home for a trespassing sheep 

So...

Sheep can never be their own shepherds? 

So..

The dog that was hunting in its own territory for food to feed itself and/or pack, doesn’t deserve the same acceptance into the cicle of life?

So......

We encourage dogs to kill their own kind?
 
...please elaborate your expectations for dogs and their “sacred duty” to kill each other 🤦‍♀️ maybe sheep should stay with their flock, because they’re causing unwarranted death  ",2019-01-26 14:20:09

My grandma was a very strong woman, she teached me how to work hard and not break down due to disease and problems. Her last battle was the fight against breast cancer, but then the meeting with the covid. Her body could not stand it, but morally she held on as strong as she could.

I hope you stay strong,
and never stop creating.
You clearly have some real talent and skill, and it’d be a shame to stop sharing it with the world.*

Your work is both heartwarming and painful, but beautiful nonetheless. Thanks for sharing and I’m sorry for your loss ❤️

Edit: Thanks to everyone who commented. I’m not ready to accept that she’s gone just yet, I’m going to wait until I hear the official news and in the mean time I’m still hoping for a miracle, but thanks for your kind words.

zlgs95,"""Taking a picture is easier than using AI"" 🤡

Love how in a another comment you mentioned having a ""Masters in Fine Art"" I'll go ahead and call bs. No respectable artist thinks this way, a camera is not a magic picture box that takes perfect photos everytime, I learned photography for a good year and am still nowhere near as good as even amateur photographers with a passion for it, but yeah go ahead and explain to us how the intricacies of working a camera, framing, and editing are somehow easier than typing ""purple mountain range with sunset"" into a generator 💀

Also an AI doesn't ""reference"" images, it samples them. Without any images to take, the AI can't make art, while a human, even having never seen art in their life, could still create. ""Art"" in general doesn't require skill or knowledge necessarily, just creativity, something only humans have.

But having categories in art is okay, it’s just different times and era etc. personally I’m an Impressionism fan. And don’t get me wrong that painting is insane, and you have serious talent. But what I like most is that you said you spent 10 hours a day for 3 weeks on this piece. That kind of passion is so needed in the art world today. So many 20 year olds who think they are such unique and creative minds who spend 20 minutes on a drawing and post it on insta haha.

665fn8,"Got an update, from the artist!

>Lol! I just read all the Reddit posts and I love it! Thanks for sharing that with me and no you aren't disturbing me at all 
I think it's amazing that people would be interested enough in my work to not only make an animated gif comparing the the painting I ended up with to an earlier stage I had posted, but that they would go as far as to make a difference map between the two! Lol! I love it. I honestly think that it's awesome! I couldn't be happier.
I'll see if I can address some of the points and give a little background on the painting. Maybe you can share this with the people on the discussion you are participating in.

>First of all, I want to say that I doesn't bother me that people question whether this is a painting vs digital. My work has never been about the technique, nor do I paint to show off my technique. The important thing to me is the subject matter and the emotion. Empathy and beauty are other qualities I care about. The technique is simply a way to get where I want to go and to say what I want to say. There are some really amazing digital artist working today and I would not want to diminish the work they do by getting angry and acting as if somehow digital art is somehow a lesser art. In my opinion it isn't. Some of the CG artists working today are the Michelangelos and DaVincis of yesterday.

>I started this painting in 2007 and played around with it until about 2009. One of my collectors loved the painting almost from the first block-in and begged to take it off my easel and to let me sell it to him as is. I told him that I would have to finish the painting first. He left the country for six months (he's not from the US), and came back to see if I had finished the painting and was disappointed to find that I had done only a little work on it. To be honest, I felt there were compositional problems and I didn't know how to resolve those problems. (I still feel that way). Finally, I gave in and sold him the unfinished painting off the easel thinking that someday I might do another version. 😞 Maybe someday.

>When I started this painting, I was still doing illustration for a living and my workflow was geared toward making a faster painting. When I did illustration, I would do the underpainting, or the block-in using acrylic paint at a very thin consistency and then I would come in with oils to finish. Some of the acrylic paint shows through in places where I didn't get to cover with oils. I still consider this basically an oil painting since the acrylic is only the block in.
The way I blend strokes in acrylic, is different than the way I blend in oils because the acrylic dries so fast (an advantage in illustration). 

>In oil, I blend by smudging the paint together evenly across an edge, or sometimes by mixing a transitional tone, or sometimes by blending as I apply the paint. For blending in oil, I use anything from a bristle brush, to a sable brush. Sometimes I use a toothbrush, sometimes I use a make-up pad, and I have been known to even use a brillo pad. Lol, I'm crazy that way.

>When I blend with acrylic, I often have to use a very different technique because the edges are often already dry. In those cases I use multiple passes of very thin, transparent acrylic glazes up and down the whole transitional area and use a blow drier to speed up the layering process. That explains the evenness of the blended edges. That evenness is something that is rare when you paint wet on wet but very common when you work wet over dry.

>When I block-in the painting with acrylic, I very often use house painting brushes. I also use the sponge brushes you buy at a hardware store (they hold a lot more liquidy paint than traditional brushes and give an even tone throughout the whole stroke. Also acrylic kills your brushes, it's cheaper to use throw away brushes). I sometimes use sponges. I have a whole array of natural and synthetic sponges in my kit for this purpose! If you look carefully, you can see the heavy use of sponge brushes in areas where the acrylic underpainting shows through. 

>When I was working on this painting, I had access to a large format scanner and scanned it at different stages in it's creation. I posted some of those on the different art community sites at different stages which explains why there are different stages of the painting floating around the internet. I would always place the painting up to the upper right hand corner of the scanner to scan the painting.

>Just before the collector took my painting home with him, I got a large resolution scan (which I kept on a thumbdrive for a few years. The large format scanner is probably why the different versions align pixel perfect with each other. )
Around 2010, I decided that I wanted to enter the print market and that my Multitasking painting was a great candidate for the print market. But I wasn't completely happy with the version I sold the collector and I couldn't get the original back since it was now out of the country. So, I took my high resolution file and took it to a print service shop and had a print made on paper. I mounted the print onto a board and then sealed it with clear acrylic gel in order to do a little more painting on it. I added a little to the top, and to the left where I got my wife to pose again for the reflection in the mirror. We were now living in a different apartment and had a different bathroom, so it was hard to get it to look right, but I decided it was good enough. I then touched up the outer areas using oil paint, added a few glazes. I also redefined  her hair using oil paint. During that time I made two scans at different stages as I progressed on the painting and those are out there somewhere because I posted them in various places. I kept procrastinating, still didn't finish it to where I wanted to get it, and still wasn't sure whether or not I liked the painting, though I loved the idea. I finally gave in or gave up, lol! and made a final version to send to my online print gallery. That image is the final image and the one that is on my facebook page.

>There is a comment somewhere about strokes not moving in the same direction as the paint. That happens when the underpainting is thick and the details are thinly painted on top, which is something I do a lot. I don't like that look anymore and these days I scrape down the dried underpainting with a palette knife before I put in the details. 
There are a few areas where I cleaned up the the glare on the striations of the brushwork using Photoshop, to get it ready for print before sending it up to my online gallery. I found the glare distracting and is the only work I did on the digital file of my painting, (besides the normal preproduction precessing for print.)

>This painting is a transitional painting for me because I made it at a time when I was transitioning out of illustration and beginning to think about more serious work. It has been quite a journey. I would not have sold it if I had known it was going to cause such a stir. It's been flagged many times on Facebook and thank goodness Facebook always does the right thing. It has created a conversation about breast-feeding and the role of the working and non-working mother (all mothers work hard whether they stay at home or go to a day job). There is even a thread on Reddit on whether it should be flagged as pornographic or obscene.

>It's been shared over a million times and has been used in hundreds of blogs and magazines all over the world. It reached a front page on Reddit!!! People have so identified with it that I've actually gotten Facebook Messenger messages and emails from people all over the world. One man even threatened to kill me because he wanted to know how I made this painting of his wife!!!! He thought I was having an affair with her! I'm not kidding! 

>Several woman wanted to know how I was able to make this picture of them and one woman threatened to sue me because as she said, ""this is photo my husband took of me and he used a program (sic) to make it a painting!"" She thought I was a hacker who somehow got into her hard drive and stole the picture! She told me that she would have her lawyer contact me if I didn't remove every single instance of this image from the internet! I looked her up and she wasn't a crazy (though this is crazy), she was a professional corporate working woman! Lol, I had to show her pictures of my wife and I prove to her that this painting is much older than her daughter! 

>I love the fact that I have people making difference maps of the different stages of my painting just to prove it's somehow not real! I guess if it isn't real (whatever that means), then the message is gone! 😀  (to be honest, the geek in me is so flattered by this that I can't control myself!)

>Interestingly, there are Chinese and Russian knock offs of my painting floating around the internet. One Chinese site, which has since been taken down, sold 8x10 versions of my painting claiming they were original oil paintings! They were selling them for $35! What they were doing was painting over a print of my painting! And the funny thing was that they were using one of the earlier WIPs of my painting! Lol, I wanted to buy one and fix it up! Lol, but the site was taken down before I could. It's a shame because I'm actually flattered not upset that someone would make a knock-off of my painting! There might be some of those still floating around the internet. 

>As an artist, I couldn't ask for anything better than what is happening and hope it happens to some of my other paintings someday.

>Anyway, thanks for reaching out to me. Please share this message and thank everyone for the attention. I love it!

As for oni 鬼, the original comment isn't necessarily wrong. This is the case where the original meaning from China and the adopted form deviates later in Japan differs. 鬼 Indeed refers to evil spirits or any bad supernatural creatures in general, but now means a much more speicific one type of Monster demon in Japan 👹. Same thing happened with Tengu 天狗, which literally means ""celestial dog"", originally a doglike creature that represented shooting stars.

Sorry about your family, I can relate, but I’m happy you reached out to your friend! They were probably really happy to hear from you too! Your problems aren’t silly.

If your soul, or whatever makes up the essence of you, is able to live on in a non human form after your body dies I don't think ""power"" would matter to it anymore. No longer bound by a clunky human body, no longer busy thinking about human-created issues, living in total divine silence, shedding the human ego... it sounds peaceful. Not... powerful.

Edit: wait holy shit I was just making bad jokes but I wasn't far off (from their tumblr):

""Wondering about these weird long titles on my pieces? Well, they’re all modified excerpts from a spooky book called “The Prophecies of the Brahan Seer” (published in 1899) which I pulled randomly off a shelf in the occult section of a used book store in Vancouver a couple weeks ago; the Brahan Seer was allegedly the invention of the author as no other record of him exists, but lines from the book are so metal I couldn’t resist using them as inspiration for the titles of a body of work about mystical animal revenge 🌸""

o7ldz9,"Well I can’t stop looking at it so here are some specifics. Warning: I’ve not ever tried articulating why I like what I like. 

The lightest plane of the face being the forehead makes the rest of the face recede in a way that makes it seem even more elongated. It “drags down” the rest of the face. Which in turn amplifies the somber tone. Emotional response, ✅

I really like the high level of detail for the focal point that so quickly transitions to minimal detail. I think that funnels the eye back to the focal point so effectively. The eye can’t help but return to the focal point. Which in turn triggers an emotional response, at least for me. My brain interprets the sensation of returning to the focal point as “this subject is “captivating”.",2021-06-25 13:07:58

But yeah, I'd start with that book and go from there. He has some of the best stories, and I think everyone can learn a lot from Tony even if he's no longer here. ♥️",2021-06-25 15:37:49

It’s a totally instinctual reaction. But when it comes down to it, every one of those Ukrainians that are staying and fighting has the love of the entire world at their back. It’s sad to say more will most likely die but they will each die as hero’s fighting for their home. And it’s sad to see the Russian fighters die as well because they didn’t ask for war. They’re only doing this because of poor choice orders from their leaders, if they ran, they would probably be killed knowing how Russia is. The only thing we can hope for is the war ends before too many Ukrainian lives are lost and hope these 2 lovers in the picture above can reunite safely. 🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️",2022-02-26 22:29:39

The mom couldn’t care less, cousin didn’t care, my dad just randomly said we had to do it.  Well I try telling Dad that the kid is a menace.  When we’re over there he’s too damn wild.  Nope, it’d be rude apparently. 

Everything is going fine, until I walk back into my room.  Little bro cousin has flipped my whole mattress off my bed, thrown off all my blankets across the room.  My bed (top bunk) also had a lot of nick knacks, drawing materials, & my gameboy.  Little fuck threw everything everywhere.  The room was a mess.  I got so damn heated, pulled my dad and yelled at him.  “This is why I told you!  I dont ever want him here again!” Lolz.  We laugh about it now, & we all still hang out.

y2cd87,"This comment really resonated with me and my life, so I want to share something with you. Hopefully this gives you some sort of perspective. 

My mother passed away at 42 from cancer, l was three at the time and my brother was almost two. Growing up without a mother is challenging, and I can’t even imagine how hard it must have been at times for my dad to raise my brother and I alone.

But I will say this: I’m 23 now and I find immense peace and comfort knowing that my mother loved me dearly, and that she would have been apart of my life if she could have. 

I have friends whose parents have either chosen not to be apart of their children’s lives, or don’t deserve to be a part of their lives, and it’s incredibly sad to see. There’s a huge difference between having a parent who has abandoned you, and one that was taken from you, and your children will come to understand this.

As they grow, please tell them everything you can possibly remember about their mother: every funny moment, every crazy story, everything. In a way, I feel like I know my mother very well even though I hardly remember her, and I LOVE hearing new things about her from her friends and family. 

As for yourself, I can’t imagine what you’re experiencing and I’m so sorry for your loss. My dad always told me that the only way he could cope with her death was to pour his heart and soul into loving my brother and I, and to keep himself busy.

I know for a fact that it wasn’t easy for my dad, but I can tell you that the bond that a single parent forms with their children is indescribable. Myself, my brother, and my father are closer than just about any other family I know, and I’m certain it’s related to what we’ve been through together. 

If you love and care for your children anywhere near as much as my father did for me, when your kids grow up they will slowly understand the challenges that you’ve overcome as a single dad, and they will respect and admire you more than you can imagine. My dad is my fucking hero.

Also, for what it’s worth: 20 years later my dad is incredibly happy and is quite literally living his best life. My family will never forget my mother, but my dad has healed and moved forward with his life. I’m sure it’s hard to imagine right now but please remember:

It does get better… Time heals all wounds.

Good luck ❤️",2022-10-13 07:09:16
y2cd87,I agree 💯,2022-10-12 23:02:25

dgk8ss,"With that mindset, you’re right. Do not forget that this country is still very well off. Just like now, having a conversation about our opinions. A mass majority of other countries can’t do the smallest of things that we take for granted. Unity is about people coming together right? Much like the Hong Kong protests. If we wanted, we could do the same thing with a peaceful presence and as history has shown, get results if the unification is strong enough. We’re a great nation. Those that think the opposite should take a minute to reflect on what they can do daily and relate it to others. We may have speed-bumps but in time things will change. With respect. 👍",2019-10-11 23:25:50
dgk8ss,"Cause it’s something that we’ve as a nation have fought to facilitate for the past 200+ years. Many men and women have died for the ability for us to have a pursuit of happiness. We can shame the flag and talk about our president negatively or have different religions and go to the supermarket and buy whatever we want. We can even wear whatever we want. It’s nice to look back and have that flag as a symbol that shows the struggle of Martin Luther King and the women’s suffrage movement and how they prevailed because our system we worked hard to put into place. We are a great nation not only because of our history but because we are an ever evolving nation. We help people and other countries and have thousands of charities that aid through our organization of the system. Are there flaws? Yes!! But we should not demonize our country because of issues we’re currently having. We should be proud because of our history in establishing what can come after issues are met with the people. Our country is great but no one is perfect. Plus, we all have different opinions and we should converse and respect each other with an open mind. 

I know it’s long but I take pride in our country, regardless who is in office. I hope this can aid in a productive conversation. 👍",2019-10-11 23:57:10

I agree with this but that's clearly not the case for the painting so I don't see why it's relevant.


Let me get this straight, you're saying that it's more likely someone made this art so they could farm karma to sell their account for a couple hundred dollars rather than it just being art..

7nvd8p,"This is going to sound negative and I don't mean it to be! I think you've got a great start and clearly have the ability to render fine details. My biggest suggestion is to focus on that less so that your forms and sculptural elements have depth. Right now it comes off very flat. Consider the eye focus and rendering only where you want focus with those fine details. General to specific, broad strokes to fine. Blah blah blah.

br8tdw,"I think this artist is tricking us wickedly. I as the viewer, have crossed the street since the family passed me.

See. 

If i remain stationery the car will pass me going left, on the way there, and right on the way back.

But if you look through the window, you can see a green scene on one side in the sun going, but a lamp lit on the other side coming home.

To join them up, to know we are in the exaxt same position but now on the other side of the road, look at the reflection of the plant in the door going left. Now see the plant through the window on the opposite side coming home. Its the same plant exactly. 

So as the viewer i have crossed the road, but if that were the case there and back would be the same direction depicted in the picture. Hence the illusion. 

AWESOME.

Edit... or if you prefer without the illusion, then it means this family is lost, and has traveled in a large loop from noon to dusk, without actually arriving. 😊

edit 2...but then the driver would be in the same side.. so.. an illusion. lol.",2019-05-23 12:53:58

Perhaps it cause it lacks a layer of artistic observing eye  engangment if that makes sense. She’s technically very gifted but graph lines or projection is a valid but ordinary representation of the scene.

It could be where he came from, why he's suddenly in the 3D world, or something else I'm not thinking of. But the secondary and imo more interesting question is why is he looking back at all? After what appears to be a tough slog to get to the 3D world (as evidenced by the deep trough in the painting) he decides to stare back at the 2D world he came from. It could be a piece about remembering your roots, or letting your past define you, or a play on the saying the grass is always greener, or expectations exceeding reality. But instead this message gets pushed to the background with a pose that instead forces you to ask ""what is he thinking about?"" A neutral pose would instead put focus on why he's facing backwards which I think is more interesting and thought provoking. In any case it's interesting that such a small change can so drastically alter the meaning of a piece",2017-07-08 13:45:46

Seriously, looks like you're more interested in appearing like a deep thinker than actually analysing the piece. Because those ""interpretations"" are clearly forced and are trite as hell.

""DAE WE ARE THE UNIVERSE EXPERIENCING ITSELF OMG LET'S TAKE ANOTHER HIT""  

Not to mention the smugly, obnoxiously pretentious tone of it all... No, this piece isn't saying anything about evolution or ""the cosmos""... Jesus Christ, man...

🤷‍♂️ what do you expect though. It was nighttime. 

You don’t have to hunt to feed yourself. 
Life expectancy is the highest it’s ever been. 
You’re probably not gonna die from a broken leg like you would have for the rest of the history of the world. 

Murder rates are the lowest they’ve ever been. 

Like now is the the easiest time in the history of humanity to be able to survive.

Boobs being sexual has absolutely NOTHING to do with Muslims and Islam. Not only are you pathetically ignorant and obviously islamiphobic but you can't get passed the idea that breasts are sexual. 

No matter what religion, culture, country you are from. 

Sit the fuck down because you obviously have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. You literally sound like a SJW thumping her idiotic book of ideas that thinks she's right about when really you're just absolutely wrong.

6a5dby,"When you do mouths try to focus on the line between the upper lip and the lower lip, not sure how to explain it but I usually focus on the negative space/dark parts of the mouth and this will start to form the mouth.

blkitp,"Man! You made my day! I've got inspired by a pic on pinterest of a scenario similar to this, and I've got fascinated by the tiles as well! That's why I used em. I'm not usually a big fan of tiles tbh, but they gave the right mood to the piece and also the tiling helped with the perspective, supporting the eye movement with the grid pattern. This added extra depth and sense of the lens distortion. 👀",2019-05-07 06:08:27

blkitp,"Haha 😂 I made the door locked on purpose, I thought could be interesting from an adventure/videogame vibes point of view (how are they going to move the vending machine to access?).

About the machine technical aspect, well, I've got inspired by Japanese vending machines, but I didn't really wanted to make an exact reproduction of one of them. I like to leave some aspects of my drawings naive and free, because when I get too technical my drawings loose the power and become stiff.

I use this approach even on perspective and other technical aspects.

Anyways thanks for the in depth explanation, I love Japan! 🇯🇵",2019-05-07 05:57:44

Why treat the person who’s literally helping you raise your child like shit? Why do they deserve shit pay and more duties?? Why don’t we deserve a fucking livable wage that we can someday afford a house and family of our own someday are we not deserving wtf????? And then you don’t protect us either. You don’t protect our kids either.

This system is fucked we need something to happen idk what but fuck man this is too much for the teachers to handle alone buck the fuck up and help them fuck the red/blue who just keep arguing and doing nothing, get a fucking purple who will actually do something this is all going to implode unless we actually fucking work on it properly pay our teachers not shit and remember the kids who need help too fuck stop ignoring us and accept this issue needs a lot of long term help and money and aide going into it or we’ll never get better ugh it’s like they’ve never heard of taking care of their own I guess children and teachers and disabled and disadvantaged the elderly and poor are just forgotten about whatever fuck you all who don’t care about us we’re keeping the world moving and growing and you’re hogging everything and making us suffer wtf something needs to change seriously 😡",2022-05-29 18:09:34

They’re also carrying a sign about the separation of church and state, which is suspicious. I suppose it could be a reference to being caught in the middle of evolution vs. creationism “debates”, but it’s still like.. not an undue burden.

j93glt,"I'm terribly sorry, I did not mean to sound condescending but realise I must have (it's late where I am so I'm not great at expressing myself). I just meant to clarify as I know many people assume all letters in our alphabet has a direct counter in hireoglyphs (I did before I started) and my over clarification mainly comes from an obsessive interest and a want to share my fascination with a subject I'm deeply passionate about. (Also somewhat damaged from working on it hahaha, I mean it's a beautiful art piece, accuracy isn't really necessary 😂)

Although you have a point, I do have to say that in that case the letters in the picture are as much ancient Egyptian as ""gaga"" is English, which means not at all. The influence is so heavy that I'd say it's an attempt to use actual hieroglyphs but it falls short. But absolutely, the meaning is one thing, but to call I hieroglyphs if they're not actual hieroglyphs is just straight up wrong, it's like calling something Russian when half the letters aren't even real.",2020-10-11 23:05:23

bjkaht,"I don’t know if this makes any sense but I used to have sleep paralysis and would experience it often. The one time I hallucinated was when my ex was in the house but sleeping downstairs, and I woke up seeing this dark figure standing in my doorway, just staring at me. But I couldn’t  move or yell for help of course. When I finally snapped out of it I saw it was actually daylight and my door was closed, not open. 

The weird thing is, since that person and I broke up, I’ve never had an episode of sleep paralysis again. We dated nearly 6 years and I had it the entire time of our relationship, but not once since 🤷🏻‍♀️",2019-05-01 23:22:23

I’m not sad but I am?” So then I started laughing about that, which made me cry harder. It was like I got stuck in my own trap.

jfhi7g,"I’m so sorry to hear that. I generally have worse periods than a lot of other women I know, but I’m aware that mine are mere blips to what other women experience. I was born anemic so I get it on some level, though I never needed transfusions, just very high doses of iron. My doctors never wanted me to have the IUD or implant just because of the possibility of constant bleeding. I was on the pill for two years, it made me a psycho at first and then I got used to it, but it eventually made me feel like crap. Just got off it about a month ago. I definitely didn’t miss the kind of PMS I experienced before BC, but I can manage. I’m sorry such drastic measures have to be taken so you don’t have to go through that kind of pain anymore, but I’ll be glad to know you get some kind of relief ❤️",2020-10-21 20:56:08

65isaq,Happy to hear this. Congratulations beautiful stranger ❤️,2017-04-15 17:13:52
65isaq,"This picture resonated with me. All these people commenting, ""It's just a selfie,"" don't seem to get the idea of what this picture is portraying. Mental illness is no joke and even getting to the point where you can smile, where you do feel better sometimes, where you feel comfortable showing yourself to the world... its a journey. Maybe to some its not art, but to me it is. Controversy is common with art anyway. Everyone has an opinion. 

Anyway, I love when simple pictures make me feel something deep, so great job! I'm glad you're recovering and I'm grateful you shared it with us. ❤",2017-04-15 17:22:17
65isaq,"If you don't know DestinyBlue, then of course your not going to understand this picture. 

DestinyBlue is a kind, caring, and creative artist who uses her art to tell bits and parts of her story. She has been struggling with an ongoing battle with depression and is slowly recovering. She opens up her story to let people know that those who have depression are not alone.

This picture she posted was supposed to a be a recreation of one of her art pieces. DestinyBlue always takes pictures of course, and because us, her followers, ask her to. It's different to see someone's life from their prospective and we're all looking for change and something different. With her blue hair and unique art, we chose Blue! She's an amazing artist by no shadow of a doubt. We thank her for her time and effort, and especially her courage. We love and support you Blue!💙",2017-04-15 15:30:07

65isaq,"She isn't, but she's feeling better. There's a difference between those two things; I've read her story on Deviantart and I can 100% say she isnt fully happy, but shes doing better, shes able to stay in enough control of herself to not be in a care facility for mentally unstable people like she was. I highly recommend reading her story, its on Deviantart under Destinyblue ☺",2017-04-15 15:45:21

94iovh,"Dude, you do you. I love it.

 The explanation you added is exactly what I wish people would understand about art. Most of the time a idea pops in your head from a observation in the abstract, it becomes its own little thing , and you execute it to a finished piece.  While some art is seriously created in a attack against something or a large statement, for me it always is like you, a abstract concept knocks around and I eventually refine it and put it to paper. The fun happens after that when people start creating there own stories and commenting on it. 

I think this is a dope  piece and thank you for sharing. 

Full disclosure, I’m 39 going on 14 and a half.

94iovh,"People define themselves by their “knowledge,” for better or worse. Then they lose sight of the big picture (art is an expression, there 👏are 👏no 👏 rules). They ignore this, in order for their ego to survive as it feeds off their ability to feel right, about something. I hate snobs. Listen, any hobby I’m passionate and know a lot about, guitar, playing pool... I’m not gonna bitch about someone playing wonderwall. But every cover is different in its own way. And if people are appreciating your artistic style then who cares if the concept has been done. People fucking love covers in music, but not on Reddit, not today. I’m sorry I don’t buy it. Reddit is insecure today. ",2018-08-05 01:38:40

nj46w4,"Ah sorry, I don't have anything in particular. If anything, if you ever want to learn I'd suggest learning about the colour wheel (primary, secondary and tertiary colours) and with that you should find out what colours to mix to get the colour you desire.

Afterwards it's about warm and cold colours and then pastels. 

I don't remember the term, but also learn about how dominant each colour is when used in a painting. For example you don't need a lot of yellow in a painting to make it the ""dominant"" colour, violet needs more to become dominant and etc!


The first colour I recommend learning to mix together is beige, it's a tricky one but once you get it you can kinda understand warm vs cold and how much each primary colour works when mixing colours. 
     I learned for example that blue is extremely tricky and can easily be too much, yellow is the one you can use the most and red can also be a bit tricky.



In general the very basics of colour theory is incredibly easy and shouldn't take more than 10-20 minutes to explain. Any youtube video about colour theory shouldn't be too far off.

I 100% recommend painting/colouring the colour wheel while you have it explained to you, so you can actually see how tricky each colour is to mix.

I swear it's easy once you've begun to learn though. I had art in college for half a year, two lessons in and we had covered basically every angle of colour theory. 

Good luck though! ❤️",2021-05-24 00:05:58

7z4uro,"🎶I am a shark,

Living in a vast world of dark

Maybe in magazines,

You've seen me cos I'm a star

Baby, now I embark

With a dream in my heart.

Soon you will see me there

With a crown in my hair, because



Where this shark shines, he shines at terror

But I think there is something better.

Just remember, fish are friends

Took an oath, never gonna eat one again

Wanna be dainty, shy, and clever,

Prettier than any other

You can swim safe under Finderella

You can swim safe under Finderella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay

Maybe they live in two different cities, see only once a week and think about each other but will eventually be together again ☺️  

Or maybe the top one represents a day when she leaves for work and it's his day off, while the bottom one is when her bf/husband left for work! Definitely nicer to see it this way :)",2018-07-18 09:51:17

17zk62p,"I’m responding to what you’re writing. 

You may not like the response, so it’s going “too far” in your opinion, and you’re entitled to it. 

I don’t know you and haven’t formed any opinion about you outside of this small exchange here.

You and I may be absolute delights or absolute shits.😂 

Neither of us knows other than what’s being discussed presently. 

Movements as you refer were established because of the lack of societal improvements for historically targeted groups. 

People often denigrate Affirmative Action/School Choice based on race, “Black” groups/Asian groups, etc…without paying due recognition to the REASONS those groups were established in the first place. 

They’re not shutting themselves out from something they weren’t allowed into from the inception. 

They are making their own way in since none was given when they asked nicely. 

Last I knew, art as beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 

You nor I can stop the way a person feels when they encounter a thing. Especially when the person encounters a thing that has historical negative associations with that person’s lineage. 

If you think you are tired of hearing about race…how do you think the people living the discrimination feel? 

It’s been literal centuries of a global caste system…to the point most cultures have disowned darker family or have terms to “whiten the race”. 

No, there’s no improvements, other than the crosses have stopped being burned on peoples lawns, because as I stated, it mostly was not a mutual change but a forcing of hands and even that is attempting to be clawed back. 

You know this but choose to remain obtuse. 

A simple Google of the number of CEO’s or pay wage gap among ethnicities will show you. 

So still, in 2023, with “Black” women being the most educated women and “Black” and Hispanic men being highly skilled at labor, only a FEW “civilized” ethnic folk know how to supervise or manage businesses? 

But almost all whites, especially white men, well, they’re just “naturally” gifted at everything?!? So of course they get all of the top positions.🙄

For real? 😂
We all know, so please stop. 

As Jane Elliot asked, “If “Black” people are over exaggerating and making up their ill treatment, who in this room would trade places with them?” 

Not ONE hand is raised because you ALL know what’s going on. 

So please just stop playing like you don’t.",2023-11-24 02:32:53

Not policing a person’s perception of a thing of beauty or art. 

However, if that’s all you gleaned from this, well, that’s on you. 

You can gaslight yourself all night if you like.

About what? You must be young.😂

There’s nothing either of us wrote to be mad about…especially from the internet as you stated.

I don’t think it’s fair to exclude AI Art from being considered art. Imagine you develop a disease or disability that doesn’t allow you to create art any longer. AI Art takes the human generated idea -> computer generated art. 

To me, AI Art is Art still, because the creative idea still comes from a person. The AI part just brings it to life.

We’re all in such a hurry to make money, be productive, and get a leg up, that none of us are paying attention to the harm we’re doing to ourselves and others. 

You ask how AI is different from someone being influence by another artist, and I can only roll my eyes. If someone influences your art, it means you’ve studied it, you’ve worked on it, and you fundamentally understand the processes used to get to the destination. Copying someone’s style is still a journey of discovery. You still have to learn to emulate the brush strokes, utilize color theory in a similar manner, practice on that medium, etc. 

Meanwhile, generative technology only requires you type “aliens at a disco painted by Claude Monet”. It’s not even in the same stratosphere for comparison. C’mon. 

Also nice stealth jab, if you wanna insult my talent, be big enough to say it, not just suggest it 😂 Nobody likes a polite coward.

In a nutshell, yes. When a company gives you the free service to generate X, they are utilizing those data metrics to sell the software package to corporations for millions. 

How much time was spent rendering? How many images? How many users? How many reviews? How many times the images have been shared online with hashtags, etc. All of these tiny actions are just “counters going up by one” that get added to a big data pool, slapped on a PowerPoint, and then an exec or business owners makes a decision to lay off a percentage of employees that will offset the cost and increase their profit margin. 

It all seems innocuous, but even a “data counter going up by one” has consequences. Especially when 10 million other folks don’t see the issue with a counter going up by one, and now it’s gone up by 10 million.",2024-01-09 00:56:44

Look again. Literally put them side by side. I said quite similar, not identical. Similar enough to immediately have me think of specific figures in that iconic composition.

>I've seen it multiple times in person, they are overwhelming, but in a positive way and the colors are way more muted and the number of figures help to spread it out, not just big blocks of color like in this picture.

I see her as a woman full of despair.  She is a young newlywed married for six months to her husband; but from the minute they were married, he began to abuse her physically, sexually and emotionally.  How does she now let her husband know she is pregnant with their first child?  Does she stay or will she run as far away as she can, never to look back?

If you really want to go down into the rabbit hole of what your definition of art is, I'll pass 😆.

1acd5bp,"I am sorry you've been jumped on, I certainly don't think saying you liked a piece warrants a shit storm. I went out of my way to say my qualm was not with the picture. To refresh you on your own comment- 

>Are you sure you want to debate anatomy (or beauty in general) with me? 😅
Didn’t you have a look at, like, my profile picture?

To put it another way- 'are you sure you want to challenge me?' Which yeah, implied they may not want to because you're the expert in the situation and *that* was my issue. 

You can and should post your skull studies. You should feel free to tell other artists when you enjoy their work. Your freedom of speech is intact- your comment is still standing and you were able to reply to me. Freedom of speech is not freedom from disagreement, criticism or consequence. In terms of defending yourself- I think my feedback was warranted. I don't think you are a bad person, a person who is wrong or shitty. But this kind of response to disagreement IS something I think you could and should think about challenging and shifting, because it makes art communities and subsequently experiences in art communities, worse. 

Anyway, above all I hope this isn't something that takes up an unwarranted or disproportionate amount of space for you. It's a moment on the internet, life is much bigger than that. Ultimately we are both two art nerds, so though I've offered you criticism, I will also say I hope you will be well.",2024-01-28 15:30:15

Outside of war and natural disasters their human food supply would be almost non-existent. This particular species reminds me of the acorn weevil, so a possibility is an adult cranium weevil will lay her eggs in a human skull, where the larvae can reach brain matter that the adult cannot reach. Shortly afterwards the larvae make their way out of the skull and into the soil, where they can remain dormant for up to five years until pupating into an adult. In certain parts of the world there's always an event that causes mass human death at least once every five years or less, and so the larvae simply stay dormant until the smell of hundreds of dead humans reaches it. They then pupate into adults, all rising up from the soil where the last mass human death occurred, and make their way to the next as a single massive swarm.

The cranium weevil hasn't always swarmed like this, but once humans started burying their dead the weevils had to adapt. There's only a few places in the whole world where the cranium weevils original lifecycle can be observed, with the most notable place being the Aokigahara Forest on Honshu island, Japan.

Synesthesia colors and shapes inspired by marcyplayground

This piece is just about the rituals I do with my synesthesia. Listening to sounds and translating it into physical form for everyone to see what I “see” when listening to music.

I photograph landscapes and paint them in my post processing to match the colors to the  music I listen to. This goes with shapes as well.

Photographed in Death Valley. Multiple exposures to get the exact shades I needed in order to color the photograph in post.",2024-04-18 17:02:49

1bknw3n,"Thank you! 🩷 For me I find meaning in it in a very personal way - at the time I was experiencing a lot of abuse in my family and recovering from emotional abuse from an ex partner, and working on this drawing was cathartic and healing. I was finding difficulty in not being dragged down by negative emotions and feelings. I’m in a really healthy environment and relationship today and have learned a lot since, but am still a work in progress and have anxiety and ocd. For me the monster’s hand gripping the girl’s leg is representative of my intrusive thoughts and feelings that attempt to drag me down, and how I do my best to stay self regulated, authentic, and true to myself whether that be trying to empower women through my illustrations or attempting to shift people’s minds on women and our physical autonomy. I’m sorry for my rambling, sometimes I have trouble articulating what it is I want to communicate which is why I think I attempt to do so through drawing and imagery. I hope anyone that looks at this can find meaning in it that’s personal to them or feel some kind of emotion. Thank you for your kind words 🩷",2024-03-22 06:07:19

1bknw3n,Thank you so much 🩷,2024-03-22 09:59:13
1bknw3n,Oh no! I didn’t mean to imply anything negative about it. It’s just it has a very particular shape and I guess I kept trying to “place” it at something. (Like an ostomy bag. Or maybe something suggestive that I was too asexual to recognize 😅),2024-03-22 05:00:39

1bknw3n,"No worries at all, I didn’t take it that way! 🩷 I’ve had to laugh about it before because years ago someone asked if she was holding something sexual - I think they asked if it was a condom or something and I felt a sweep of embarrassment back then 😹 I’m learning to accept it the way it came out, the fabric I was rendering is like a chiffon/organza so it folds in interesting ways 😹",2024-03-22 05:07:16
1bknw3n,"Ha! Interesting, I’ve personally never seen a hand like that before 🫣🩷",2024-03-22 19:21:14
1bknw3n,"I get what you’re saying about her fingers and nails - I intentionally drew them the way they are, I’ve drawn lots of classical and detailed life  drawings that were focused on realism - that’s not my goal for the piece. 🩵 

As for the cloth at the upper parts - it’s a separate piece of cloth she’s laying on that’s not connected to her dress. I literally referenced the exact garment and cloth the model wore when I drew this piece - it’s chiffon/organza - I went to FIT in NYC and have a degree in fashion design, I’m very familiar with how to render cloth and clothing. This isn’t a renaissance piece (as much as I love that era) and was not intended to be completely realistic as I said earlier. It’s fantasy - so leaving out seams in places where there would need to be ones in real life is okay for me being the artist, and also knowing how a garment is made and what kind of fabric it is. 

I do sincerely thank you for your feedback, I didn’t post this piece looking for any, and this isn’t art class and nobody is my teacher here, but I get that it’s the internet and that people are going to make suggestions about a subjective piece or work that they think is the “correct way.” 

Thank you for you kind words truly 🩷",2024-03-24 01:58:22

1bknw3n,"I’ve been doing it for about a year and I honestly enjoy it - I get to dress up, in lingerie and take self portraits, and also dance which are all hobbies of mine. I’ve always had an erotic side to me so it’s a nice outlet for it and it’s been good income consistently. I’ve even posted some of my artwork on there and a lot of my subscribers seemed to enjoy that. I’ve seen growth with it each month. If there’s any advice I would give to anyone starting out it would to stay true to yourself and your boundaries - there are so many people in this world and what makes you you and unique also makes you valuable and interesting to people. I was pleasantly surprised when first working on mine that the majority of my subscribers have been super respectful and sweet to work with. Some people test you but there always the block feature thankfully. I hope that helps!

19ehyfr,"I'm not gonna lie I've used the McDonald's deal for free 10pc nugget way too much... It makes it like $5 to get a large 10pc, fries, and a large drink 😵‍💫",2024-01-25 12:57:52
19ehyfr,"Americans are notoriously the fattest country—home of the Great McDonald’s—and our politics and global education rankings compared to the rest of the world make us look like clowns in a lot of ways.

I don’t really think it’s a joke so much as a ‘statement piece’.

The work is *beautifully* done, but I think it has more technical skill than anything with just… vague social commentary that’s been hashed to death since at least the 90’s.

Idk, that’s my take anyway. 🤷‍♂️",2024-01-25 04:20:08
19ehyfr,"*gets worked up over the imaginary internet points someone else has*

❄️",2024-01-25 03:04:08
19ehyfr,"I guess it’s all subjective, but… like the branding and processed foods are a pretty common and obvious critique of American culture.

It isn’t *wrong* but I don’t think there’s anything subtle at all. Big brands, corporate greed, consumerism, processed foods, it’s all bad for us, and it’s all a pretty common criticism we develop in our culture at like, the age of 15.

It’s almost *deliberately* obvious what the message is. Like maybe it’s supposed to even be dumbed down and face value *because we’re such dumb fat Americans.* 🙄

Again, it’s a *valid* criticism, but it’s like making art about cigarettes being bad for us. It’s just… pretty obvious. But it speaks in no way to the reasoning or motivation or the struggles of being engaged or imprisoned by the system that Capitalism has created.

It just says “There is a capitalist system in place and it is bad,” which is not a terribly deep nor nuanced opinion. I dunno. I’m from the US, so maybe this hits people in the rest of the world differently?

But I doubt it. Pretty much everyone in the world see us this way, including us. lol.",2024-01-24 20:43:24
