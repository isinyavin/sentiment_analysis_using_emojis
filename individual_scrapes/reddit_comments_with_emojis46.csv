hvoad6,"Germany imprisoning the gays after freeing them from concentration camps (minority groups were also hunted similar to jews), then never paying damaged to them cause all was ""legal"". Also our basic rights did not mention gays, cause then it would have been illegal to keep gays in prison. A phrase got reinterpreted later on to argue it's illegal. We still don't have gays mentioned. But the latest interpretations imply we are protected. 

To this day more conservative parties don't want this to be a talking point.


Have mentioned this more than once to some people. Many don't seem to know or the extent it went for. Though from what I read, few (2?) more groups also never got any repayment at all. But memory gets bad at this point 😅",2020-07-22 22:10:06

dlz9ej,"So funny story: my grandfather's brother was made a prisoner by the French army in Corsica, when, after about 8 months, he managed to escape and get to the mainland, Italy had ""switched sides"", but he knew  nothing about it. He had been hiding in inside a boat thanks to a Portoguese sailor he had bribed, who only spoke portoguese and spanish, so they didn't communciate much (apart from ""money, boat, livorno, not tell anyone, tonight"").
So, as soon as he entered the port, the first thing he did was to enter the nearest german posting being like ""yo bro, you see I ran away, so cool"". Well, he was arrested again. Not the most glorious soldier ever, I'll admit. 
Anyway, he was lucky enough to meet a german soldier he knew from before, so they played cards and got drunk toghether (while he's still tecnically a prisoner), and had a conversation more or less like this (In French):
My relative: ""So...I heard Hitler died...that sucks""
German soldier:""You know what? I really don't give a shit anymore, man, just let me come home already""
My relative: ""i get that""
War's over, they both go home (there's another interesting story about how he came home😂, if you want I can tell, but maybe I'm boring y'all); that German soldier (Hans) was a good friend of our family for 60+ years, until he passed about 7 years ago. I remember a couple times a year he would come to dinner either alone or with his wife and kids. And every time he and Ascanio would tell the story all over again, adding details every time (most of them made up, probably), and they would both laugh so hard that wine would come out of their nose.",2019-10-23 17:38:10

dlz9ej,"If you insist 😏....sooo, to understand the story, you need to know what a mes italy was in that period. Like, we are used to mess in italy, that's the only way we get stuff done, but that was a real mess. When italy ""switched sides"", some joined the Resistance trying to boycott German operations and became partisans, other genuine fascists ran away to the North were Mussolini was trying to put toghether the ""Repubblica di Salò"", and people like Ascanio, who had joined the war without enthusiasm, wandered blindly. Basically everybody in his family has been thinking he was dead for almost a year:he wasn't allowed to send letters in Corsica and he tired a couple times while in Livorno, but the mail was either blocked by the partisans or ended up not being delivered for some other reason. So, when some english-speaking Allies (Hans said they were British, Ascanio said they were American, and they always argued at that point of the story) arrived to the posting on their way northward, my relative was wearing a Nazi uniform (bc his uniform was full of lices and god knows what else, so they burned it and Hans gave him one), and he spoke 0 english. So, he was exchanged for a German, but he was fine with that bc the whole Hans's posting had surrendered and they were allowed to go home. That was easier said than done, since they had no cars or camions or horses or bike or whatever. They'll have to either walk for a couple weeks to get to Ascanio's house in Nortern italy, and at least a month to get to germany, or hopping on some train (they had some money for  food, not enough for a train ticket). They bought new clothes and started walking, north. A couple days later they came acorss a group of partisans celebrating, they were less organised then the Allies army, so you didn't really know what they'd do to Hans even if he surrendered, so (and here comes the part of the story I'm a but skeptic about), Ascanio made them believe he was his deaf-mute brother. Not kidding, that's what they'd say. Well, it worked, they got a free meal and continued their journey. 13 days later they reached Ascanio's sister house and they decided to both stop there bc it was too dangerous for Hans to cross the border while things were still settleing. They knock on the door.
""Who's there?""
""Your brother, coming back from hell!""
The door opens sligthly. A gun comes out. ""Do not fuck with me"".
Took some time to convince her it was him, at that point he was weighing about 55 kilos and hadn't showered in two weeks. When they eventually recognised him, hugs tears ecc..., clothes burning again (including nazi uniforms for safety). Hans stayed at their place for three months, Lidia got to like him when she realized he was so good with children (and he really had always been). And that's pretty much the whole story.",2019-10-23 18:46:50

So if I earn that much a month, which is above the average salary in Romania, I'm poor by default? I'd say you can live a decent life, and if you're smart with money, you can afford a lot of stuff even with that salary. Sure, if you want to buy a house by yourself, buy a car by yourself and go on an expensive vacation every year, you won't afford it with that money, but that's not poverty, it's bad decision making.

This mentality is why so many Romanians live paycheck to paycheck. I earn this much a month, but I want all of this and all of that, and a car, but not just any car, and a phone, but not just any phone, and a video game console, even though I play once a month.

There were several, but the three biggest ones were the following :

- as you said, portions. And food in general. What the hell is that? While there were some l places where I ate well (especially seafood places), the food was so processed.... It really messed up my stomach. And the breakfasts.... Sausages and syrupy pancakes on the same plate? No thanks. The fast food is awful too, compared to Europe, even the same franchise can be really different.

- how easily people said something homophobic to me, someone they did not know or had ever seen before. (and to clarify, I am a woman travelling with my husband) This happened about 3 times. All of them, it came completely out of left field. Something crass but relatively minor, like ""haha I bet gays don't be too worry about expensive dates"" (in context, meaning gay people were easy). I was buying cigars and taking about how London was so expensive, where the hell did that come from?

I have never encountered a missing seat in the US, and I've been to almost every state.

I don't know why our stalls have the gap. It's something that I grew up with, so of course I never questioned it. I always thought it had to do with being easier to mop the floor, but I don't know.

I've been to my share of nasty restrooms here and across the pond, I don't think paying guarantees a clean bathroom. Big cities, tourist areas are bound to have heavy traffic, and be harder to keep clean, as are those is out of the way places that get little traffic and may be neglected.

1. Because of dialects people from North could not Understand people from South (not always).
2. On Sundays every store is closed.

We would probably say something like ""I'm happy to be born in Germany/glad to be German."" but I and many Germans don't think the concept of pride fits with something that no one has really worked for/accomplished.

ijaz05,"I am 21 year old gay man and I lived in Poland my whole life. I don’t feel threatened by my existence. Being gay is not illegal (*yet* 😉). All of my friends know that I’m gay and were extremely supportive when I came out to them. Even that one right-wing friend was chill. I don’t like how the government treats my fellow LGBT people but they orchestrated that war themselves. They needed a scapegoat again and this time it was us unfortunately. What they didn’t expect though was that we would retaliate. 

Being gay in Poland isn’t ideal. In bigger cities in the western part of the country such as Warsaw, Poznań, Szczecin, Wrocław being gay is easier and people there are usually very tolerant and supportive, on par with local governments. Steps begin when you are from some rural parts in the south east where they are very religious and closed-minded. 

We can’t have civil unions, adopt children. Other discrimination is technically illegal. 

What rubs me the wrong way though is that since the government started a war with us, more and more bigots feel entitled to voice they homophobic views.

I’m personally think that change is coming though. I call our current situation as “Delayed Sexual Revolution”. Our voices are finally being heard. No other government since 1990 did anything to help our situation. The fact that there is a public debate here makes me hopeful. There are countries in the EU were public support of the LGBT community is even lower than here. 

The “LGBT ideology” that they are screaming about is just a buzz word to unite people against us. The government is all pro traditional family model so introducing same sex union means their pro-family politics wouldn’t mean anything in their minds. 

As I said, being gay in Poland is not perfect by any means but it’s also not the worst. I enjoy life to the fullest, I have fun, I have supportive friends. I just simply don’t have time for bigots and negativity. Being gay doesn’t define me as a person and I cannot let people degrade me to only sexuality. 

Also, anti-LGBT policies don’t affect my life because there aren’t any. The president said he wants to propose a constitutional change so adopting children by LGBT people would be illegal. But he would need a 2/3 of the lower house for that and PIS doesn’t have that even with all their right wing allies and Senate is 51% opposition so no way of it happening in either way.

Also the whole fake “LGBT ideology” that they are saying will destroy Polish families... idk. 
I’m not lgbt but my friend was called names just because she had rainbow bag so I guess the hatred is real but they are trying to justify it by differentiating gay people and LGBT (lmao). So they would say that they have nothing against gay people but LGBT ideology is there to ruin Poland and the rainbow flag is it’s symbol. 🙄
There is also huge discussion whether said flag is offensive towards Catholics and when Papa Francis tweeted that the cross doesn’t need protection, radicals were saying that he is not their Papa anymore lol
Also people started to boycott the Żywiec beer because it promoted a concert during which a rainbow flag was displayed. 

So really, it’s mostly about the symbols I guess, but some people really treat it as the enemy that they have to protect their children from. Obviously tho it’s just a replacement theme so we don’t talk about all the frauds in the government and real issues.",2020-08-30 13:19:43

ijaz05,"how about we take a different look at our people, poland went trough both communism and fascism yet people seem to connect anything left wing to communism including lgbt (i've seen such people), most of their arguments is that they will never vote for somebody who supports lgbt as they dont want PRL to come back, and just like that we have a party which is stupid right, like literally stereotypical right wing which breaks the law all the time and does pretty much what they want, some people think thats okay and ""at least its not communism"" yeah but keep going that way and we'll end up fascist which at least imo would be worse than communism. Now about my views, i dont like when people put words into my mouth, i gave you several reasons why i dislike patriotic people, the fact that they put their nationality everywhere where they can is just annoying and unnecessary, im sure i could be friends with a patriotic person if they werent so agressive online. Have you ever watched a youtube video with a slight reference to poland and went to the comments and they were all filled with 🇵🇱 or ""*insert time* ITS POLAND, IM POLISH AND I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY SAID"" thats pretty much spam, i dont go to the comments to check how many of them are polish, i go to the comments to see if someone maybe gave a link to the song from the video, has somme questions about it, got somehow lost, but with all that polish spam i cannot find anything and i'd have to scroll for hours. Summing it up, if somebody can controll themselves there is no reason for me to insult them",2020-08-31 09:30:45

Sorry, I don't use it. And I hate racism but quite a few South Koreans often say ""looks like Chinese"" when they see someone who does cheat or is lazy, tacky or even dirty.. And they are often jokingly referred to as ""Nakamura"" people who are short, have a curved upper body, have tiny mustaches, have protruding front teeth, have stiff teeth, or have uneven teeth. Also they often refer to people with relatively dark skin and slender bodies as ""Southeast Asians."".. I really hate to create stereotypes and prejudices about appearance characteristics such as race, ethnicity, and skin color in this way.

No, 'cause I'm the person who speaks things that aren't understandable in Turkish and English among my friendship pool/zone. 

However; in Bulgarian and German, I feel this 😂 Maybe it's because I found learning Bulgarian too hard and I am out of practice in German after 10th grade (Shortly, it's been 3 years) since we started to have extra Math or Physics lessons instead of actual German lessons; then last year, well... college. I decided to take courses to learn German and then emigrate from Turkey (y'know, political and economical reasons), but then the Covid-19 outbreak happened. 

I'll try to learn either German, French or Finnish fluently. I wish I could learn Korean too to meet my favourite YouTuber/Cat butler ever and have an autograph from her maybe, or/and live in a work-disciplined country I've been longing to live, but learning a new and unrelated to Latin alphabet would pose a serious challenge for keeping my med school grades as highest and balanced (e.g.: not getting 100 from one and 70 from another but getting 85 from both instead) as possible.",2020-08-11 11:27:53

hg701x,"As an Indian these are some of my tips .. 

1) Best way to keep room kool is to deprive of it sunlight while keeping it ventilated... I know this sounds antithetical to what many people do but it’s good to fully use them curtains. 

2) Electronic gadget like a big ass portable fan for a room for sleeping at night. As long as it is able to cover the the range of you sleeping bed. I genuinely don’t see alternatives here. Normally I would recommend ACs but they are pretty much wasteful spending given that it’s literally only a month. 

4) Now this is the most important part. When temperatures are beyond 35 degrees, don’t go sunbathing at noon time or something. In fact keeping your self covered with light breathable cotton is often ideal. In fact you should avoid venturing out in peak daytime too much or you will get heat related exhaustion So while it’s very very tempting to go naked/nude when it’s 40 degrees out there, don’t ! You will get a nasty sunburn. Even people with higher melanin don’t do this ... I wish I told this to more people ( German police has a field time arresting some random dude who goes out naked... and the semi nudists come out of hiding in plenty during summer) 

4) Lots of water and keeping water bottles in fridge 

5) This advice maybe quite difficult for some but dial down on the red meat ! Those are extremely Heath and Make you unnecessarily fatigued. Fruits and fish should be preferred over. Meat is best had in the night. 

6) Go to air conditioned spaces like libraries/malls and spend hours indoors at those places 😉😉😉 ( Due to corona it’s not possible unfortunately)

p.s ... if you really can’t use gadgets or do the above , then just wet your hair... this is not ideal but anything is better",2020-06-26 22:18:24

gwk5pt,"It depends who you ask. Sorry if this might get long, but it's a very gray area. 

To start, the sovereign state is the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Within that kingdom there are 4 countries, Aruba, Curaçao, the Netherlands and Sint Maarten. We also have 3 islands who are Dutch municipalities, Bonaire, Saba and Statia. 

 On paper, everyone within the Kingdom has Dutch nationality. This is not the same as being culturally Dutch though as all of the different islands have their own unique cultures. 

Now when it comes to sentimentality, it depends who you ask. Most simply refer to themselves as Aruban as that's the country we were born in. Alongside that the people who travel a lot have at least the recognition/appreciation of having the Dutch nationality because that's what you have to say or write down when it comes up. 

You also have the people(like myself) who travel back and forth between the islands and the Netherlands. Students, business travelers, family visits etc. These people while feeling Aruban also may feel a connection to the Netherlands itself because they've either lived there for an extended period of time, have family members there or their families are originally Dutch themselves. Many Arubans have a Dutch parent, grandparent or great grandparent. 



Lastly, you also have people who don't have any type of contact with the Netherlands. This can be due to having no Dutch speaking family members/friends or because they never needed to travel to NL(students can also choose the University of Aruba, Latin America or the US/Canada for their studies). If someone has no direct contact with the Netherlands, almost never has to use Dutch, it's possible that the nationality and our connection to NL would be nothing more than a formality to them.

Edit:

When Europeans started colonizing what is now the USA and Canada, there were over 570 different distinct Native tribes, each of which had their own language or dialect. Very few had written languages.

So, the European colonists tried to spell the local Native name phonetically in their own language, be that English, French, Dutch, or Spanish. It worked as well as this:

chk47m,"Most European countries have public health care, that includes mental health care too 🖖🏿",2019-07-25 08:48:06
chk47m,"I haven’t read through all of these comments, but as an American I’ll make a few guesses.  I think there are more people in this country with problems (causing them to act crazy) for the following reasons:
1. People want attention.  If you happen to do just the right crazy thing and someone gets it on their cellphone, wham, you could go viral.  Wanting to go viral is a big thing for (usually) younger folks and kids in America (maybe I’m wrong here.  Are many Europeans obsessed with “going viral” too?)
2. Crazy work hours, lack of decent paid vacation or sick time (recently watched a documentary called “Zero Weeks” that states that 1 out of 4 American mothers return to work within TEN days of giving birth.  TEN DAYS!  I didn’t check their sources, but u can find this doc and it’s sooo depressing), crazy health care costs (recent news article, man found out he had kidney failure, after 14 weeks of dialysis his insurance paid about $16,000 of it and he got a bill for over $500,000, you can google this), wages not keeping up with inflation.  This leaves people constantly exhausted and on edge.   Bottom line: STRESS.
3. Equating a person’s worth with their economic contribution, meaning if you are poor you are more likely to be treated like you aren’t worth the air you breathe because “you’re using my tax dollars to sit on your lazy ass.”  Even though most of these people truly need help.  Again, leads to anxiety, depression, and the slippery slope into psychosis in extreme cases. And of course there’s the whole fear of the US prison system which disproportionately incarcerates minorities and the poor. = Stress
4. The general craziness of the US government at this time.  All the uncertainty and hate that trump spews gives the US population a general feeling of either anxiety (more likely left wing, but all ppl
can certainly be affected), or aggressive entitlement (more likely right wingers wanting to bust out their guns and march every brown person to the southern border and kick their ass back into Mexico, who they feel should figure out what to do with them, but of course there are left wingers feeling entitled to harass folks wearing maga apparel).
5. The lack of empathy noted in number 3, along with electronics (think FB, texting, Reddit 😉❤️[I’m guilty]), which means that less ppl have solid family and friend support networks, which often coincides with/contributes to mental illness, which is too likely to be dealt with through self medication with drugs (opiates are the current craze, before that it was meth, and of course you’ve always got coke, crack, and a bunch of new drugs I don’t even understand like spice or whatever drug was causing ppl to eat ppl’s faces off...umm, bath salts?)
4. Again back to #3, America all to often values capitalism (I.e. mostly old white men (corporations) getting rich using any ruthless tactic or law loophole they can find, all at the expense of the general public. 

These are just a few of the things that I believe are wrong with America and make people more likely to be mentally or emotionally unstable, or maybe just act strangely for attention.  Shit, they prob figure that if our president can act like a lunatic daily on the world stage, they might see it as normalized (omg, the reality of this is frightening when u think of it in terms of how the behavior of our future leaders could be affected. God help us.). Some of you may disagree, that’s cool.  And maybe none of these reasons are why Americans act crazy in public.  Maybe they all just want to be cooler, newer, fresher.  I guess it depends what the crazy behavior is. My list has mostly been based on crazy as in someone talking to themselves on the bus rather than cutting your hair into a tall blue Mohawk, piercing and tattooing your face everywhere, and playing some obscure instrument on the street corner. (Disclaimer, I’m a fan of tats and piercing, and to each their own, but I personally couldn’t take it as far as some ppl do). I don’t know.  🤷🏻‍♀️ As much as I’d like to think that America is doing great right now, the truth is it’s fucking sucks.  And trump says if ppl don’t like America then they can leave.  Fuck him.  We will stay and FIX all the shit he is fucking up. It’s just too bad that our kids will still be picking yo the pieces for decades. There, end of rant.",2019-07-26 13:24:51

gq1awm,"Israel's constitution is actually a series of basic laws, each being a different chapter of the final Constitution they're all supposed to be consolidated into sometime soon™.

The one which will become the first chapter is the infamous Nation-State basic law:

> **1. Basic Principles**
>
> (a) The land of Israel is the historical homeland of the Jewish people, in which the State of Israel was established.
>
> (b) The State of Israel is the national home of the Jewish people, in which it fulfills its natural, cultural, religious, and historical right to self-determination.
>
> (c) The right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.

The Nation State basic law is literally ripped straight off a draft constitution written by a far-right NGO. And I would have preferred using the Israeli Democracy Institute's ""Constitutiton by Consensus"" proposal much more. *That* proposal's first article reads:

> **1. Basic Principles**
>
> (a) The State shall be called ""Israel"".
>
> (b) Israel shall be a Jewish and democratic state.
>
> (c) The State shall act with equality towards all its citizens.
>
> (d) The system of government shall be a parliamentary democracy.

I even outlined my ""ideal"" version of the Nation-State law, with ""Constitutiton by Consensus"" elements injected in:

> **1. Basic Principles**
>
> (a) The land of Israel is the historical homeland of the Jewish people, in which the State of Israel was established.
>
> (b) The State of Israel is the national home of the Jewish people, in which it fulfills its natural, cultural, religious, and historical right to self-determination.
>
> *(b1) Israel shall be a Jewish and democratic state.*
>
> (c) The right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is *not* unique to the Jewish people.

> *(c) The State shall act with equality towards all its citizens.*

We had spent one month in Tromsø working in a farm we contacted through workaway (amazing experience btw, highly suggested), then we took one more week to travel southbound by train, stopping here and there, and get the plane from Oslo. To save time and money we decided to travel by night. We were on a train from Trondheim to Bergen, but it was just impossible to sleep, at least for me, the seats were too unconfortable and it was too crowded; my friend instead had crawled under the table between the seats and fallen asleep there, using her backpack as a pillow. I don't know how she does that. Anyway around 4 am, i was super tired but i still couldn't sleep and the guy next to me decided it wad the right time for a conversation, he started asking me where i came from how long i had been in norway and so on. My very sleepy answer was something like ""we were in the north...we worked so they gave us food...we went away early...now we are trying to go south..."". The guy looked at me with big pity eyes and went ""Oh...is she your little sister?"" Pointing at my friend. (We are the same age btw, but she is a bit petit and crawled up like that she looked a bit like a child). I was like ""No, she is my friend"", a bit weirded out, but i was too tired to realise the misunderstanding. I eventually fell asleep, when i woke up maybe one hour later, it was our stop. As we were getting off the train the guy reached into his luggage and handed me a blanket and some dry meat: ""Good luck"" he said.

n8z622,"Norway has 15 weeks of paid parental leave for both parents. Each parent has their own 15 week  period in which they can receive benefits and stay home- if they choose to work instead they lose the sum for those 15 weeks; so either can choose to work if the other wants to stay home extra...but must make that decision for the whole 15 weeks ahead of time.

When it is the mother’s turn, only she can receive benefits for the childcare and vice versus when it is supposed to be the fathers turn. Thus ensuring equality in the raising of children 👨🏻‍🍼👩🏻‍🍼☺️",2021-05-10 09:01:57

80 days! Fully paid! And it is not deducted from your annual holiday leave (which we also have a lot... in banking it is 35 days). It is absolutely insane and I have never heard of anything like it.

g3wsq6,"Partially, like I said in the original, we already tried and failed miserably. As for why, it has more to do with the fact that it’s extremely tedious and expensive.

Just on the roads alone, you’ll have to redo 4 million miles... 6.5 million km worth of repainting/designing signs across a 3.8 million square mile... er 9.8 total square km. With that said, having everything digitalized, it does make it easier that it was back in the 1970s when we 1st attempted to.

But personally, it doesn’t make that much sense to move over. The general consensus for moving over seems to be everyone else is using it, which doesn’t sound like a good argument, tbh. I don’t mind using metric, nor am I trying to be combative about switching as if it’s all that important to me (hope I didn’t come across that way). At most it’s a minor inconvenience. Calculators and apps exist for a reason. But it’s just like saying you need to drive a Prius instead of a Audi because everyone in your family owns a Prius.

Even small businesses have to apply taxes, so it's not that right know they don't know which jurisdiction/tax is applied. They would just need to do it once for all their products instead of thousands of times for few products at time...


It's true that for big supermarkets it would be easier, maybe even with digital price tags, but I don't really see the big difficulty for small shops... They know the price without taxes, they know the taxes for that products (because they still need to apply them when someone buys it), what's the difficulty in printing the price with taxes when you put the item on the shelf?


And mine is really not a critical comment, is just that I don't really see these logistical difficulties that have been mentioned 😅",2020-04-19 06:43:24

j6n7do,"Thanks a lot! It feels like I was listening to a 1-hour Nothern Europe history lecture from you.😅 I think the part that the history of Korea and Japan shares more than the history of Korea and China is much bigger. In terms of linguistics, in fact, Chinese itself has little to do with Korean. Chinese is more closely related to Tibetan. Usually Japanese scholars say that Japanese is derived from ancient Korean(especially Nothern Korean). Probably speaking of an interesting history of Korea and China that you do not know, the founder of the Qing Dynasty, China's last dynasty, was from Korea. He was from the southeastern part of South Korea now. So, the Qing Dynasty historically believed that Korea was the land of their ancestors. Ironically, however, Koreans and Korean dynasty at the time despised the Qing dynasty and its people as barbarians, so the Korean dynasty had to fight incredibly hard with the Qing dynasty. Perhaps you don't know, but there are a lot of Chinese people who don't recognize the Qing dynasty as their own history. As I said, the Qing dynasty was founded by a different tribe  than the Chinese people of today. The Qing people used to treat the Chinese as their serfs. Well, Perhaps you don't even know that the Japanese royal family is of Korean descent. That's why Japanese ultra-nationalists don't like Japanese King and royal families.🌚",2020-10-07 10:34:05

j6n7do,"Are you half-Korean?👀 That's interesting! I think Your knowledge is good enough unless you have had a formal education in the history of Korea and East Asia. Because I know that Westerners and Europeans are very indifferent to Asia and Asian history in usual.👻 Yeah, By lineage, Manchurians are the closest relatives of Koreans. In terms of DNA, the closest people to Koreans are the Manchus and the Japanese. Manchuria was the territory of Korea (Koguryo). The name Korea itself has its roots in Koguryo. Balhae, the descendant of Koguryo, ruled Manchuria. Also, Balhae was a multi-ethnic country where Koreans were the ruling class and Manchus were the dominated class. Later, after the fall of Balhae, they moved to Japan and became aristocrats.🐻 Sadly, after the 20th century, the Manchus have already lost their own language, alphabet, and history. There are even more major researchers and authors of the Manchu language in South Korea or Japan. They have already been brainwashed with Chinese-style communist education, forgot their identity as Manchurians and believe they are Chinese.🌚 There are quite a few Manchus among Chinese migrants in South Korea, but they say they are Chinese and not they are Manchus..",2020-10-07 22:40:55

gfnqlf,"One month of holiday season in December with Christmas markets (mulled wine and Schmalzkuchen 😋), Advent Calendars, Nicolaus fest, many lights in the streets, presents. Also, I'm a fan of medieval Christmas markets 😍. They have fires, fire shows and handmade stuff. 
Personally, I use a lot of warm, indirect lights in my home during winter time. 
Like nice little light chains, tons of candles, lamps for fragrance oils. Then of course you have cookie baking marathons with your SO and/or colleagues and friends. Actually, I quiet like the season.
The most depressing months for me are January, followed by February and November.",2020-05-08 08:23:21
gfnqlf,"Honestly, November is really bad. It just get's darker and darker with no end in sight, but you still have some of that sun energy™ from October left, so you do alright. Then December comes and Christmas season, which is great bc there's lights everywhere, but it also get's dark so early and winter depression really starts to hit. But at least a day before Christmas you have another day to look forward to, winter solstice. And after that the days get longer, and it's still shitty but you know it gets better so that does a lot of good. January still is pretty dark and miserable, but at least there's snow sometimes. And then towards the end of February things slowly start to grow again and you get the first days with that ""spring is coming"" feeling, where the sun is shining and it's warm enough so you don't need a jacket. And then winter is over and spring comes and there's birds and everything is growing and it's warm but not too hot and everything is just great!

But yeah, living in central Germany winter depression hits hard sometimes. I have no idea how I would handle only one or two hours of daylight a day, or even days without any.",2020-05-08 10:07:54
gfnqlf,"Dear Melbourner,

I understand completely what you're talking and suffering about.

I know from my own  experience how much sunlight or not sunlight can affect the quality feeling of our life. 

Probabely I can assist you in your wish or deep need  of well beeing although you are missing the long sunlight.

 A couple of years ago I find a solution by 4 arguments which help me very much to defend against or more avoid the autumdepression how some people call this circumstance of missing the sunlight so very much that you get negative emotions without knowing from what reason exactly they arise.

1. fact that if the leaves fall down to earth so they can't produce oxygen any longer.   
Leaves of trees do that normally at night.
If you have lots of trees which loose their leaves the oxygen level in the air differs and should get lower.
May that's reason No1 your body reacts therefore beside your mind.

2.  Microorganisms you can say eat the leaves and need oxygen for this process. A double lack of oxygen comparing with the summer times.

 3. If you are a nature and creature loving individual may be you catch the sufferingof some animals or the trees themselves go through facing winter time is coming up and loss of living power by less sunlight likewise to you.

4. One winter I experienced during that warm winter season a lot of flowers did not stop to show their colourful skirts. The following spring I remarked I could not feel the great happiness as usual. 

To me in total all these options of reasons to my subconciousnes are enough to calm me down from suffering too much and say to myself as a filter, that's equal which of these chooses your body let feel inconvenient. Fact is, body talks always and mostly we are used to say: don't listen to you...but sometimes the body speech takes the rule and dictates the mind.

I  believe though you are a person who loves nature very much aswell you are a very empathic character.

I wish the very best for you during the absence of sunlight. We in Germany face now upcoming summer. 
When in subject Geography at school our teacher explained the invest seasons in order to the position to the Equatorial planet circle I remember as if it was yesterday
..I could hardly believe or imagine..that at the same time 2 opposite situation might taking place.
After we learned more and more about differing living environments at one point my mind said to me: enough, I can't imagine any more these hundreds of parallel differing and often sad realities....

Now with covid19 as a chance to face exactly again the big differences of living standards I see the real good chance of more help to one prosperity standard.. no more dying of hunger, everybody a roof over the head, some social empathic contacts, 1 option more to get earns or little business and millions of answers on fan's in open sources...so that free learning can help us to a communication standard to avoid big misunderstanding first of all.

Dear Melbourne's,
I found a method of a basic satisfaction self coaching option. To be satisfied even something like you feel is coming up. It is not a method of coping it is more a method of getting aware who you are and what are your claims. It is an individual way to get sensibelized yourself for the area of options to commit with the decision or wish to live in a kind of status of satisfaction.

Key is
1. There are a lot of layer of satisfaction similar to the term ""intelligence"". We know about the differencation for some years very well. We know the maths intelligence, or general logical intelligence...the social...the artists...or role play...or perfectionist....or behaviour...or body talk...(...)
T .makes sence to adapt this example as a template you could say to the bed feeling scenery....though you might find out your self the source why you miss the sun the most or deepest...inside...next if you say...the sun missing makes me unable to feel satisfied...than you can start distinguishing your individual satisfaction facts.

There are the social roles...your work...hobby...your highest interests aswell as your deep needs.

If interested in more about my method of ifbases satisfaction or I say to it shortly idsi...individual....daily satisfaction...index..

Pplease let me know.

To explain all in detail is the wrong place here...

I hope I could give you a nice inspiration.

I'm planning lots of self managing self coaching groups. 
You are not at all alone with this missing sunlight effect....

You can refer to me more often if it will help you to talk about it....together we are always stronger...
Our next autumn in Germany and winter I will probabely have a need to talk to you...😉😊😎

Wishing well

NYC right now but previously, Cologne, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, London, Paris and Tel Aviv are places I've worked for at least a year. Enough to understand a bit about the respective national economies. And if I were to launch a new start-up, I wouldn't start in Germany. It's a very inflexible country. Just from personal experience, having done consultancy out of my company across multiple nations, it were the Germans who were extremely unnecessarily difficult with their interpretation of rules, regulations and especially tax law - under the same EU regulations that applied to all other EU countries where I've provided the same services. But also talking to local guys running a food truck it was clear that they felt the German system as heavy on regulations and checks. A food truck slinging burgers is the same no matter where you go. The rules under which you operate are different owe country and or city though. Or paying by card: impossible. Cash only culture largely. Which sucks if you spend in pound sterling from a business account and need to account for these expenses in euro's later. Digital/card payments fix that as my bookkeeping software tracks this. Unless you paid cash. The Germans are not very flexible in showing any understanding that you might have reasons as to why you don't want to pay cash. Ticket machine in tram out of service? Still get a fine: somehow it's a ""my problem"" when on a tram without a valid ticket. Nevermind the fact the ticket machine is located in the tram thus you need to board before you can buy (if the machine would be working). A simple question (in German, yes I speak my languages more or less) as to ""what would you have done yourself?"" to the chap in uniform writing me a ticket was answered with ""get off and walk"". From a moving tram, with doors closed? It seemed an entirely reasonable answer to him. This simply would not happen in the UK or NL. Checking in hotels: they charge ""tourism tax"" well guess what, I'm here on behalf of my own company to work. I'm not a tourist and under your own regulations that means I'm exempt from tourist tax. ""Can you prove this?"" Excuse me, is this a tribunal? I'm paying with a business credit card isn't that enough? No I need to sign a form. Fine I'll sign your bloody form ""do you have a company stamp?"" A what? This is 2019 I'm not walking around with company stamps or wax to seal envelopes as if it were the 1600s, are you mad? We have email! ""Okay but this is against our regulations"" well I'm terribly sorry but that for once happens to be not a ""my problem"" Or more culturally... the fact that there's hardly any craft beer. there's craft beer all over the world these days, from San Diego to Las Palmas to Bangkok. But in Germany it's not ""beer"" apparently. Ok whatever. The list goes on.
Don't get me wrong, I liked working in Germany for a myriad of other reasons and I'd do it again. But not because it was very flexible - the opposite 😂",2021-03-04 15:04:05

ggf3no,"I once accidentally invaded Croatia.

A friend and I were on a kayak exped from Germany to the Black Sea via the Danube and having gone through Hungary we came to the Serbian and Croatian borders. I saw a cool monument on the horizon so I convinced my mate we should go on land to check it out. 

No sooner had we touched down on the Croatian bank a great big police van pulled up and two burly Croats came abounding over. “Dobre den” I said friendlily. “Passport”, came the stern reply. They took our docs and they asked in Croatian where we had come from etc. And I managed to convey what I could. He mimed ‘pay a fine’ or ‘jail’. I said point blank that there was no way we would pay a fine or go to jail (risky move there). I explained that my mate had had to take a leak (which he did and was doing so when they came over) and explained the complexities of pissing out of a moving kayak, hence our landfall. For some reason this eventually convinced them to let us off the hook. Maybe because the fuss kicked up. We got off scot free and headed over the river to Serbia.

Both South Korea and Japan are among the world's poorest English-speaking countries, while spending the most budget on Public English education. Well, I think there are two main reasons for this. First, Korean sentence structures (and Japanese) is the opposite of English sentence structures. And the second reason is that South Korea is culturally and ethnically disconnected from the outside, It's too homogeneous and our economy is not based on tourism, unlike other Asian countries (eg Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia etc). So learning English is not very relevant to our survival but getting good test results. Btw, Chinese and English have the same sentence structures.

For example tomato sauce IS made with OLIVE OIL...though i've Heard of a polish Guy that uses butter 😟. The thing IS that our food tastes to olive oil and yours to butter. And that's that.
      
Then there's limits, for example butter Burns easily because It's rich in proteins. If you want those proteins then butter IS mandatory (making buttermilk, for examole). if you don't want them you can use oil or simply clarify the butter...in the end it comes down to taste. And butter has a very distinctive taste. As do ""unrefined"" oils. For example in shichuanese cuisine the norm IS unrefined rapeseed oil, which apparently has a mustardy flavour.

Perhaps being on the same continent is essentially it. The rest of the world views us as such but only to a certain degree.
No one in Europe wants to have less of themselves and more of the other European countries cultures.

France is perhaps the best example. They consider themselves superior to and will stop at nothing to remain in the center of power, despite them constantly failing at productive reforms. French is by no means a common language, nor is it wide in its cultural reach (unlike fx Germany). Their economy is big, but shrinking, but somehow they have diplomatic sway like almost no other. Their hardcore reluctance in accepting Germany as the center of the European economy is a great example.
This is truly not to bash France, but its an insurmountable obstacle in order to function as a federation in the true sense of the word.

We also have so many klicks, The Nordic Countries, Benelux, GerAusSwitz, Balkan, the former Chechoslowakia, The Med countries, Vicegrad, The Baltic, etc. We have many friends, even brothers and sisters within those groups but there is still a BIG difference between fx Denmark and Greece.🇩🇰❤️🇬🇷

Even horrible things brought us together, things like wars, like the Crusades, all of the endless list of wars between ourselves, especially the world wars.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural-Altaic
>The term continues to be used for the central Eurasian typological, grammatical and lexical convergence zone.[5] Indeed, ""Ural-Altaic"" may be preferable to ""Altaic"" in this sense. For example, J. Janhunen states that ""speaking of 'Altaic' instead of 'Ural-Altaic' is a misconception, for there are no areal or typological features that are specific to 'Altaic' without Uralic.

I'm learning Japanese currently, and the amount of similarish words is really intriguing. And the similar words are not modern, they're basic words like ""morning"", ""night"", ""winter"", ""summer"", ""war"", ""sky/heaven"", ""stone"", ""body"", ""back"", ""eye"" etc.  Or take this sentence for example:

🇯🇵 *Sono yoru, bokuno heyani neta. Sensou ya tatakaino oto ga kiita, kankeinaku kireino yume o mita.*

🇫🇮 *Sinä yönä, minun huoneessani nukuin. Sodan ja taistelun äänet kuulin, kuitenkin kauniin unen näin.*

It just makes it uglier.

Your description sounds fine, actually. Example: Ukraine 🇺🇦, blue for the skies, yellow for the wheat and sunflowers. Great, moving on.

Plus, it makes it much more recognizable. A flag should have symbolism, but it doesn't have to be a history lesson.

As is, if you look at it for 3 seconds and want to draw it it's: red, green, squibly lines in the middle. 

To the point, see how it looks if it's small: 🇵🇹. You don't really see anything but squibles, except for red and green. Flags should be able to be reproduced in a small form, as they are often far away or in the wind.

While the portuguese flag is still recognizable because the red green scheme, veritcally separated as such is not so common, the squigly middle doesn't contibute much towards that.

It was recently uncovered that the Norwegian Police Academy has for years had a sketchy party culture with something they unofficially named Knulletorsdag, or Fuck-Thursday, among their students and instructors. People have been paying with sex for favours and better grades.

So now everyone's going around making jokes and using the term in relation to Thursday. And as you can guess the police's social media accounts have really been getting hit lately, with people making memes, photoshops and videos about Fuck-Thursday.

[Like this TikTok (gif link). Yes, our police force has a damn TikTok account.](https://imgur.com/a/rV9g6k4)

When someone’s calling a girl cute: really depends on the tone, can be positive but sometimes there is the undertone that it means naive/“too innocent” to get something

Where I live it is like the slices of a pie. 10:15 is Viertel elf (Quarter eleven) 10:30 is Half eleven, 10:45 is three quarters eleven.

In other places it is quarter past ten, half eleven, quarter before/to eleven.

In other areas there is even different forms like Quarter over ten (Viertel über zehn)

So going from region to region you can confuse people quite a bit if they are not used to interact in the multiple forms of time announcement.

Another stark divide in Austria and Germany is the use of different decks of cards for the most popular card games and what those games are.

The divide is between those who play with German suited cards (Hearts, bells, acorns, leaves) and those who play with traditional 'French' cards (♦️♠️ ❤️ clubs). In Austria it is mainly Vienna+surrounding areas which plays French vs. everybody else. The time thing also overlaps with the card divide.",2021-04-26 07:15:05

g3knbj,"Oh yeah! Not as many badly executed projects as not executed at all for years/decades because of political squabbles. That applies to most of our unfinished highways, a new train station for Brno, any high speed railways, P+R systems, metro/railway connection to the Prague airport (currently, your only options are buses and taxis, and that's a pretty big airport),... We always have something like this going on. Sometimes there are environmental activists delaying the construction of a highway, for example, sometimes it's just an excuse from incompetent politicians.

Now things that were badly executed: the introduction of electronic public transport passes in Prague (""Opencard"") was known as a giant overpriced scam, they have since been replaced by a different provider. Then there was the ""toll gate controversy"", revolving around the government singing very disadvantageous deals with the private company that was going to administer a new automated system of collecting highway tolls from trucks. 

All the way back in the 90s, we had ""Internet for schools"", a similar scam involving famously overpriced IT equipment for public schools. And while we're on the topic of schools - ""státní maturita"", an attempt to standardize high school final exams, started in 2012 and has been quite a mess ever since. The number and selection of subjects have changed, test difficulty is always criticized as too low and too high at the same time, and ministers of education flip flop on the inclusion of a mandatory maths exam almost every year.

When I use the map, I prefer getting oral directions. However, if you have the phone set to English, it completely mangles up the Spanish names to a ludicrous degree.

Since, once again, I prefer hearing instructions then reading them (in a high speed metal casket!), and spending time deciphering what the hell the assistant said is a good way to miss your exit, as we say in Spanish: blanco y en botella, I set the phone to Spanish.

As for why Siri in Spanish: consistency; though it does lead to facepalm moments with my laptop, as it’s still in English, but Siri’s language is synchronized everywhere, so.... yeah.

Also-also, since my phone is essentially an extension of my mind, I find myself thinking more in Spanish, which I find peculiar 🤷🏽‍♂️",2018-12-04 19:54:49
fuq9mz,"I think it has some minuses, though. First, the technical aspect has some problems; sometimes the game bugs. Also the combat system becomes uncomfortable when fighting multiple enemies. Finally, in the second part of the game it becomes too easy - you kill almost everyone with 2-3 hits. There are some op perks that kinda break the immersion (for example, the perk that allows you not to get hungry and tired unless you move. It literally makes the atmosphere of realism a little interrupted).

However, everything else is amazing: there are plenty of cool side quests, the visual style of landscape, models of characters, armour, etc. are excellent; despite being uncomfortable when fighting multiple enemies, the combat system is great in duels. 

I learned a lot of things about middle-ages Czechia while playing it 😅

Even though I haven't finished the game, I'm waiting for a sequel already. I hope it will fix things that I didn't like and make things I liked even better. One thing is for certain - KCD is a unique game and I will certainly remember this experience.

I have just finished the monastery mission. 

P.S. I also found it strange when I learned that there is no Czech localisation, to be honest. Though sometimes they play songs in Czech on the background it cutscenes",2020-04-05 09:31:48
m18tq8,"Before I even start, I just want to open by saying that I feel so much gratitude to be living in Europe in this day and age, when we look at each other as the same people, as **Europeans,** and not as the rivals our forefathers looked at each other.

# Dear Slovakia & Romania

I would love nothing more than for all 3 of us to stop whining about what we did to each other 100 years ago, and move forward and actually treat each other like fellow Europeans.

# Dear Croatia

To say the least, historically our treatment of Croats might not have been the best, but I want all the Croats of r/AskEurope to know that I absolutely love your country, and your coastal cities are the best places for any Hungarian to spend a summer holiday in. I swear to God it's cheaper than going to the Balaton sometimes.

# Dear Austria

Of all our neighbours, you guys are the most civilized, and frankly, the most European. You are the country Hungary wishes to be, and the country Hungarians wish to live in. It's not a coincidence that Austria is Hungary's only neighbour whose Hungarian minority is constantly growing.

# Dear Poland

The saying ""Polak, weiger dwa bratanki"" has been true all throughout history, and it is true even today. As of today, we are struggling together under a pathetic excuse of a government, and I can only hope that we can get rid of them sooner or later. LGBT-free zones? Where do these people think they are? The Middle East? Such places have no place in Europe. Love to each and every Pole on this subreddit. <3

# Dear Finland & Estonia

Even though our countries are in no way similar, I still feel kinship with you guys, as we (arguably) speak a few of the most unique languages on Earth, but sadly our languages are the only Uralic languages that will survive in the long run, as others have no sole official status anywhere in the world and the number of native speakers are ever decreasing.

# Dear Russia

To me, you're a whole other universe in Europe, and I mean that in the most positive way imaginable. Your cities have an athmosphere no other places have. Seriously, when I was in Saint Petersburg, standing in front of the Winter Palace I felt something I've never felt anywhere else ever. And going on the Transsiberian Railway is a bucket list item of mine.

# Dear Greece

So much of everything we in the Western world know and love today has some connection to Greece. And Greek Mythology is the best thing I have ever looked into. Your history, your language, your islands, your cities, your cuisine and most importantly, your people. Literally everything about this country is as wholesome as it gets. Love to the Greeks!

# Dear Ireland

Ireland has a special place in my heart, even though barely anything connects me to this country. But I've always thought that Ireland is a country everyone loved for no specific reason. You people are just awesome, and your accents, especially the **South Dublin** accent is the sexiest, and most beautiful English accent I've ever heard. Eargasm everytime someone speaks in that accent. And I've always loved the fact that Ireland is the only country to have legalised same-sex marriage via popular vote. I view it as the openness of the Irish.

# Dear Netherlands

Without any intention to offend any of you, your language is the funniest thing I've ever seen and heard. I have had an acquaintance refer to the Dutch language as ""English with Down syndrome"". I want to know how you feel about this analogy. But on a serious note, I have always appreciated how open and accepting the Dutch society is, and I will repeat myself here, but I love the fact that the Netherlands was the first country in the entire world to legalize same-sex marriage. Best of wishes to the Dutchies.

# Dear Germany

The reason I left you for the end, is because I have the most to say about you. I just want to start by saying that I have nothing but endless respect and admiration for Germany and the German people. The way Germany made a complete U-turn and transformed from the Third Reich into what we know and love as Germany today, leaves me dumbfounded. And from my experience, it is very rare for a country to be so open about the darker chapters of its history. And sure, with all the evidence, it would be pretty stupid for Germany to even try to hide this, but it certainly didn't stop some countries from denying past attrocities. (Not going to say names, but we all know what countries I'm talking about). I mean even I had to find out about the massacres of my own country from English sources on the Internet, so there is that.

Germany has definitely learnt from the past (something which I can't really say about my country huh) and today is the beating heart of Europe.

Best of wishes to Germany, the other countries I mentioned and the countries I didn't mention. (I could've written a shorter essay on most countries in Europe) 🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺",2021-03-09 23:33:50

o7ii3i,">The urbanization struck hard against the villages during the industrial boom of the early 1900's, as well as a secondary boom in the late 1900's. That was presumably similar to what's seen in Spain now. 😐

That's exactly the issue, Spain is about a century behind. Massive urban sprawling is a pretty new concept in Spain. 
   


>You know what...
I could actually imagine buing a home somewhere around Soria (outside the city) in the (relatively near) future. My only hard requirements would be 4 walls and a roof; clean running water, either own well or communal water network, doesn't matter; and then also an acceptable Internet/cellphone connection - If not at home, then at least within reasonable distance. 

>Even electricity wouldn't be a hard requirement... even though being able to run a washing machine would be nice. For most other electronics I need/want, a solar panel would suffice.

>A tiny plot of arable land also preferable, but not a hard requirement.

I'm a bit struck by the amount of people who say this. Mainly because I don't know if you know how Soria is.  Let me paint it for you: 
  
Soria is a mountainous regions full of pine forests with tons of mushrooms, bitter winters (for Spain) and surprisingly hot summers. the specialty are fried pork rinds. If you know a bit about Spain it's pretty stereotypical, but if you know little about the country you'll be shocked by how different it is, as most Spanish stereotypes come from the south of the country.
   
So...did it fit with your assumptions?
   
Edit: by the way, legislation with solar power is actually a nightmare in Spain and it's definitely not as easy as putting some solar panels.",2021-06-26 17:07:52
gs1rbd,"Good point. I think this stems from the fact that France is a republic very much in name and outward appearance, but dig a little and it’s a cloaked monarchy. 

The president lives in a gold lined ‘palace’. It’s a presidential republic, being one of the earliest republics (yes we know they’re into their 5th Republic or whatever by now) they based their presidency very similarly to a Kingdom. Executive leadership, outside the government - similar to the USA. These proto-republics are somewhat creaking at the hinges as other more stable forms of democracy and electoral methods have established themselves. 

I think it would be to France’s great benefit to declare a 6th republic and once and for all establish a parliamentary democracy, with much stronger regions - to decentralise finally away from the palace!

Also, in our culture, you oblige the wishes of the customer and suit anything to his/her taste because customer is king.

ho3rky,"Here Spain. Oh this question is hard....especially for us but that makes the answer much more interesting. First off we have to get clear what you Meam by second language. As i see there are two ways of interpreting this:  
  
1) you're asking us to ignore the mother tongue.  
2) you're asking us to ignore the most used tongue.
    
That distinction IS IMPORTANT in our case.

So lets go with 1) according to the INE (national estadistic institute) the most common second language amongst people between 18 and 64 is english....with a whopping 40% of speakers 🤣🤣🤣🤣. Which means they're roughly counting everyone Who knows how to ""defend"" themselves. I'm telling this because they also assume 14% of people can speak french which puts It in first possition. This is almost as ludicruous as the 40% thing....which means that i'm going to ignore french though It has a higher percentage of ""speakers"" because of the abismal quality of the speakers they're counting. According to the study spain's most common second language (understood as not-the-mother-tongue and ignoring the previously satated ""overstatement"" in the study) is.....SPANISH with 9.1% of the speakers. Confused? Well, Spain has about 5 million inmigrants and many don't have spanish as their native tongue. Furthermore there's catalan with around 5 million native speakers...which translates to 5 million second tongue spanish speakers. To that you have to add gallician and euskera native speakers. That's a lot of people
   
2) i Won't do it...this would be hell to Search for....because as far as i know we don't take that viewpoint in statistics. It may be french... but i would still bet for catalan.

There's some people Who have just taken out the first language of the country and talked about the second. Spain's largest second language would be...no surprise catalan.
    
BUT if you want the simpler answer more in tune  with the rest...french....it's by far the most taught language apart from english and the official and cofficial languages of Spain. Almost nobody talks It right but many know some basics. I for one studied french for 5 years and couldn't mantain even the simplest of conversations.",2020-07-09 20:41:34

j33kxw,"Our schools indoctrinate us by teaching about Catholicism. Useful knowledge about different religions is basically non-existent. If it does exist, it does so only because the local priest has enough sense to know that his pupils need to understand the world as it is. 

We went to the church with our priest, we sang catholic songs, we watched catholic movies, we prayed in classes, we celebrated catholic holidays. And no, I was not in a catholic school, it was a regular public school. It's mandatory. If your parent decides that they don't want you to participate, they can do so by writing a letter to your school principal. You can also do so when you reach 18 years of age. You're supposed to attend to ""ethics"" lessons there, but I've got no idea what that is, as I was the only person in my high school to leave ""religious education"" lessons, so I sat in the hall for an hour every two or three days, watching movies on my phone. 😂

gclopd,"In Belgium, have been to a few:

-	School courses take 50 minutes each, but sometimes can take up two slots for 100 minute total. When that’s the case, there is usually a 5-minute break in the middle.

-	There are usually 7 courses in a day on Monday-Tuesday-Thursday-Friday, with sometimes 8 courses in later years. Wednesday always has 4 courses, and so ends at midday.

-	Exact times and durations differ from school to school, but in the ballpark:

-	2 hours of courses, then a 10-15 min break outside (same for elementary as for high school), then 2 courses, then 50 minute lunch (25 min eating, 25 min break outside), then 2 courses, then a 10-15 break outside, and then 1 last course.

-	School starts around 08:30, and ends around 15:30, give or take 20 minutes depending on when you started and how long your breaks were. On Wednesday, school ends at around 12:00.

-	In every school I’ve been to, there were 2 hours of Phys. Ed. per week. When the school had their own sports hall, people went to that room. When the school didn’t have their own sports hall, students walked to the nearby public sports hall or were driven there by a rented bus, depending on the distance.

-	In elementary school, students stayed in the same classroom while teachers left and returned. You had mostly 1 teacher for most courses (reading, spelling, art, world orientation (a mix between history, geography and biology)), you might still have another teacher for a select few courses (maths, phys. ed., religion, ...)

-	In high school, same thing. Students didn’t swap rooms except for a select few courses, though there were more courses with specially assigned rooms. You do your chemistry in the chemistry lab, you do your music education in the room with the piano, etc...

-	There is no formal equivalent to middle school, though in informal context it refers to the first two years of high school.

-	At university, it’s a bit more YOLO and chaotic. You’d get an agenda like [this](https://roostersync.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rooster_in_Outlook.png). Courses take about 60 minutes here, and swapping rooms is very common for students.

-	It’s never fun to wait an hour between two courses, so the university tries to match the lesson plans each year so it’s students get the fewest amount of “skip-hours” possible.

-	When you fail a course in university, you might want to redo it the next year and take the follow-up courses of the courses you succeeded at. But of course, some courses will overlap and there will be problems. You can discuss those at the student administration. The only way to never have courses overlap is to succeed at each course always.

-	Unlike elementary and high, when you fail your exams at university at the end if May or June, you get a “second seat,” you can retake your failed exams at the end of August or the start of September. That gives you plenty of time to study, and no summer holiday. Or combine both and cut in your studying time. Up to you, you’re an adult now.

-	Anyone is eligible to enter university, as long as they finished high school. This is in contrast to Germany, where only people from Gymnasium are eligible, afaik. No need to send letters, you just go to the student administration and join at the start of September. Studying costs about 1000 euro per year, not including rent or food; depending on the amount of courses. It can get cheaper if you have a low income.

-	Some courses, such as when studying to become a doctor or a lawyer, may have entrance exams. In those, only the best xx students may follow the course. If you’re studying IT or business, no such entrance exams exist.

______

-	Lastly, fun fact. “Blijf in uw kot” is the Flemish slogan for the Coronavirus “Stay at home”. *”Blijf in uw”* means *”Stay at your”* but *kot* is the Flemish informal word for *student housing.* Even so, it’s a fun word to say. *Kot, kot, kot...* and everyone knows what’s meant by this in Covid-19 context. 😋",2020-05-03 08:06:39

Like it's good to be aware of them and know the big ones, but the rest you can research if you need. Most US i would probably recognise when I heard then though, so there would be no need to clarify. But, tbh, people probably already knew you were from the US the moment you spoke, just like they would for any other English-speaking country. 

What throws me every time is the abbreviations. Sure some of them I can guess me way through, but in general it annoys me when people from the US uses them in international groups and then get mad if you ask for clarification. But that's a whole other ballpark.",2021-01-21 21:06:36

nm24d9,"It would be amazing if we could have some kind of attach-detach system where there are like 10 cabins that go from Amsterdam straight to Berlin, no stop. However, the train is 15 cabins long: the last 5 cabins each detach from the main train at intervals. So the last 5 cabins detaches near Utrecht and stop there, Amersfoort, Deventer and Almelo and Hengelo snd then reattaches itself to the next train somewhere around the German border. Then between Hengelo and the next German city half an hour later people have the option to switch between the Main Cabins or the Detach Cabins. Then after that half an hour, the last 5 detach again and pass by some German cities up to Hannover. And the process repeats once or twice. 

Basically every 5 intermediate stations you’d have a detached wagon that reattaches on the next train. 

The detachment and reattachment would happen during travel (perhaps during curves where they need to slow down anyway) as to reduce time. That way if it truly goes at a steady 200km/h you’d be in Berlin within 3.5h without any significant delay, while at the same time providing this high-speed opportunity for people at intermediate stops, though the detached cabins would probably go slower as they’ll have to mix with regular trains for spots at the stations. 

Ideally the cabins would have two walking lanes, perhaps on two floors, for switching between the Main and Detached Cabins. Also; a conveyor system for luggages in between the two floors.

Expensive! So fucking unbelievably expensive. I believe that we are the most expensive county in Europe and we only have a population of 360.000 people.

The currency is unbelievably unstable it goes up and down up and down like in a rollercoaster! Like if you think negatively about the Krona it goes down! 

Banks are awful, by I mean loans are disgusting here and by that I mean I can take you forever to pay off a loan (40-50 years for a house/mortgage) or for car (10 years or if you sell your car + loan).
We have something called “price index loansl” “index linked loans” and I think these types of loans are illegal according to EU because they are too confusing for the regular average joe to understand. (Somebody please corrode if I’m wrong here).

And similar like one Finnish dude said here somewhere, few families seem to own everything, they own the fish in the sea, own the super markets, oil service stations, real estate, and other huge companies etc and sometime seem like they are playing their own version of monopoly 🎲

We were more lax about it in the beginning, but we have adopted it in the last decade. 

In the past, the procedure was that there's a default romanisation scheme, but we could choose to diverge from it as an individual right ([page 2, point 6](http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/Embassies/Embassy_Mexico.nsf/All/92CF51936035F5B7862575F500623092/$file/%CE%91%CE%AF%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7%20%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1%20%CE%AD%CE%BA%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%B7%20%CE%AE%20%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AD%CF%89%CF%83%CE%B7%20%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%BB%CF%84%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85%20%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%85%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%82.pdf)). [That's not the case any more](https://deok.org.cy/files/aitisi_gia_ekdosi_deltiou_tautotitas.pdf) (page 3, point 5). My spelling with 'y' got grandfathered, but if I have children, they will probably not have the choice. 

I would be okay with automatic romanisation if it was a system other than ELOT, but if it has to be ELOT then I believe people should have the right to diverge from it. 

> Everybody in Greece is really familiar with Γεώργιος, Αθανάσιος, Μιχαήλ etc. When someone calls and says his name is Θάνος I always search for Αθανάσιος.

I dunno, I can understand having a small number of limitations on names, like reasonable length and nothing that is obviously harmful to the child, but I can't justify giving the government the right to decide which variant of my name I should have on my papers. If there's no reason to restrict something, it shouldn't be restricted. Name changes aren't particularly difficult in Cyprus in any case, if a Τάσος from birth decides they want to be officially known as Αναστάσης or Αναστάσιος in adulthood, they can just change it at the Civil Registry.",2021-05-04 15:19:17

ljohlw,"Teenage Sex. Before the pandemic we'd finish of our work at my boss's house and her son would bring his girlfriend at home and they'd greet and go to his room and every now and then they'd be creeking sounds and she'd go and knock at their door as like a keep it down please sign and sometimes he wouldn't be home when we get there and I'd as äk my boss where he is and she'd say today he's spending the night at his girlfriend's house and they were both like 16/18 not sure but till this day I still can't wrap my head around how casual the whole thing is. Back at home you can't bring your boy or girlfriends to your house if your parents are liberal you can but taking it to the bedroom is pushing it and very taboo and most liberal parents would consider that extreme.

The other thing is nudity. When you step into a photography shop it's shocking how they'll be pictures of half naked people not butt naked but enough to make one go hmmm. Even sculptures in the cities they sculpt actual Penis anatomy like exactly as it is with no filter. Even on cable tv how women's boobs are just displayed without blurring them out.

The other is teenage smoking and alcohol. On my way to work I'd pass by two schools and the number of kids smoking outside before class and sharing cigarettes was another culture shock. At home yes kids smoke too but it's more of a secret thing where no one sees you here they don't even shy from it and hide it even how when kids turn 16 ro 18 they smoke or drink with their parents. But yet again in back at homr we're very conservative so culture there discourages indulging in substances. 

Another is drugs it's also shocking how people take tablets for everything. Things like the flue or headaches or fever people just head to a chemist and get pills. I've also got into the habit of that also but at home we don't medicate for such like the flue for example most people either sleep it off or drink lemon mixes with garlic and some weird leafy concoctions. And coffee also. People at my work couldn't do anything without coffee. I'm also addicted now and everytime I start working without it I feel weak and not motivated.

Another is language for genitals. Funny how small kids here call a spade a spade. There's no pipi or pum pum or weenie a Penis is a Penis 😂 plain and simple.

Another is parenting and or the kids. They refuse to hit their kids when they're young. I've seen so many kids usually like 6-10/11 year olds throwing fits in public and the parents trying to de escalate the situations but failing so much to the point where other people step in and try to help because the parents won't know what to do. Even teenagers I once saw this other one telling his father to fuck off and all his father did was scold him and that was another culture shock back at home a kid cannot dare tell a man especially a father to fuck off because the kid's ass will be flying all over the place if they did.

Now I know most of these were generalised but that's what I've observed ever since I got here let me think of more and I'll update

Edit: another one is gender neutral toilets or changing rooms or hostels etc. When I was in Hamburg i booked into a hostel and the room I was in was being shared by 8 other people. I was the first the first to get to the room and I fell asleep after a few minutes I woke up when there was noise and I saw three girls in the room and I was confused why there were there. I checked the room info and stuff and it did say that the room was shared and gender neutral. That was another shock to me because back at home that's almost impossible the moment a hostel or school or whatever institute does that women will just stop using the toilets or rooms there completely because word will get around that there'd gender neutral toilets and attract the weirdos and the crazies that will start hanging around there",2021-02-14 17:08:58

* Haha, inbound for Culture shock right away... But seriously, think about it: Pretty much all teenage hookups in the US are done either in semi-public places or when the parents aren't home. Entirely away from their parents' awareness. Combine that with half-baked knowledge derived from Porn and school sex ed boiling down to ""muh! Abstinence!"" this is a recipe for disaster. Does any American parent honeslty believe they could preserve their teenage childrens' modesty through a combination of hushing up and keeping close taps on them? I mean they did it behind their parents' backs so believing you would be successful stretches it quite a bit. In Europe parents are a lot more chilled about it and also adress it openly. Many household treat preservatives as a shared commodity for example. The ""Condom-Drawer"" simply gets refilled with regular grocery shopping, no questions asked. But yeah, I would have never thought about doing the deed when the entire house was still awake.

* Compared to the US Europe is far more liberal than that. True. But that's also because depicting nudity in arts has been normalized for pretty much 500 years. We weren't founded by Puritans, so I guess that's what it boils down to.

* well, depending on the counntry you are in it's handled differently. In Germany you can get soft Alcohol at 16, ""hard"" Alcohol and Tobacco at 18. But it is not downright enforced as someone catching a minor smoking would call the Cops. Enforcement is seen to be mostly within the realms of parenting instead of passing it to law enforcement. I always found it rather bewildering that in the US you're considered fully of age at 18 but are still not allowed to drink until you turn 21. The same for gambling. Unless of course you join the military. Well, that would be even weirder: ""Yes, you're mature enough to take a gun and kill people but no, you can't have a beer just yet!"" 

&#x200B;

>Another is drugs it's also shocking how people take tablets for everything. 

* Side-effects of cheap medications. But on the other hand here's no opioid crisis in Europe as the use of those strong painkillers is heavily restricted and comes with their own mandatory weaning therapy so it keeps people from staying addicted to them and eventually switch to Heroin once the prescription runs out. The wildest drug-encounter I have had so far was some guy not just offering me Extasy but literally shoving it into my hands in Amsterdam and just name the price. I just gave it back and was likle ""let's pretend this never happened"" and the dude went off the same instance. Maybe I looked like a regular customer and he realized he's got the wrong guy. Don't know, don't care. Thought he was pretty polite and chill for a dealer. 

&#x200B;

> Another is language for genitals. Funny how small kids here call a spade  a spade. There's no pipi or pum pum or weenie a Penis is a Penis 😂  plain and simple. 

* To me as a parent it would be cringy AF if my children couldn't name their body parts correctly. Including their genitals. What's this toddler language supposed to achieve anyway? A Penis is a Penis, no matter how you call it. In my country most men refer to it as their ""Schwanz"" (tail).

&#x200B;

>Another is parenting and or the kids. They refuse to hit their kids when  they're young. I've seen so many kids usually like 6-10/11 year olds  throwing fits in public and the parents trying to de escalate the  situations but failing so much to the point where other people step in  and try to help because the parents won't know what to do. Even  teenagers I once saw this other one telling his father to fuck off and  all his father did was scold him and that was another culture shock back  at home a kid cannot dare tell a man especially a father to fuck off  because the kid's ass will be flying all over the place if they did. 

* Well, to be fair: physical violence only teaches a child how to avoid punishment. Sure they won't be acting up if they got their asses handed to them in broad daylight - but the only two lessons they are going to take away from this will be 1) Those who assert Dominance dictate the rules and 2) If you do something you are not supposed to you better find a way to hide it. You don't raise better kids that way.",2021-02-15 00:59:49

Austria: Fresh baked bread

Switzerland: crisp mountain air, pine trees

Italy: the smell of the sea along the Amalfi coast, and the smells of veg and  herb gardens in Rome. It seemed like every balcony and every nook and cranny of space in Rome had some sort of little garden growing in it.

They are a bunch of language Nazis who are constantly banning ""irregular"" words which lithuanians use in their everyday language. They also suggest new ""correct"" words to use instead of the wrong ones. The problem is, these suggested words are usually ridiculously awkward and just makes people laugh, (there is even a big meme group on FB to make fun of this committee). Some examples of VLKK work includes them trying to ban using English names for computer programes like Excel/Powerpoint. Lithuanian language has these incredibly hated word accentuation rules, and VLKK are huge fans of them - they even give fines for people on TV who fail to accentuate words correctly. I remember watching news when I heard the news reporter saying PradA and Dolce & GabannA, instead of the original PrAda and Dolce & GabAnna - not only they forbid to accentuate lithuanian words incorrectly, this rule also applies on foreign words, clothing brands in this case. It's just a game of absurd and official people and workers of the national TV are forced to play it.

fd9fp3,"Oh, my friend, you just mentioned the thing that has been provoking vigorous debates in Russian historical science since the 18th century. 
To start with, I would bring some context real quick. So in the 18th century Russian science was on a rise, especially because there were a lot of German, Dutch and Italian scientists invited here by Peter the Great. And there was one german historian, Miller, who was ordered to research Russian Primary Chronicle. And it says that  slavs from Novgorod and some other tribes invited Rurik ""to rule them"" form the overseas. Having calculated 2+2, Miller concluded that they invited a viking prince from the other shore of Baltics (most agree on ""swedish"", but I don't know if it was sweden back in 862 already or not, so I wouldn't dare to call it so yet).

Everything would have been great, but at the time Miller researched it, in Russia memories from the Great Northern war with Sweden were really fresh and, you know, his opinion wasn't popular. There was a prominent Russian scientist (though not exactly a historian), Michael Lomonosov, who debated Miller and brought arguments against his position. Lomonosov was a great scientist, but in this debate his main argument was equal to ""I don't like swedes, so let's find other theories""
And that ""finding"" process is continuing today 😭


This is called ""Norman question"" in Russian historiography. Anti-normanists (who support Lomonosov) usually bring arguments which are quite easily destroyed by Normanists (who don't support Lomonosov) but the debate continues today. Most historians, though, support the Norman theory and agree that Rurik was Swedish (or Scandinavian at least). Some say that he was the same person with Rorik of Jutland.
That, on the other hand, was a very useful debate for Russian historiography because it made historians discover many facts about our history while searching for arguments both for and against",2020-03-05 07:47:36

Swedish: I understood some words and even phrases, context and meaning of a sentence.

Danish: Worked quit well. Similar to swedish but a little bit better

German: That's my native language. I understood everything.

Flemish: I understood many things just fine. It is very far from perfect but I understood the meaning of many sentences and I could understand words from context.

English: Not my native language but I'm learning this language for already ~ 10 years. Now I have to choose if I want to continue learning Spanish or English at school. I'll take english😉

Low German: It was ok to understand.. Words which I didn't knew I could understand from context most of the time. I live in Hamburg and People used to speak lower German here but that language faded away over time. I still know some people who speak that and I also tried to learn this language.

Bavarian: Wasn't very hard either. It sounds similar to 'normal' German

Luxembourgish: There where many words I couldn't understand. Most of them not even in context of other words.

Africaans: It was really strange to read. There were some words written like German then there were some Flamish words and so on.. I understand only a few things.

Icelandic: No. It can not understand that.

Alemanic?: It sounds like a German light dialect and is quit understandable.

Frisian: My Grandmother is speaking Frisian. It's hard to understand her most of the time but I got used to it. I understood most of what was written there.",2020-02-01 22:39:00

Maybe I’m of a different time, but at school we used to sing that and Hitler’s only got one ball on the playground. To me it’s just a silly school song. 

In reference to OP, we have our own slew of anti-Irish ones. Including ‘no surrender to the IRA’, ‘fuck the IRA’, ‘fuck the Pope’ etc. Thankfully when we played each other a few years back in Dublin, we behaved. Although when England played Scotland at Celtic Park it was a different matter. 

Personally I find England fans who act like Rangers fans abroad as just embarrassing. Why you singing about the Pope in fucking 2019? As an English raised Catholic I just find the situation bemusing. 

I can appreciate the Black and Tans one, because they were bastards and deserved it. But it was slightly jarring walking to a music festival in the summer and a group of Irish lads were chanting ‘fuck your Union Jack, we want our country back’.

There was this guy living next to door to my sister. Really handsome, tall, athletic, brown hair, glasses and very sweet. Every time I was walking out of the building and he was there cleaning his car, taking care of the plants etc, he would wink, smile and then chat with me. He was super friendly which I am not used to because here talking to neighbors is a no no. 

So, I thought he was into me. (Before going to Greece, I was told it's a paradise for gay people, so I had high expectations I guess) and I searched him on Facebook and started talking to him online. Still he was very friendly but veeeeery friendly and I was thinking why isn't he making a move? I thought maybe he is shy, i'm gonna do the first move. I send him a nude 🙈 (Idk i was frustrated.) He was confused, then he cursed and then he told me ""i'm going to pretend this never happened"" and blocked me. After this incident, every time he saw me, he would turn his back on me and not look at me. I was dying from embarrassment every time.

ie5rby,"🇵🇹 

They just *are*... Like any other country. I don't really think about it... But, here goes, I'll do it too :

Andorra - neighbours! Well, the kind of neighbours on the 5th floor that only go out at 6am and come back at 11pm. They get their supermarket shopping delivered and barely tall to you. Everyone else on your floor seems to know them and party with them, but to me they are still a mystery... I think I know 10000000 people who've been there, I never have. 

Liechtenstein- I'm an art teacher and often have to look good Roy Lichtenstein. I always misspell it, makes my life difficult. Like Messershmidt and the planes. 

Malta- Malta is cool. Malta has like its own order of people in caddies looking cool, being welcoming and polite, all the while you know they are simply better than you. Must be, otherwise they wouldn't get to wear a cool cape. Imagine íf the over achieving science club all lived in the same place, but they also had super rich parents and were also prom Queen and King, but ran an illegal casino from their house basement where people spend millions. 

Great, now I'm just thinking Money Plane in some kids basement. Sure, I'll go with that. It's money plane, but the owners are *nice* and they leave before you can start going crazy. 

Monaco - sounds royal-ly. I imagine Monaco as the setting for every  hallmark movie where the heroine goes to Europe. Which puts me off a little... Still, I'll go some day

San Marino - the last one I learnt about (when I was a kid). Never really on my radar. Always had this idea on my head of the rebellious kids at school going fuck you, putting a flag up and saying ""this classroom is its own country now, fuck off"" be everybody around going ""who I suppose they be a country now, let's go home"" 

Vatican City - I understand the history, still find it weird that it exists. A religion owns a country, bizarre.... (for nothing against it though). Would like to go to have a look though, seems super interesting historically and artistically.",2020-08-22 09:39:03

I was with my husband in a fully packed restaurant in France. We were being quiet, just listening to the French people around us. A normal restaurant (in the US) would be loud/boisterous (bc lots of people), but the French sounded like a bunch of butterflies! Not “loud” but light and fluttery, and still somehow very lively — it’s hard to describe. But it’s a very nice sound. 

The only exception is this HON HON HON sound. It makes me laugh every time I hear it. French language is so pretty except this one funny guttural sound. 

In the US in the 90s-00s, we had a kids TV skit called ‘Everyday French with Pierre Escargot.’ He was supposed to teach the kids French, but it was a comedy satire—  and he always made this exaggerated HON HON HON sound in French. So now as an adult, I always hear this sound when anybody speaks French lol.

I don't think many people can still hear their native language, it's complicated because it sounds so usual / dull.  

And i usually don't think we are especially quiet considering the noise in some restaurants / bars here, but in comparison to many other people, there are some times where we're a bit more quiet haha. Southern cultures are usually louder and more expressive, at least it's the stereotype :)",2022-03-18 00:10:56
tg6w0s,"OK, I found some videos 😄 

The videos show Hon Hon Hon as the “French laughing” sound, but I also hear this sound in the middle of words when French people are speaking. I don’t know French, so I don’t have a perfect example, but I promise I hear this sound when you are speaking French in normal conversations with each other!

Just remember, these are comedy/satire to poke fun, it’s not meant to be hurtful, just funny, bad stereotypes 

[Everyday French with Pierre Escargot](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3FtmsZ17FZE) - the comedy skit all the 90s-00s American kids grew up watching on TV 

Recently, [a French newscaster in the US was interrupted](https://youtu.be/uGNKZ272doU) by a guy who definitely watched Pierre Escargot as a kid 



>*i usually don’t think we are especially quiet*

That is what I mean by the butterflies! When French are all together enjoying a restaurant/bar, they are lively (just like a bunch of butterflies are lively flying around a garden) — but they are lively in a very light and pleasant way. It’s still very fun and joyful, just like butterflies all together are joyful.

I know americans say we do it but i don't identify or hear this sound when french people laugh for example.

10¹² = Bilione;

10¹⁵ = Biliardo;

10¹⁸ = Trilione;

10²¹ = Triliardo;

10⁶ = Milione;

10⁹ = Miliardo (Bilione);

10¹² = Trilione;

10¹⁵ = Quatrilione;

10¹⁸ = Quintilione;

10²¹ = Sestilione;

kcsn91,"Reading his makes me feel pretty pissed off with my family to be honest. My experience seems so differnt to many in here. 

My parents are not religious at all but very uptight. Sex was just something you never spoke about. I was never allowed anyone to sleep over, boy or girl, as a young kid, and having a partner stay as a teenager would have been unthinkable. The first week I went to uni, my boyfriend stayed over - my parents found out about it and had a huge go at me, saying it was unladylike and I should save it for when I'm married. They were telling me how to live my life when away from them, in a place I was paying for myself - I was so angry. I respected their stupid rules for years but they clearly didn't respect my choices. The ridiculous thing is, nothing even happened that night and I soon then realised I was gay 😆.

After that, I never told my parents anything about my social life, full stop. They didn't ask and I didn't tell. They 'know' I'm gay but it's never talked about or acknowledged in any way. Their loss quite frankly. If I ever have kids, I'd rather they have a safe and supportive environment to experiment, and be treated with love and respect.",2020-12-14 19:23:32

Well, gee, this is a subjective matter and they are to me.

On two accounts. One, and to a lesser degree, the fact that a law abiding private citizen thinks it necessary to carry a gun in a urban, non-hunting context is unsettling to me and I'd say to many people who grew up where that's highly unusual. 

Two, and to a greater degree, the issue for me would be the — statistically irrelevant all you want — minority who has mental issues and is carrying a gun. 

Knowing how many states allow you to buy guns as easily as a loaf of bread, without a permit or psychological screening of any kind, makes me nervous. That's just me. 🤷‍♀️

If you exclude China from the statistics, the amount of people living in poverty has gone from 62% in 1982 to 56% today.

You’re super naive and angry and you should actually calm down and open your eyes to some horrible shit that’s happened in this world.

It's always called aubergine if you see it in the vegetable section of a supermarket too.

Then there's a trend in both countries where the purists who are ignorant of the other code complain because they think it's ""Too Gaelic rules"" or ""too Aussie Rules"" so they snub it. And then there's rising and falling interest in it, so not always the best teams are sent. In 2013 Australia said ""fuck it"" and sent an All-indigenous team just to shake things up.

I was born and raised here, have a thick Scottish accent, am very in-keeping with the typical Scottish look (aka am extremely white and don't look 'Mediterranean' at all), and other than my surname anyone would take me as completely Scottish on paper. 

Greek was actually my first language as my Greek parent was the one who stayed home and took care of me as a baba, but he stopped speaking it to me after someone (wrongly) told him it would interfere with my ability to speak English. I think if I still spoke the language I'd feel like I had more right to identify with Greece but as it stands my only connections are my friends and family there and a few three-week visits a year (under normal circumstances), so while I love it dearly and feel very proud of any association with Greece, I don't think anyone would consider me 'properly' Greek.

I do treasure those 5% though, as it feels as though they did give me an ever so slightly different upbringing from someone who identifies as 100% Swedish. I also have a Norwegian surname which, for obvious reasons, I will not share, but its quite uncommon here.

kad1tt,"Romanian last names can be really simple things, sometimes animals:""Păun(Peacock)""; ""Lupu/Vâlcu/Lupuleasa"" (all meaning wolf); (""Ursu"" - Bear) and more. 
They can also be plant names:""Trandafir(Rose)""; ""Bradu"" (Pine tree) etc
Or Jobs:""Popa""(Priest, a name that is really common) Ciubotaru (Shoemaker, just like that one Racer, Schumacher) or Croitoru(Tailor).



In Romanian, the variation of composed surnames is pretty big, so allow me to explain:

""-escu"" at the end of a name means ""Child of"" and before that you can put First names or sometimes Job names: ""Georgescu""-> ""Child of George"" or ""Popescu(probably the most common name in Romania)""-""Child of the Priest"" 

There is also that more Slavic form of ""-Schi""/""-ski"" at the end, which might represent a Slavic origin of the name but a bit romanised, like ""Macedonski""(a poet who basically takes his name from Alexander the Great)

Probably more common in the North and north West of Romania, names which kinda indicate belonging which start with an ""A-"" and end with ""-ei"" as an example:""A-Nistoroa-ei"" (Child of a woman called Nistoroaia) or ""A-Catrin-ei"" (Child of a woman called Catrina) ""A-Marin-ei""(Child of a woman called Catrina), of course ""A-lup-ei""(Child of the wolf) is also a common name, so it doesn't have to be a name, it can be any substantive (I guess, the variation is huge)

There is also the ending ""-vici"" just like the Slavic ""-vic""(Like Goran Bregovic who is a Bosnian born of a Croat and a Serb) which also basically represents ""Child of someone""

gdju1w,"Hungary🇭🇺 - nah, we're cool. We had a lot of historical beef, but now we are good.


Romania🇷🇴 - tbf probably our best neighbour. We aren't culturally as similar as other EX-YU countries (obviously), but we didn't have any conflicts historically and I don't think we will in the near future.


Bulgaria🇧🇬 - Same as Hungary, just maybe a little bit closer culturally.


North Macedonia🇲🇰 - country that we are mostly cool with from EX-YU ones (along with Slovenia) and they have their own stuff going with Albania and Bulgaria.


Albania🇦🇱 - Well obviously we have a lot of disputes with albanians (mostly Kosovo ones), but as a country I don't think they intend to fight us, neither do we (unless some crazy sh*t happens on Kosovo).


Montenegro🇲🇪 - People of the two are very close and hostile towards each other (mostly), but our goverments are not in good shapes lately and montenegrin politicians intend to make their own orthodox church, which is obviously not a good sign for our people there. However, in the near future I think our goverments will match each other as well as people do (also depends on which person do people elect as a president)


Bosnia and Herzegovina🇧🇦 - This is the one I'm most worried about. We quite recentelly fought during the breakup of Yugoslavia (which is multicultural federation in most of it's existence) and today's Bosnia and Herzegovina is very similar to that model, consisting of three constituous groups that (almost) hate each other. Some things will happen there for sure, but I can't predict whether it will be a war or just a smaller conflict.


Croatia🇭🇷 - We can't admit we are very similar to each other and that's our main problem. After the war, Croatia clearly ""said"" that they don't want to do anything with us in the future, we did the same and we just kept the distance since then. I don't think there will be a war between us as long as we aren't being too close, because Yugoslavia proved that that's not possible (as of now).

Germany 🇩🇪 - I know that we have fought 3 wars in 100 years, 2 of which were among the deadliest in history, but today there is no longer any direct tension between our countries.  A lot of French people close to the border will spend a day or a weekend in Germany sometimes.  But there are still a lot of people who don't like Germany because they see the country as the ""leader"" of the European Union and want a system based more on a Europe of nations (it comes from De Gaulle).



Switzerland 🇨🇭 - We only know the part of Switzerland that speaks French and we like them a lot, we don't know too much about the rest.  It doesn't look like it, but a lot of famous French people were born in Switzerland like Jean-Paul Marat, Rousseau or Napoleon III, so our stories are really interconnected.



Italy 🇮🇹 - I say this because I live less than 100km from the border but I think they are our favourite neighbours.  We have a fascination for the Italians, their culture, their gastronomy that we see as almost on a par with our own.  We love to go there and spend a few days in Turin, Genoa or Milan.



Monaco 🇲🇨 - It's a city-state where most people speak French.  The people who go there are either because they are millionaires or because they want to look at the beautiful cars while walking along the beach. 

 

Spain 🇪🇸 - We don't speak much about Spanish people in France (the last time we talked about it was with the history of Catalonia).  Nice people that many people see as a poorer country than us, so cheaper and go there mostly to buy cheap products and resell them in France.  It's quite sad, but we still enjoy the landscape and the climate when we go there.

So we are villains to each other.🌚  And the second problem is that our politicians, unlike Norway and Europe, are extreme without middle. A few years ago, the prime minister of Japan was a huge liberalist, and our president at that time was completely conservative. He often did things that upset Japan. Lol And our current president is a progressive and feminist, and their current prime minister is a chauvinist and revisionist.💀Lastly, South Korea and Japan are competing, not mutually complementary. Our economic structure is almost same. And, paradoxically, both South Korea and Japan dislike/hate China but still want the Chinese market.

It might take a full generation to _really_ switch. 🤷‍♀️",2021-09-14 17:07:18
po6km9,"Idk about the currency in Croatia, but if its weak, the sooner you change to the euro the better. 

We also went from big numbers to small ones, but it really doesn't matter since the value is the same. 

Like 5 euros were 1000 escudos at the time of the conversion. 
Someone who made 100.000 escudos,  or 100 contos, started making 500 euros. 

I wasn't even 10 when the change happened I think, we learned the conversion in school straight away. 
I remember people had to change all their money to euros, any money you had physically had to be exchanged at the bank.

Honestly ? I was born in 93 and from I don't know anyone my age that can convert escudos to euros besides me. People younger than me dont even remembers the old currency. 

This wasn't even my parents first currency change, the currency was slightly difernt when they were young, they don't even compare it to the old one anymore. We only talk old currency when we are referring to things bought in that time period when it was used. 

It's harder on the elderly, everyone else will adapt fine. 

In my time we had calculators with an euro button to do the conversion, I bet someone will make a phone app just for that 😂.

Edit: the price or everything went up, despite the godman conversion,  things almost doubled. 
Example, a piece of gum was 5 escudos, it became 5 cents. 
Well, 5 cents is 10 escudos. 
Things that were 100 escudos, became 1 euro. 
1 euro was 200 escudos. 

It was this really weird twilight zone situation. Where the salaries where literally converted, but a lot of things just doubled.",2021-09-14 20:41:30

po6km9,"I was 16 years old, I think, when we adopted the euro. If I remember correctly, all the prices had to be written in both € an SIT for some time before the change, so people got a better feeling for the prices. I still remember the conversions we used: 1€ = 240SIT, 5€ = 1200SIT and 1000SIT = 4.19€.
In general prices were rounded up, but that mostly happened in a few months before the change and the change really wasn't that big - I remember a cup of coffee went from 220SIT to 1€.
We were still calculating prices to Tolars for a few months, but after that the Tolar was more or less completely forgotten. I don't remember when was the last time I encountered someone calculating € to SIT, but it was probably more than 10 years.

A funny thing a friend said soon after the change, trying to express that he feels he has less money now because of €: ""Ever since we got the €, I don't even have a Tolar anymore"" 😁.",2021-09-15 11:32:11

But ever since the Netherlands has been a country, it has been a very trade oriented country. Since it's also a small country with a small language it helped for our traders to know their foreign languages. So foreign languages have been part of our culture for centuries.

With improvements in education and availability this has spread from the relative small group of traders to the whole country. And with English being the trade language of the world it's the most important one to learn.

The most famous of them are the Indian Empress, the Mongolian Queens, the Japanese Princess, and the first South Korea's first lady from Austria. Another story is that one of the presidents of South Korea was born in Japan and he immigrated to South Korea after birth(some people say he's a half Japanese-South Korean). The funny thing is that Osaka city was built a large monument and celebrated in the birthplace of this South Korean President. And the South Korean President, ashamed of that fact, denied the monument of Osaka city by saying that his hometown was Pohang city.

The relationship between South Korea and Japan is complicated and hard to explain. Our politics and diplomatic relations are at their worst, but South Korean culture is super popular in Japan.

Although they had different political thoughts, they were Koreans in common and thought that Korea was same country. However, as communism spread rapidly in East Asia, North Koreans who pursued capitalism fled to South Korea, and South Koreans who pursued communism fled to North Korea. Most of the elderly North Koreans living in exile in South Korea are those who lived in a period when North Korea and South Korea had no borders like Austria and Germany.

fps4q6,"The Smolensk Kremlin. Built in the very beginning in the 17th century to protect Russian western borders from the looming war with Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, it js the longest fortress wall in Russia (though some parts of the wall have been destroyed through the centuries).

The fortress held the Polish army for 2 years from attacking Moscow. Actually, it even played its role during the Napoleonic invasion of 1812, though its construction that had gotten outdated by that time and therefore the Kremlin wasn't really important.

Today it is one of the symbols of Smolensk. However, unfortunately, the authorities are more busy with embezzlement and other schemes today, so the Kremlin is in bad condition. I hope that someday they will at least try to maintain it. If not, then I am afraid for it 😟",2020-03-27 15:13:46

mv2hoz,"Pretty cool, also pretty normal after a while. When I was quite young we rode to France by bicycle and I didn't even fully comprehend it. It was special mostly because it was a long tour.

Near the German Swiss border you can just stroll down the valley and end up in the other country without noticing, despite them still having border controls, technically.

It's normal for me to cross over into France when I take my racing bike for a spin as some of the roads there are better and have less traffic. Well, it was pre Covid.

On the other hand it never gets completely normal as there are many minor and major stumble stones like language, traffic regulations and conduct, public transport and ticket rules, public holidays, opening hours.

One thing I noticed and saddens me a bit is how little we humans talk to each other these days. I have spent entire day trips in France without talking to a French person beyond a bonjour.

Also, I've been to the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Czechia,Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia, Bavaria, Spain, France, Italy Greece, some of those many times, and still feel like an underperformer because there are so many things and entire countries ""nearby"" I haven't seen 😉",2021-04-21 11:11:14

But in Normal Times™ people just pop over the border fo work, shopping, leisure or just because they feel like. Depending on where live, you may even need to cross the border for your commute because it's faster than staying within the country.

I live in Antwerp near the Netherlands, lots of people go to Breda for shopping, and I personally pop over a few times a year to go scubadiving in Zeeland.

At least a few times each year, we spend the weekends abroad in our family (either with my parents, or with my SO's). Usually Netherlands due to proximity, but we've done France and Germany a few times as well.",2021-04-21 11:30:38

In Czech language they would be pointless as the words are mostly written as they are pronounced. I can imagine such contests for foreign languages like English, French, or Spanish - older kids usually have some knowledge of at least one foreign language, so they could compete in that.

ETA: Well, I just remembered that Czech language competitions do exist and I even took part in one at about 14 (which was along time ago 😔 ).

In the UK, they’re elected every 5 years; here’s a bit more from the government website: 


General election

General elections (elections to the UK Parliament) usually take place every 5 years.

To vote in a general election you must:

•be registered to vote

•be 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)

•be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen

•be resident at an address in the UK (or a British citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years)

•not be legally excluded from voting


There are 650 Members of Parliament (MPs) in the UK Parliament.

MPs are elected using the First Past the Post system. You vote once for a candidate in your constituency and the candidate with the most votes becomes your MP.",2020-11-05 11:46:41

My grandma cried when she found out, because she ""fears she doesn't know what will come of me"". 

So yeah, no pressure 😅

jix2wi,"🇨🇮🇺🇲 From the other comments, it sounds like it's the same in Europe as it is in the USA. As an older guy with kids in their 20s, here's a little perspective and wisdom:

1. It's not ""too expensive"" to get your own place. It's too expensive to move out and get a place as nice as your parents' place. Duh. They didn't have it that nice at your age, either. We started out living in sh*tty rental units and scraping by on pennies and we worked our way up by saving and making do without. But, we were proud because we did it on our own without help. Yes, we had student debt and had to eat Ramen a lot and had to dodge the bill collectors. But look at what we managed to achieve. You dont get to start out in luxury. You have to go earn it. 

2. Having a baby means not getting a good night's sleep for the next 18-20 years. Having a baby or young child is exhausting, both physically and mentally. You want to do that while you're young enough to take that. I cant even imagine trying to go through that later in life. 

3. When your kid grows up, you have the chance to be friends with him/her as an adult and do grown up activities with him/her.  If you're too old at that point, though, you won't ever get that joy. 

4. After your kids are grown and have left home, you get a whole new life of your own. You can travel, take up new activities, move somewhere cool, whatever. You want to do that before you're too old to enjoy it. 

5. For women, there are health risks to consider when having children later in life - both to the woman and her child. Modern medicine has helped, but it hasn't eliminated the risks. 

6. When you get to my age, you kinda hope that you will live long enough to see your grandchildren.  I'm only 50, but I already know people who have had heart attacks, cancer, and other serious illnesses. Sure, MOST people live into their 80s these days... but there's no guarantee.  So, yeah, you have that in the back of your mind when your grown child is still living like a teenager in your home and won't go get started on his/her own life.",2020-10-27 10:11:22
jix2wi,For me  🇵🇹personally I know I’ll probably live with my parents till mid 20’s and have kids I hope in my 30’s :) my parents had me at 40/39 and that worked well so im thinking of doing the same,2020-10-27 15:26:49
jix2wi,"Not really I don’t think. Everyone knows how hard it is for young people to find a decent job and accommodation. In my experience, it’s even seen as irresponsible to bring a kid into that. 

Marriage... I don’t think people care that much. Some people want to and do it, but it’s up to you really. No one is going to pressure you. Well, maybe your grandparents 😂",2020-10-27 18:56:01
jix2wi,"Yep, can confirm house prices are a joke in the UK (or, more importantly, the lack of a cap on rental prices is huge problem that prevents young people being able to save for a deposit). I'm in my mid-thirties, single, have a Masters degree and have been in a professional job for ten years. Only now am I starting to look at buying a house.

But in answer to OPs question, I think things have changed drastically since I was at school in the 80s/90s - when racism, sexism and homophobia were still rife. Feels like we live in a fucking paradise now to the days of Section 28 and AIDs warning adverts.

Alongside this social change has come a change in attitudes to what is considered a family 'norm'. So many families are now single parent or same sex couples etc., that expectations on children have changed dramatically since my parents' generation that grew up in the 50s/60s. 

My parents still talk about 'courting' and got annoyed  when they found out I had a guy stay over in my room at university. Oh the horror for a young lady 😆! (I'm also gay which makes it even more amusing). After that, I never told them anything about my social life so their loss really. There was definitely an expectation from them and everyone in their age group that I would have kids one day. It wasn't spoken about but just assumed. The number of times growing up I was told 'you'll change your mind one day', 'wait till you get broody' if I mentioned anything different. Eurgh.

But these days, parents seem to be much more open and supportive. They realise most people have relationships before marriage and many don't get married at all (personally, the idea has never really been appealing). And there's way more support for young LGBTQ+ people; although still a long way to go obviously.

But yeah, the change in attitudes over the last 20 years has been staggering and wonderful to behold.",2020-10-27 10:07:25

Our debit card network (branded as Bancontact™) is a very Belgian thing - for instance, I've heard stories of people with foreign bank accounts (but still EU) having difficulties on some Belgian websites. (Our IBAN's are shorter, for instance.)",2021-02-07 14:27:31
lel6v0,"I guess? 

I've literally never seen this outside of Belgium. At my bank in Canada, you get a card with your name on it, same as here, but to log in to the website, you just make up a password, like any other website.

Transferring money directly from one account to the other (*My IBAN is BE05 XXXX....*) is also very uncommon. Banks do indeed *have* them, yes, but literally nobody uses them unless you're doing an international transfer. 

Instead, the debit card network (called *Interac*™) takes care of that [function](https://www.interac.ca/en/consumers/products/interac-e-transfer/). It's a paid service - 50c if you're sending under $100, and $1 if it's over $100. 

It's almost as if instead of moving money from IBAN to IBAN directly, you had to go via Bancontact/Maestro directly and pay *them* each time you did it. 

Otherwise, cut your friend a cheque or pay them back in cash.

I was baffled, never having found one in the UK (this was in 97). I got curious and drove up the next weekend. I offered to do the dishes to put the mixing tap through its paces. As I was used to do I opened the cold water, then the hot water and the tested the temperature, only to quickly withdraw my hand, as I had scolded it in burning hot water. I inspected it and found to my surprise that the mixing tap wasn’t in fact mixing.  Instead the to pipes were separated until the end of the faucet, so that you had a stream of water which was burning hot on one side and cold on the other. It was as if the engineer who constructed it had heard of mixing tabs, decided to build one but had missed to understand the underlying principle 😂",2021-02-07 22:32:38

o4209d,"I have a lot of stories from that year, like three or four big crazy stories every month, a roadtrip or a music festival once a month and epic moments every week we go out. Many of them are unbelievable seen now in retrospective and it's mindblowing to me just thinking how fool and crazy I was back then (when I was young...). Me and my erasmus friends are still very close to each other, we have travelled across Europe together, went to some weddings together, the children have been coming and all the kids call me now ""uncle"" and we see each other every year! Thanks to the Erasmus program and the low cost flying programs nowadays is possible to plan just a weekend together in Rome, Bologna, Amsterdam, Freiburg, Marseille, or Málaga. Remains without a doubt the best year of my life so far, and probably will be forever.

And by the way, some of the stories were so wild we still keep as secrets only we know, we didnt even tell to our SO (they just wouldnt understand it without context). What happens in the Erasmus stays in the Erasmus!! ✌🏼🇪🇺",2021-06-20 11:52:57

King's day was great fun. Being from the UK I wish we had a similar celebration here each year 🤣 it was the best year of my life and I enjoyed it greatly. I still have some friends I'm in contact with from that time and hope to be in contact with  long term :)",2021-06-20 15:11:38
o4209d,"I did an Erasmus in Italy a few years ago.

There was a terrorist attack outside my local supermarket - and it didn't even make the news back home.

My housemate was missing, and her mother called us all trying to find out where she was... It turned out she was asleep.

But when we first heard it on the news, it said that foreigners were being targeted, and there was no word on the attacker being caught/if he had acomplices initially. So naturally, with all of us being foreign - we were terrified.

As it turns out, the attacker was a neo-Nazi and targeted black people specifically. Luckily nobody died in the end at least. 

Most of my housemates were Chinese, and after the initial news we (especially them) were scared of going to the shop. A few of us took a bus to a different town to go shopping so that we could avoid walking to the area.

A day or two later, I went into town because my phone broke and I needed to get it fixed. The entire city was blocked off (a walled city), and there was over 7 police cars blocking off the main junction where you enter the city beside the university. Because some neo-Nazis (a grand total of 7, I later heard) were protesting the attacker's arrest.

There was also a counter-protest that marched around the city. And when I asked the police officer what was happening, he said that it was dangerous in the area, and some of the protests got violent, and it would be safest to go home.

After that, the whole thing ended, almost as if it never happened in the first place. To this day, any time I mention it to people at home, they hadn't even heard there had been a terrorist attack in Italy. Sometimes I still have to search the news stories online to make sure that it really happened.

Oh and, mildly less interesting - but I was also the only native English speaker in the university at that time. I was quite surprised because the university also taught courses through English. Basically everyone wanted English lessons off me🤦‍♀️

ism0t9,"Sure. Where we are positioned, the weather can be very erratic. 

One day it can be 40 during the day, cool change in the evening can drop down to 20 in an hour or so.  Sudden drops lead to hail and heavy rains.

November to March expect 30 or more during the day. Not always, but always be ready for it.

Right not it's spring. Nights and mornings can be below 10 during the day low 20s.

Also different people take the weather differently. Someone from north Queensland (tropical part) would find Melbourne weather on the cool side. 25 for them is long sleeve, for me it's a t-shirt.

In the winter, there will be mornings with frost on the grass and cars. Disappears quickly and doesn't stay.

I should mention that I grew up in Canada and moved here as an adult.

l4jfko,"So France speaking 🇨🇵 : You're only allowed to respond to violence after attack and in the same range of violence. If you took a slap, you can't just go mental and bit the crap out the other people, no matter who started it. And condamnation will be depending on your past, mental ability, preparation and reasons. And by gun laws, if you own a gun you're not allowed to shot anybody unless you're in real danger against your life and you can prove it. Otherwise it's just attempt of murder.
Every violence won't get in to trial, really depends of the gravity and the victim. If a fight with no injuries in the street gets stopped by the police they'll just put both of them in ""garde a vue"" for like 48h, and unless somebody files a complain not much happens",2021-01-25 18:50:36

On top of that, violent criminals at that scale are normally either in our version of a higher security prison or, if it’s decided they committed their crimes because of mental illness but they’re still a danger to society, a forensic psychiatric clinic - basically a cross between a mental hospital and a high security prison 😉",2021-01-25 20:05:33

evadq3,"Imagine having about 2500 years of history 🤣

We learned mostly about Ancient Greece, the Byzantine Empire, Ottoman Empire 400 years Occupation, and the 1821 Revolution against it.

There was no time for WW1, WW2, the period in-between, post-WW2 civil war, and the military dictatorship that followed.

It's strange to only learn about distant times and ignore the most recent and relevant ones. Now that I am older I also realise that history classes were mostly aimed at forcing nationalism and pride upon children. Not being taught about recent history, while glorifying the positive aspects of ancient times can fuck up generations.

We were never taught that ancient greeks built their civilization on slavery and unpaid woman work. How democracy was only for few privilledged men. How philosophers were executed for their ideas, and how often civil wars occured. I'm not saying it was not a great civilization, but I would have prefered to get a more unbiased view on it.

When I was 12 I was on public transport with my grandmother. We were quietly talking to each other in Polish when a grown man started verbally attacking us,  telling us to fuck off to our shit country among other things. We were terrified, he was so aggressive. Fortunately a young guy in his 20s(?) got up from his seat and helped us get rid of the aggressor. I was so scared, I refused to speak Polish for several days.

Or when I was trying to set up an account with a phone company and the person at the counter suddenly turned very cold once I told them I'm Polish. They started telling me, that I needed a certain kind of document that immigrants from Non-EU countries have, to open an account, which i know wasn't true, because Poland had been in the EU for a couple of years at that point and we didn't need that any more. Even after I told them all of that, they refused to listen to me. I didn't have it in me to fight them on that, I was 18 and basically still a child.

There are several other stories, but these were the first that came to mind.

But google says indeed it is Moroccan. 


“The song is an Arabic song, sung in the Moroccan dialect. Although the phrase ""a ram sam sam"" has no discernible meaning, other words in the song may be translated as follows:[2]

Guli guli guli: tell me, tell me, tell me
A rafiq: friend, companion
When not played as a game, this song can also be (and very frequently is) sung as a round.

The game is played by a group of children. The song is sung by the group leader and the participants should perform several actions during certain lyrics, usually:

A ram sam sam - pound fists, right over left, then left over right.
Guli guli - pull hands apart gesturing as if something were gooey
A rafiq - spin index fingers on either side of the head (like someone is crazy), ending with the fingers pointed up.”

Usually [for our regional cards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_playing_cards) there's no such big difference*, I can go play with cards from other regions and have them figured out in one round or so, yet I think aces might be hard to read from region to region (there's a region where the ace of coins/diamonds looks like the cover of the deck and not a real card). In Norway people play more dices/yatzy instead, so many people would play French games with French cards and are not aware of others.

- You must always and only ""cheers"" with alcohol, never ever water. When you ""cheers"" you must also look into the other person's eyes d should not put the glass down without taking a sip first. Otherwise the ""cheers"" is void and you will get bad luck.

- An old one too, from the north, if you want an annoying guest to leave your house, put a broom upside down behind the door.

- When doing a test / something important you should enter the room with your right foot for good luck. Kids take this to the extreme, hopping with their right foot only and even going past shadows on the floor with their right foor first.

There are literally thousands in my country, but those are the ones that come to mind. 

Oh, On new year's, you should eat a raisin for each of the last 12 seconds of the year, asking a wish each time. You should also be standing on a chair and jump down at the last seconds. All your wishes will come true! (yes, even if you don't like raisins!)

-never ever turn a fish around when you are eating it. You should instead remove the bones, then continue eating. Otherwise the boat which caught it might turn. 

-never give someone a clock, it puts an ""expiry date"" on their life

-never print a photo in black and white, that should be reserved for funerals /photos of the dead. It will make the person die sooner

-never stock your chopsticks vertically on rice, they look like funerary incense, means death

-never gift someone a green hat. To wear a green hat means you have been cheated on. At least that one is not about death though!

f8f2rv,"For Italy, it is canonically 1861, the year the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed. However, if we want to talk about when something resembling Italian culture and identity actually came to be, I'd either go with 476 a.D. (the year the Roman Empire fell), or, even better, 568 a. D. (the year the Lombards invaded Italy). I find the latter date to be particularly significative, since the germanic influence of the Lombards was very important in the formation of Italian culture, even though most Italians do not realise this. Another good and more recent candidate could be 1492, the year the Middle Ages ended, a fellow Italian gave rise to colonialismo and, most importantly, Lorenzo de'Medici died. This last event is crucial because de'Medici's Death signed the end of the first phase of the Renaissance, and politically destabilised the peninsula, since he was the only thing keeping the Signorie from going for each other's throat. Soon after his death, the French invaded the peninsula and started the Italian Wars, and then it was all a downwards spiral from that. So, yeah, 1492 is a good date because it ushered in the good ol' Italian tradition of putting petty disputes ahead of the common good and switching political alliances more often than clothes🙃

The ones who don't know the language pretty well, but are ready to learn aren't such an issue, since they'll sooner or later reach that point, and more or less blend into the general society.

To be honest, I wasn't really aware of Turkey having such a problem with Arab migrants. Western media mention only - if at all - high number of war refugees now living in Turkey; but the problen with rich Arab migrants is rather unheard of.

What strucked me a bit is how you describe Arab migrants ""living in their own world"", because this description follows quite closely how some groups of Turkish emigrants in Germany are sometimes described (I don't know them personally, so I have to follow media reports on that) - basically closing themselves in their own, small worlds with only Turkish colleagues, friends, shops, bars... . To be clear, Turkish minority isn't the only one with this problem (it's simply the biggest one), I've personally heard the same claims about Italians, and even Poles (which makes me especially ashamed, trying hard to not fall into this trap). 

I presume the problem is rather universal, and stems from  the not very good traits in the human nature. What can we do? My minor contribution is trying to push fellow expats here to learn German and use it more often... can't do much more...🙄",2019-09-12 21:51:12

nfex9k,"I didn't write the traffic code, that's just how it is. I don't know what's so hard to understand. Hazard lights are for hazards. A sudden traffic jam approaching at 160 km/h on the highway is as good a use any.  It's a higher level of *HEY, WATCH THE FUCK OUT AND SLOW DOWN! STOP NOW!*

BTW, I am Canadian living here for over a decade. There are some irks about German driving for sure, and I do miss turning on red without a special signal. But all in all, I think Germans are far better drivers than in Canada.  Every time I go back home I am reminded of this.

When there's a traffic jam on the highway, people also leave a *Rettungsgasse.* When you merge lanes, everyone gets their turn via *Reißverschlussverfahren* (most follow it, anyway). People actually follow right-before-left, there's no idiots overtaking on the right and flying past you at 110kmh in a 90 zone without a single flash of any signal. (Passing on the right is so common -- in Ontario at least -- you'd be mistaken for believing it's generally legal, although it is not.) In many places here, cars are actually good and accomodating with bicycles, unlike in Canada.

In general, people here do *tend* to actually follow the rules, whereas in Canada, it's only a suggestion because everyone knows better, and it's only ever the *other guy* who can't drive. 🙄

o1a5c7,">One more question, could you elaborate on

>> useful (to me) constructions

To me, they're useful when navigating through social relations. It's not really about hierarchy (it definitely was in the past though), but rather about how close you are to another person. Taking one way to another is a statement of agreement on how close our relationship is. It's also a way for a third person to immediately understand how close we are. You don't have to ask ""do you know each other good?"" if it's clear from the pronouns they use.

In English, I sometimes feel like on a minefield in this regard. This addional information actually makes a difference to me.

Honestly, I'm even a bit surprised that you Nordic people don't feel a need to have this ""more distanced"" way of speaking, taking into account your stereotypical preference to keep the distance (not only physical) in social situations. Or maybe you sticking to casual speech everywhere is a kind of counterbalance to that? 🤔",2021-06-18 13:20:21
o1a5c7,"Well, I can also only talk about my experience. But that's true that especially in work place, especially where there's not that many older people, it's common to go with informal speech from the start (both Germany and Poland). E.g. I use ""du"" when talking to my boss, but go with ""Sie"" to a cashier in a shop, or my doctor. In my mind, it's because I'm closer to someone who I work with, than a random supermarket worker, or the doctor I see twice a year.

At work, I usually use ""Sie"" to people from outside of my company or projects, e.g. for external workers coming to do cabling in the building. But the externals hired directly by us, e.g. to maintain our hardware are ""du"" - I believe that's because they're  ""closer"" to us. Coming regularly and interacting more often, they feel like being part of some ""inner circle"", in contrast to someone contracted one time to install shelves or something 🤔

Using formal speech may be a bit rude if it's obvious that it's not fitting, but can be also used in a joking manner. Addressing a friend as ""Herr/Frau X"" or ""Sie"", or ""Pani/Pan"" (in Polish) can easily lead to a lot of laughs, which is IMO a good thing 🙂 it's one of this small things you can do to make conversation a bit more funny.

The opposite however, using informal speech where the other one is expected, can easily be taken as rude. If you do it, it's either because you purposedly want to offend someone, or you greatly misunderstood how close you two are (and then it's very awkward).

But, as I said before, this is also something that changes over time. A few decades ago it could've been different and hierarchy maybe played a more important role. But I'm not sure, I wouldn't ever think of using informal speech with someone just because we're from the same place in the hierarchy or something. And going informal *just because* I'm higher in a hierarchy would be straight out against the social feeling of equality (it'd be like ""look, I'm higher in the structure, so it's *me* who decide how we talk"" - sounds extremely rude, doesn't it?).

But as I mentioned before, nowadays more and more workplaces use informal by default. Same for places like associations - joining one is an informal free time activity, so you'd rather go informal from the start too. Of course, in places with a lot of older people, you should be careful since growing up in different times, they may still expect formality in places you wouldn't anymore (the opposite is rarely the case).

>Are there any differences between Germany and Poland.

Hm 🤔 to me not on the baseline. After all, both countries are very close culturally, and I see the basic rules very similar. What stands out to me is the difference in how fast it changes. Germany is a bit further on the informal side of things, there're situations where you can just straight go informal, where it'd be still ambiguous in Poland. E.g. German neighbors may sometimes address each other informally the first time they meet - apparently, in their minds, living in the same building makes them close enough for it. I don't believe that could happen in Poland, at least not yet.

I'm not really sure where we're moving towards with it. Are we going to completely switch to informal at some point, or keep the formal speech in some situations? The first solution is often seen as something ""more modern"" (partially because of how strong anglosphere influences us nowadays). I personally would prefer the second option, maybe finally getting rid of all the old associations and making it strictly about ""how well we know each other"". That'd be a good compromise between tradition and modernity, I think 🙂",2021-06-19 10:20:56
o1a5c7,"Ah OK. If it was really confusing to the point where it leads to mistakes, I'd just use the full form like ""Herr Max Mustermann"". It sounds very formal but I'd still go with that instead of risking inpoliteness. But maybe I'm too Polish in this aspect 😂",2021-06-17 08:26:05

The general idea of race in my home country is that you're:
- black
- European
- Asian

South Asians and Middle Easterns are usually grouped with black people, and often referred to as so in a derogatory tone. Europeans are anyone who is pale or olive-skinned. And Asians are Thai, Korean, Philippines, Chinese, and Japanese.",2024-01-05 17:45:24
18yzk0c,"I am a European. The definition of a race that I have in my mind, is a group within a species that has certain bodily features that make the individuals in it distinct from the others. As such, what you call a race and what not, depends on which feature or group of features you have on your mind.

Can you tell a difference between a Russian and an English? They both (mostly) have white skin and yellow hair. Yet if you pay close attention, and have a look at enough English and Russian faces, you'll eventually be able to tell apart whether someone is Russian or English just by looking at their faces. Their cranial shapes are different. Similarly I can tell apart Slavs from Albanians, from Greeks, from English, from (some) Germans, from Hebrews, from (some) Egyptians. Do all of these belong to their own races? I'm not sure. But I can say that the criterion is met. (being able to tell apart sub groups of a species that have certain shapes, sizes, or colors of bodily features) 

Now as for the way Americans typically classify races, I find it weird. I mean how is Hispanic a race? Hispanic means speaking Spanish, that has nothing to do with bodily features. And what about ""Asian""? Asia is a continent, not a body feature. A continent that its indigenous peoples look rather different from each other. You have tanned Arabs and Jews at the Southwest of Asia, pale blonde Slavs at the Northwest, black haired but white Persians and Turks, brown Indians, wide faced Mongolians and yellow Chinese, long faced, pale, Vietnamese, Koreans and Japanese, brown people with slanted eyes in Thailand... I don't think that ""Asian"" is a race. Look how many diverse looking people live in Asia.
🙄

Similarly, in Africa, most people living north of Sahara aren't black. But even among those who are South of the Sahara and are black, they have their own local variations. Africans like the Ethiopians have thin faces and noses more like those of Europeans. Western Africans could pass for African American basketball players or rappers. Central Africans from places like Kongo, have prominent cheekbones which makes their faces look very wide.

There are lots of uniqueness and diversity in the world. Let's celebrate it.",2024-01-06 00:06:06
18yzk0c,"You can take a yellow/brown person like Victor Orban or Dua Lipa, put them in 10 European countries (called White countries by the US) or 10 west Asian countries (called Brown countries by the US) and they would look native in all of them. So yes, the imaginary divisions used by US politics don't make any sense. 

US Americans:
1) Call themselves just ""Americans"".
2) Call people with light brown skin, all the way to very dark brown as ""black"". In real life nobody has black color skin ◼️.
2) Call people with pink/brown, or yellow/brown, or pink/yellow skin as ""white"". Nobody has white color skin ◻️.
3) Call everyone from 10 Asian countries ""Asian"" and everyone from 10 other Asian countries ""brown"".
4) Everything that remains (Latin America, North Africa) is bundled with brown, even though they might be lighter than a Greek or a Spanish, and others might be darker than a mixed African American.",2024-01-05 21:49:59
18yzk0c,"Important note: those categories used in Europe are linguistic (and by extension cultural) categories. We would use Indo-European category instead of Caucasian. Indo-European is language category. Persian or Sankrit belong there too.  Slavic, Latin,👍 German are subgroups of Indo-European. Spanish and Portugese belong to Latin language group, therefore Latin America is extension of European culture too. 

Arabs and Hindus are ""brown"" in the USA. Hindus are Indo-European for Europeans and Arabs and other Semitic nations are in the middle between Europe and India, ""our"" civilization started in Semitic Egypt and Mezopotamia, it's not that far away.",2024-01-05 17:06:19

You in the US think about race 24/7, always wondering if you can wear [X] if you’re [X] skin color… I’ve even seen posts asking if a white child can have a black doll or if it’s inappropriate and cultural appropriation.

But to clarify, no one ever talks about what 'race' you are? Just nationality. So if someone asks me about identity, I'm just gona say ""I'm British"". I don't 'think' of myself as Caucasian as a signifier any more than I'd think of my grey eye colour as a signifier. It's not a fault line in Europe.",2024-01-19 08:33:37
18yzk0c,"What's funny about the ""Caucasian"" label is that people here do associate it with people from Caucasus, not, like whiteness. And to some (like my mom) ""Caucasian"" would mean someone with a darker skin tone and lots of dark hair 😬",2024-01-05 12:11:22
18yzk0c,"> Why would I be from Caucasus, a territory far away from me?

IIRC it comes from a piece of debunked racial theory from the 19th century that said that white people came from the Caucasus, or that people from the Caucasus are the archetypal white people, or some nonsense like that.

I've also never completely understood who counts as Caucasian and who doesn't. Ok so it's pretty clear Norwegians do, but what about Greeks? Turks? Iranians? When I joined my lab in the US I was told by the officer issuing my badge that they had me down as Caucasian. I'm mixed race, I never recall putting down my racial background on a form, and I look kind of Middle Eastern. Given that the area I live in has a large Armenian population, I assumed maybe he was suggesting I was from Armenia, but no, apparently I'm just a common or garden white person according to their official categories. So 🤷‍♂️",2024-01-05 13:24:59
18yzk0c,"European people are more xenophobic and classist than racist. In our culture we expect immigrants to ""integrate"" themselves and adopt the same ways as the people in the countries they immigrate to. Although this idea is becoming old and the culture about this has been changing for a few decades, this is what drives most of the discriminations here.


It doesn't mean people aren't racist. Races as seen by the Americans encompass ethnicities and ethnicities are often related to country of origin - some of them being notorious for having people migrants fleeing because of their country's poverty (don't forget classic). Human brains are made to create associations and people aren't blind. We don't talk about races and the consensus is that there isn't such thing as races, but it doesn't mean racial discrimination doesn't exist and that it doesn't (how oddly 🙃) somewhat match with the racial discriminations the American talk about.


USA is a wealthy country full of migrants coming from all over the world which culture is mostly made by European migrants. Hence why your colleagues are mostly seen by Americans, at least by those who actually talked to them and asked them.",2024-04-07 13:57:11

In Europe it’s more a question of language and culture than nationality, or origins.

And a large city in the south is a thoroughly planned industrial city, and one of the main functions of this city is to produce massive military weapons within a short period of time in preparation for military provocations such as NK and China. There are a lot of underground roads, tunnels, and air defense facilities in our cities, all of which were intentionally built in preparation for the war.

al0ej2,"🇭🇺 Hungary declaring war on the US in 1941. Not like the rest of WW2 decisions weren’t awful, but this one is actually funny. 
There is an anecdote about the situation (of course it didn’t happen, but very telling): 
So the aid goes to Roosevelt and declares war. He asks if Hungary is a Kingdom or a republic. Aid responds it’s a kingdom.
FDR: What’s the King’s name?
Aide: Hungary doesn’t have a King.
FDR: Then who runs the kingdom?
Aide: A Regent by the name of Admiral Miklós Horthy.
FDR: Admiral? Then Hungary must have a powerful navy.
Aide: Hungary has no navy; it doesn’t even have access to the sea.
FDR: Wars are often fought for religious reasons. What’s the main religion there?
Aide: Catholicism, Mr. President. But Admiral Horthy is Protestant.
FDR: Did this admiral declare war on us because of territorial claims then?
Aide: Hungary’s territorial claims are against Romania.
FDR: In that case, did Hungary declare war on Romania?
Aide: No, Hungary and Romania are allies.
FDR: Let me get this straight. Hungary is a  kingdom run by a Regent who’s an admiral without a navy, and it is  allied with Romania against which it has territorial claims but it has  declared war on the U.S. against which it doesn’t.

Hungary joined the Axis before, It was a formality to show loyalty towards Germany so Hungary won’t be invaded, but since Germany and Italy declared war too the ministry (behind Horthy’s back, and with some resistance from other members) decided we had to do it also. But Hungary also had armistice negotiations with the US, (and later with the Soviets) which actually resulted in occupation by Germany so let’s just say things were a ‘little’ chaotic back then. 🤷🏻‍♀️",2019-01-30 11:46:28

I would even argue that the cultures of European countries are not *that* different anyway. We all have a similar core of beliefs in the end (and I'm not talking about religion). It's not like Spain is burning witches at the stake and Finnland has a ministry of magic.",2019-12-16 13:47:29

In Latvia, the public transport system relies on these people that I call the ""Ticket gestapo"".

Rather than paying the bus driver, you can just hop on the bus here with no walking past the driver, or anything. You're meant to buy a card somewhere in the city, top it up, and scan it when you enter the bus. But most pedestrians just hop on for a stop or two and jump off.

The weird way that Riga city has handled this, is to employ officers with scanner guns to come onto the bus randomly and check if you've scanned your pass, which is impossible to buy on the bus itself.

If you haven't scanned, you get 30eur fine on the spot. I think to actually to that job you have to be a sociopath. It's such a backwards way of charging for public transport.",2020-03-16 13:51:07

n2d5kz,"You are observant! :) It's not every suffix, but every diminutive suffix (-chen and - lein) that is added to an a, u or o voweled word. I bet some exception do apply, but I cannot remember any meaningful ones. So it would be Hand - Händchen, Frosch - Fröschchen, Schnur - Schnürchen. That is a bit more complicated for combined vowels. Au will become äu, but eu won't become eü, and ei stays the same for lack of possible umlaut. So Haus - Häuschen, but Freund - Feundchen, Feind - Feindchen. Au can sometimes stay the same though, like in Auto, but I think that is because Auto in itself is a loaned syllable with its own meaning? That's just surmise. 

The Spatz issue: Spatz is a very common ""Kosename"", so more like a love name, all over Germany. I know many people from different regions who are called or call others Spatz, or at least are aware of the name. My best guess is that it was either popularised as a nickname through some sort of writing, like in a novel, or that it became popular because it is  very similar to another common love name, ""Schatz"", meaning treasure. People often use Schatz and Spatz interchangeably, with Schatz having more emphasis on your adoration for the other person, and Spatz having a more diminutive aspect. Often Men will call their girlfriends Spatz, or parents their daughters, but not the other way round.

 In general, nicknames for women tend to be small animals, like Maus (mouse), Spatz (sparrow), or Schnecke (snail, lol) or Hase (hare/rabbit), while nicknames for men tend to be more fun or provocative.

qeodn1,"Yes. Germany is definitely a country of shushers. Often people are too polite to even shush, so they might give you “The head turn” (if they’re in front of you), or simply “the look” ( “You are too loud!”).
   If that doesn’t help to bring the delinquent into pervasive, collective silence, silent muttering all over the audience will ensue.

   There even might be a few people who won’t stop at getting up from their seats (missing part of the movie) to denounce and inform on the non-conformant miscreant to the cinema manager (or sometimes just the popcorn guy if no one else is around).

   I’m just as annoyed at obnoxious people in movie theaters as the next guy, but all this sometimes really used to wake the rebel in me, provoking these people even more, if I thought my countrymen were too stingy or intolerant at that (or too allergic to “Fun”)

But now more to the heart of the matter, which I do know is a generalization of course, but here goes:

   I believe in English-speaking countries, and especially in North-America, people mostly tend to see the movie theatre as pure Entertainment (Think “Comedy performance”)

“I’ve come here to be entertained, and Entertainment I shall get - even if it’s gonna be myself cracking the jokes!”

while in European countries the cinema is seen much more culture related (Think “Museum”)
   The Audience is a lot more concerned with the message of the director, and the inner workings of the movie characters.

-> Thus, from this POV, it’s more understandable that European Audiences are more quiet and polite/reserved compared to Americans.

Even those Europeans who HAVE been to America usually saw NYC, Boston, DC or other  prominent East Coast places, OR LA, SF or Las Vegas. Sometimes Miami. But that’s usually it as far as tourism or visiting “Friends and Relatives goes.

So there’s many differences in culture and attitude, which Europeans are actually used to because countries IN Europe are so very different, having different languages and all.

Yea, English does that too! “I have on pants” is a perfectly valid way of saying “I’m wearing pants,” at least in my dialect! That’s the fun part of German, the cool similarities in phrasing.

As for anhaben: English does something similar. If you said “The storm has nothing on the ship,” it’d be understood as the storm was no match for the ship, implying it couldn’t damage it. Not exact, like before, but the relationship is there I think! We also do the literal “I have the AC on” meaning too, but I’m sure you knew that lol.

Then the difficult part of German: Why is “I have read the text” -> “ich habe den Text gelesen” but “I have misread the text” -> “Ich habe mich im Text verlesen” 😭

I’d expect verloren or verlaufen with that setup and context. The first is word for word, but then the second is “I have myself misread in the text” lmao.",2022-03-22 23:27:46
tjzo4u,"> I understood the meaning, but I have to deconstruct stuff like that and play with it before I can reproduce it in speech myself, and I want to more than just understand German haha.

Honestly, that's the best way to learn it. German has quite a few of those (and similar) idiosincracies (-sies?) that you'll get the hang of ... eventually. 

> That’s the fun part of German, the cool similarities in phrasing.

That's the cool bit - English and German share the same base language, so there's quite a lot of similarities like that! Then there's Dutch that just looks and feels like a frankensteined combination of German and English.

> “The storm has nothing on the ship,”

Oh yeah, that's a much better translation to show the similarity/help unterstand lol. 

> Why is “I have read the text” -> “ich habe den Text gelesen” but “I have misread the text” -> “Ich habe mich im Text verlesen” 😭

Excellent question! I don't know. ""to misread"" just means ""verlesen"" ... probably something about weak verbs already having a proposition and therefore not getting another one. You'll find that we don't know the rules to our language half the time ourselves and second language learners generally know them better.

The latter bit I don't really have an explanation for - except that we have four different cases and the examples all require Dativ (mich verlaufen/mich verlesen) which leads me to assume that ""constructed"" verbs like that all require the third case. ""verlieren"" isn't a constructed verb since there is no ""lieren"" (the antonym to ""verlieren"" is ""finden"") so it doesn't *require* Dativ. You can certainly still get lost in a text (or lose **yourself** in it, to really get to the meaning...), and ""mich"" can generally be translated as ""myself"".

btw there's also ""erlesen"", just to fuck with learners of German even more lol

Oh and ""handverlesen"" or ""von Hand verlesen"" also means hand picked.",2022-03-22 23:43:02

d84fhm,"Oh boy, where do I start... Since I'm a senior the biggest threat for me is that currently noone has any idea how the scoring works for the university application right now. There are certain rules that goes against each other.  Just this year for example they introduced that you must take a higher sat to be qualified to apply. Previously one higher sat meant extra 50 points, but now it worth nothing, and they didn't reduce the required scores. So for example if you want to become a doctor which already requires two higher sats in order to reach the requirements you must take a 3rd one- one that you might've never learnt, and you must prepare for that in your senior year. 
The other fucked up thing is that you can get extra points for different types of language exams. Not different level, just different type. So if you have an intermediate origo and an intermediate ielts for example, even tho they worth the same (except it's extra 60k huf,~180€, 200$) 
Oh, and an intermediate language exam is also a requirement, but most of the public schools are lack of English teachers right now, cause they are so poorly paid they either switch jobs, or goes abroad. 
And if all in all this wouldn't be so bad the universities won't hand out scholarships if you reach the required scores anymore. One term is going to cost 3M huf (~9k€, ~10k$). Of course the average Hungarian can't afford that especially if the law school for example lasts for six years. 
Ohh and the books are government censored.
Of course as you can see this system results in that the intellectuals who are not worshiping this system and won't get money directly from the government are most likely go abroad to do their studies. I'm lucky to attend one of the top schools and 60% of my classmates are planning to study abroad including me. 
So the intelrctuals who are against the current  leaders will leave the country, only those who have some kind of positive connections to them will be able to attend universities, and proper education in total, and the ones who can't... Well for them the only option remains is work that doesn't require much education like farming. Oh they also won't be able to get non government censored news from around the world cause they won't study other languages apart from Hungarian. This oddly reminds me of feudalism 🤷

mdjflz,"Draw a card. Stack of normal play cards, each colour had a punishment assigned to it. You drew the card with one hand, the other was flat on the table, the punishment was giving to the back of the hand.  ♠️ was a punch with the fist, ♣️ was scratching a cross with your nails (not drawing blood though), ♥️ was just petting the hand and ♦️ was the worst, it was pinching and twisting at the same time. Nobody ever won, we got bored and stopped after a few weeks when we realised hurting each other is dumb.

The coin against knuckles until blood flows was also popular for a short time but I didn't participate in that. I just watched the boys and told them they were idiots for doing it. They agreed at some point because I was always right. Ha!

NK is really a worst fanatic country. Kim Jong-un's mother was a half-Japanese, so Kim Jong-un is actually a quarter Japanese-Korean. However, to become the ruling class in NK, this ""dirty Japanese blood"" is a complete disqualification, so it thoroughly conceals the fact that Kim Jong-un is a quarter Japanese to the NK Communist Party, and NK citizens.

> Many people who call themselves ""socialist"" today are not suggesting the complete abolishing of capitalism and the market economy. So we're stuck with either calling them confused ""fake"" socialists - or to acknowledge that the term socialist doesn't have the same meaning today as it did 50 years ago. I think the latter is more constructive in terms of understanding politics. 

The problem with this is, that talking about people who aren't socialists, as socialists, only further entrenches the capitalist system that socialists supposedly oppose. Hence why anti-capitalism is a necessity for socialist positions. Otherwise we end up in the exact situation that Fukuyama called 'the end of history'. A complete faltering of progress. A society where the choice is either status-quo or reaction. Progress dies, when we start to, in this way, manufacture consent for capitalism within the socialist movement. If we accept that 'the latter is more constructive in terms of understanding politics', we effectively concede the playing field.

Capitalism must, by socialist, be opposed as the exploitative, alienating, and undemocratic economic system that it is. If socialists start to just be welfare-liberals+^^® ... Then the socialist struggle has definitively lost.

> We do not need to call the politicians themselves socialist to acknowledge that the reforms were a victory for a socialist struggle.

Not of a socialist struggle, but of a _class_ struggle. Hence why the label is misleading and shouldn't be applied. Socialism is the theory of class struggle. But struggles of the working class precede and prefigure the successive re-structurations _of capital._ This axiom has held true all the way back to Marx. But the goal of socialism isn't the re-structurations of capital, but rather, is the abolition of the capital _relation_ in its entirety.

The failures of the so-called 'great socialist experiments' of the 20th century, most of which befell either into totalitarianism, or collapsed into the capital relation again, were the reason for Fukuyama's vulgar thesis... but it only comes true if those of us who are socialists accept it. If we only take the lesson from the 20th century that 'socialism failed', with no nuance, and we then proceed to throw away struggle against the capital relation, struggle against class, struggle against capitalism. A better world _is_ possible. And the slogan of the worker's movement, labour union, parties, and of the autonomists should again be: ""We want _everything_!""",2021-02-19 10:57:51

m419xc,"Besides the obligatory CO2-footprint concerns a conscious consumer has, there are also other aspects I like to consider:

- Time: even if the plain might be faster when you just look at the time on board, it requires a whole long process beyond departure and arrival. You have to be there at least an hour before even boarding to go through security and after arrival, you often have to wait to. On top of that, the airport is alway outside the city, so you have to travel to get there in time (often by train 😉) and you have to travel again, after “arrival”, to arrive at your actual destination. So a 30 minutes flight, easily eats up most of you first day. A train trip starts in the middle of a city and ends in the middle of a city and you just need to be in time for departure.

- Comfort: on the train you have more space to sit and walk around. But this one might be more specific to me being 6’9 (207cm).

Is it the part that starts ""Oh mama-mia mama-mia"" that has the high note, you're referring to? because I can hit that note easily. As I said before, I am a woman so naturally have a higher singing voice than the average man, and the higest note in that song is certainly not unmanageable in any sense. It's high, but not that high. (I can hit the highest note on Beyonce's ""love on top"" without issue, I do enjoy singing). 

Obviously I don't have Freddie Mercury's singing ability, but their songs certainly are not hard to sing at all though. 

I'm definitely going to fling a bit of Queen on tomorrow and blast the housework lol, I make sure and play it so my son grows up hearing it often enough to know it lol, it's music his gran adores so I'd love for him to enjoy it too 🤞",2021-02-26 00:08:31

So at this point the an IRA group led by james Connolly organised a rebellion where they took over the General Post Office in Dublin, and raised an irish flag above it. This inevitably failed and the english retook the post office and captured the rebels.

They then took the rebels to Kilmainham jail and executed them one by one with a firing squad. James Connolly however was too injured to stand during his execution, so they propped him up on a chair and shot him like that.

The interesting part is that in the lead up to the planned rising, the rebels were seen as traitors who were risking Ireland's freedom, but after seeing their executions (especially james connollys) the irish people rallied behind then and all joined the fight for freedom and eventually led to independence.",2019-09-23 12:45:52

What we found crazy was crossing the roads. Just cars being over the crossing every now and then was something to get used to - it’s generally not a thing that happens in the UK. We didn’t travel on the subway as we didn’t feel the need to - we just walked everywhere. We do wish that we got a bus pass though to see Ground Zero and other things further away from us.

We went to Madame Tussauds, the Natural History Museum, Intrepid, Museum of Modern Art, Central Park, the Empire State Building and other stuff. The Natural History Museum was bigger than we thought, we spent the majority of the opening hours the day before we left, and felt like we needed more time as we didn’t get to see everything. It was massive.

Also, I took $500 and came back with $12 lol. It’s not cheap haha. I do want to go there again, hopefully within the next few years I’ll get the chance and money to go.🤞",2021-02-17 11:47:01

On the other hand, those who live near the capital tend to like it a lot because they managed to benefit from its special conditions.  

Lisbon is the center of everything in Portugal: political, economic, financial, business, scientific, cultural, artistic, tourist, etc.  A year ago the news came out that, once again, Lisbon was trying to divert European funds that were destined for the interior regions of the country (the most needy), this type of news is common. https://eco.sapo.pt/2019/10/02/ruas-critica-desvio-de-fundos-comunitarios-do-interior-para-a-gorda-lisboa/

As I asked another person here, I am gonna ask you the same, why aren't Moldova and Ukraine (to some extent) also included? Slavic countries, culturally similar and when you look at the map, they sure as hell are on the NE part of the peninsula. Because the Danube isn't a logical border, it is almost cutting the peninsula in half and is as arbitrary border as the Sava. Why isn't Drava then the border? 

But ok, if we are going by culture, are you seriously saying that Croatia and Turkey are in the same culture group? Ok, let's remove Turkey, but are Romania and Greece in the same culture group? Other than both being Orthodox, there isn't much obvious similarity between the two. 

If we are excluding Greece and Turkey as they aren't Slavic, why also not exclude Albania and Romania?

Then there's the ""linguistic high school"" (literal translation, sorry if that sounds bad 😂) where you also study French or Spanish (can't remember if both or you have to choose, if someone did this kind of school, please correct me!) and German. I think there might be other schools where you learn other languages, but I'm not sure. In case there are, if you did one of these school, please correct me!",2021-07-11 09:13:26

I used to teach my students with songs, film or video clips and tailored activities. Even if they weren't at B1 we certainly had way more fun during class.

This was because the crown of Castille consisted of [***several***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Castile) kingdoms. We were taught that one of the reasons of the inability of the Crown of Aragon to do much was due to the fact that it consisted of several kingdoms with conflicting interests... without mentioning that Castille *also* consisted of billions more kingdoms (plus the overseas kingdoms!). So apparently, Castille was this single cohesive unit that was efficient, where as Aragon was fragmented and chaotic. Right. (Can you tell I was educated in Madrid?)


E: context: I always found the politization of our history in the Catalonian education system very weird, “but at least they didn’t do the same here”.

It just never ceases to surprise with hidden architecture, views, little hip bars and cafés hidden behind a house that looks derelict, in some random side street in the Armenian quarter. I remember finding this place where you can see the brutalist concrete collosus of the Ministry of Defense through an archway of a posh early 20th century villa 👌 Also the parks are top notch, even if the place could use a few more.

z81amu,I will let her know 😂,2022-11-30 08:51:50
z81amu,">Like I said: Ventilation prevents mold in general because otherwise the humidity condensates, I think we can agree on that either. Especially because many (most?) people dry their clothes on a rack which makes the air more humid. Just take a hot and long shower and watch what happens on the window. I assume you open your window for 10 minutes too after that. That's exactly what stoßlüften is. 

Thank you for the clarification regarding Lüften. Although, when I read, for example, the Local etc, they seem to refer to the cultural phenomena overall as Lüften, as a particular German thing. See (for example) https://www.thelocal.de/20201001/lften-why-germans-are-obsessed-with-the-art-of-airing-out-rooms/

Nope. I have a small ventilation shaft in the bathroom. Now, it just happens that in my apartment it's not working very well, so we have som mould problems in the bathroom, but not anywhere else in the apartment. The landlord sees this as a bathroom ventilation problem but has been, let's say, slow, to fix it. 

In my old apartment I would even shower with the bathroom door open. I would not open a large window. But come to think of it I generally had the ventilation window (small bared window on the side) open, because the apartment was super small, so you'd get low CO2-levels fast and I also like sleeping in a cold room.

However, I haven't had my ventilation window open for a few weeks now. Never seen condensation on the window. I dry most clothes in the bathroom but a few in my bedroom 🤷‍♂️

>This is not about believing, I've never built a house in neither of these countries, so I don't have the knowledge about that. The only thing I know is that especially older houses were built with the premise that doors and windows let the air circulate (mostly using wood or even use ventilation holes in the windows), so that could be the difference or Sweden just uses more wood in their buildings or doesn't need to save heating costs that much because they have their own gas? Maybe also the humidity is different?

Found som article from 2003 that said that Swedish houses, on average, are the best insulated in Europe. While it's possible that Germany has caught up (saw something about new German building regulation being stricter than Swedish), given the huge amount of houses that are from the 60s to 90s, I'd say that it's highly unlikely that German homes, on average, are so much better insulated that it's relevant to the discussion. 

A huge majority of our apartments are not made from wood, though single family houses often are. We don't use gas for heating, we don't have any gas. Since the oil crisis it was decided that we needed to be as independent from hydrocarbons as possible.

Apartments usually use central heating (fjärrvärme) from burning garbage and single family houses have different solutions, but mainly down the whole heat exchangers (bergvärme), central heating, different versions of heat pumps and sometimes electrical heating. Boilers powered by say diesel occur, but is uncommon. 

Of what I found online, Swedish humidity seem to be slightly higher than Germany's. But I don't see why outside humidity should matter that much. I mean, isn't the argument that the humidity inside becomes too high? Not what it's outside. Autumn/winter air tend to have higher relative humidity, but it carries less overall water than warm air, so if you heat cold air, the humidity drops.",2022-11-30 12:34:32

1087ikl,"Many Slovaks believe that excessive drinking and being drunk is exclusively a Slovak thing… while literally almost every European country thinks that - the British, Czechs, Germans, Irish,… etc. It’s not unique at all and they always say it as if it were a good thing. As someone who doesn’t drink, I find it pathetic. Especially when I hear someone saying this as the first thing about Slovakia to foreigners who know nothing about our county. I think they’re just all giving us a bad name. 

Other things that I feel like are a bit more unique (but still horrible), is that most Slovaks (& Czechs too), believe our country is the worst country ever. They know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about 98% of the world yet they believe that it couldn’t be worse, that no other country has it worse than ours. You can often see it online like on social media (like tiktok for example), when someone visits Slovakia or god forbid moves here, all the comments are like ‘why would you move here💀’ or when someone says they visited and liked it, everyone is like ‘wtf💀 who could you like this horrible country’. This is something I’ve never seen any other nation doing. Most people don’t shit talk about their country that much, at least not to foreigners or tourists and are usually happy when tourists like it. It seems like Slovaks (and to some degree Czechs also) hate their own county. 

And one more thing that is kinda unique - as I’ve never seen it to this extent in any other places I’ve lived in. How envious and jealous Slovak people are. It seems like some people just can’t get over the fact that someone has more than them or that someone is richer than they are. When someone is rich, they automatic shit talk and hate that person and believe that they must be some kind of criminal or that they’re cheating on taxes or something. Yeah it’s not exactly easy to get super rich in Slovakia but it definitely CAN be done without doing illegal stuff. The most envious people are usually people who haven’t even finished high school or in general have low quality education and are lazy / not intelligent enough. I guess they just can’t accept that someone is smarter than they are (even tho almost everyone is). But basically I’ve never seen this amount of jealousy in any other country.",2023-01-13 09:14:12

We're posting all of those to satisfy our own curiosity.

Yeah if you're eloquent enough you can describe anything with multiple words but the beautiful thing is when a language creates a special term for something over time. 

E.g. my Polish language doesn't have distinction between Heaven and Sky (I know that it's the same German) or Earth and Ground. It is interesting that we historically didn't find the need to distinguish between them directly",2024-05-04 10:05:26

Teenage lingo that goes beyond our understanding, I guess. But Danes generally stress the thanking part a lot more than others, probably because we don't have a simple way of saying ""please"". We use phrases like ""tusind tak""/""tausend Dank"", ""tak for det""/""danke dafür"" (which can even be used in a negative way) and ""mange tak""/""vielen Dank"" a lot more liberally than a German speaker would.

We use quite a lot of English words regardless. There are some we don’t have proper equivalents for. “My **crush**” for example. You can say you have « un faible » (a weakness)/« un coup de coeur » (a heartbeat) for someone, but we don’t really have a word to refer to the person we like, so saying « mon/ma crush » became common amongst the youth. We’re more likely to talk about *coups de coeur* for things rather than people.

There are some words you’re likely to be “put back in your place” for, when the French word is already common and just as easy to use as the English equivalent. Like saying “mon **outfit**” when we have “ma **tenue**” that’s perfectly fine and easy to use already.

Do we want to talk about the ""fake construction"" that's done? 

How we've been sold out to China?

The massive immigration problem that's arrived because China is abusing the people they basically kidnap from other countries to take advantage of them here? 

How our own people can't find quality work here, so they get work visas for other countries to send money back so we can survive? 

Or the ability to bribe cops on the cheap for literally any nonviolent crime? 

I'm just scratching the surface, but you know. The usual.",2024-05-21 15:07:26

1cwyby7,"I think I need to preface this by stating that I definitely don't think Estonia was sunk by any submarine or some shit like that, it obviously sank because the front literally fell off.

That said, the way the question surrounding the recovery of bodies was handled was shameful. To institute some bogus ""ethical committee"" with some professor of ethics and a priest and what not to tell people that they should not want to recover their loved ones is so 1990s Swedish bully tactics in a nutshell.

**Relatives:** ""Could we please have the bodies of our loved ones so we can have proper funerals?

**Gov:** ""Ackshually we have this committee of experts on ethics who understand these things (i.e. *your own emotions*) much better than you do, and they say that it wouldn't be ethical to expose you to the state which the bodies will be in🙂""

**Relatives:** ""Actually, we're pretty sure we can, and in any case, why is that ***your*** decision to make?""

**Gov:** ""We believe in making expert decisions so that's why we put together this expert committee and the committee has decided that the most ethical thing is to let the bodies rest on the sea floor.🙂""

**Relatives:** ""But we disagree?""

**Gov:** ""That's understandable.🙂 You're emotional and not thinking rationally and are unable to take the decisions needed to protect yourselves psychologically.🙂 Thank you, this meeting is over, but you are free to submit your thoughts and feedback to our mailbox at

1cwyby7,"> we haven’t really heard any scandals in some time.

Oh, I disagree. There are plenty. To give you some examples:

- politicians selling Visas to Poland (and thus: entire Schengen zone) in Africa
- defraudation of over 68 million PLN by Sasin during the unrealised elections
- defraudation of over 200 million PLN by Szumowski during the pandemic (in a few separate scandals) and countless other purchases during the COVID19 that reek of defraudation (e.g. buying masks from a ski instructor of a notable government officials for 5 mln PLN which were absurdly overpriced and came with a falsified certificates)
- 10 million PLN which disappeared from the Central Anti-Corruption office in 2020, *still* noone knows what happen to this money
- politicians buying off land on which the CPK and the nuclear powerplants were supposed to be built, in order to later sell them to the government at much higher prices.
- The poisoning of the river Odra in 2022, which killed over 50% of the fish in the river, and conveniently - noone was seriously punished for that, while the government was actively trying to hide the poisoning from the public, and it wasn't until Germans raised the alarms that Polish public even heard about it. 

And so on, and so on... You surely have heard at a very least about the first two (🇵🇱  afera wizowa i wybory kopertowe), they are all over the media.",2024-05-21 11:19:09
