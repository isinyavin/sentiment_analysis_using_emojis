hnkkum,"I love how Trump’s main argument is purely deflection: “I closed the borders (meaning just the Chinese) and y’all said I was xenophobic.” 

Yes, he closed the borders to Chinese nationals. But still 400,000+ people from China (Americans and others) got back in. Plus, all of those other countries on the fucking planet!! And he ignored it for months... Too little too late. 

It’s like a lost cause with this guy. His talking points (which are all lies) never change. His cult base eats it up, but that’s only 36% of the electorate. Everyone else is like “dude, you’re an imbecile.”

In the days of Google, that logic has less weight. Anyone who is interested, and consumes somewhat non biased news will probably find out what it means. 

I mean, I totally understand what you mean, and that makes perfect sense in a perfect world, but we're on year 7 of Black Lives Matter with some people still not having a clue of what it means, despite a whole internet and a hundred news articles and explanations, etc. 

Ben Carson said earlier this week, “My personal feeling is, if those players were to come out and say, ‘We love our nation, we are patriots, we love our flag, we honor the memory of those who died to give us our freedom, but, we are protesting some of the brutality that has occurred, and that’s why we’re doing this,’ I think it would solve the problem.” 🤣 They've been saying that since day ONE. That's why people were mad at Drew Brees, because he's RIGHT there in the locker room and still acted like he didn't get it.

l6vdyt,318 SHARES @ $71 REPORTING IN AND NEVER LEAVING 🚀🚀,2021-01-28 15:32:09
l6vdyt,"For people who don't understand what's going on: Big hedge funds ""shorted"" 140% of Gamestop shares. WSB picked up on it and started buying those shares.

A ""short"" is essentially when you borrow a stock and sell it at the current price, hoping that the stock price will fall. When its time to return the stock you borrowed, you buy it at the new, lower price and pocket the difference. However, if the price goes up you are still required to buy it at the new, higher price, meaning you lose money. That 140% means that stocks were borrowed, sold, and then the new owner loaned it out again so that there are more shares ""owed"" than owned. The hedge funds are literally required to buy back more shares of the stock than there are in circulation, which would have been fine if Gamestop went bankrupt and those stocks were worth $0 (this is what they were hoping for in the first place, they would have made a bunch of money).

What's happening now is people are buying Gamestop shares because they know that hedge funds (Melvin Capital is the big one) are legally required to buy those shares back. That means that the people who own the shares can literally name their price and hedge funds will still have to buy, which is why the price is exploding.

hc26v2,"From a doctor:

""OK, here’s my rant about masks: I have spent the past 39 years working in the field of surgery. For a significant part of that time, I have worn a mask. I have worked with hundreds (probably thousands) of colleagues during those years, who have also worn masks. Not a single one us of became ill, passed out or died from lack of oxygen. Not a single one of us became ill, passed out or died from breathing too much carbon dioxide. Not a single one us of became ill, passed out or died from rebreathing a little of our own exhaled air. Let’s begin here by putting those scare tactics to rest!
(It is true that some people, with advanced lung diseases, may be so fragile that a mask could make their already-tenuous breathing more difficult. If your lungs are that bad, you probably shouldn’t be going out in public at the present time anyway; the consequences if you are exposed to Covid-19 would likely be devastating.)

“But”, you ask, “can’t viruses go right through the mask, because they are so small?” (“Masks keep viruses out just as well as a chain link fence keeps mosquitoes out,” some tell us.) It is true that individual virus particles can pass through the pores of a mask; however, viruses don’t move on their own. They do not fly across the room like a mosquito, wiggle through your mask like a worm, or fly up your nose like a gnat. The virus is essentially nothing more than a tiny blob of genetic material. Covid-19 travels in a CARRIER – the carrier is a fluid droplet- fluid droplets that you expel when you cough, sneeze, sing, laugh, talk or simply exhale. Most of your fluid droplets will be stopped from entering the air in the room if you are wearing a mask. Wearing a mask is a very efficient way to protect others if you are carrying the virus (even if you don’t know that you are infected). In addition, if someone else’s fluid droplets happen to land on your mask, many of them will not pass through. This gives the wearer some additional protection, too. But, the main reason to wear a mask is to PROTECT OTHERS. Even if you don’t care about yourself, wear your mask to protect your neighbors, co-workers and friends!

A mask is certainly not 100% protective. However, it appears that the severity of Covid-19 infection is at least partially “dose-dependent.” In other words, the more virus particles that enter your body, the sicker you are likely to become. Why not decrease that volume if you can? “What have you got to lose?!”

“But doesn’t a requirement or a request to wear a mask violate my constitutional rights?” You’re also not allowed to go into the grocery store if you are not wearing pants. You can’t yell “fire” in the Produce Department. You’re not allowed to urinate on the floor in the Frozen Food Section. Do you object to those restrictions? Rules, established for the common good, are component of a civilized society.

“But aren’t masks uncomfortable?” Some would say that underwear or shoes can be uncomfortable, but we still wear them. (Actually, being on a ventilator is pretty darned uncomfortable, too!) Are masks really so bad that you can’t tolerate them, even if they will help keep others healthy?

“But won’t people think I’m a snowflake or a wimp if I wear a mask?” I hope you have enough self-confidence to overcome that.

“But won’t I look stupid if I wear a mask?” I’ve decided not to dignify that question with an answer!! 🙂

“But I never get sick; I’m not worried.” Well, then, wear a mask for the sake of the rest of us who are not so perfect!

There is good evidence that masks make a real difference in diminishing the transmission of Covid-19. Please, for the sake of others (and for the sake of yourself), wear your mask when in public. It won’t kill you!

P.S. - And, by the way, please be sure that BOTH your nose and mouth are covered!""",2020-06-19 17:58:47

I mean, my company's network MITMs everyone ""for security purposes"" (lol) and they even had to get people to install root CAs on their own machines. They did eventually end up pushing down a group policy to add the CA that worked in IE and Chrome, but not Firefox. And still, that's basically physical access with extra steps (have to join it to the domain to get the policies).

Over time it seems to get harder and harder for users to even _manually consent_ to a MITM.

>PSA; ALWAYS ASK ABOUT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE! Seriously. The standards for healthcare assistance aren’t the same as they are for federal/state assistance. **If you’re not making like $100k annually then you’ll probably qualify for some sort of reduction or assistance program. You usually have to ask for them and sometimes search them out. However, if you’re just going to pay your bills, they’ll just let you. I’ve seen it happen too many times to count. They are not trained to offer them.** I offer them to everyone because fuck paying the healthcare system but not everyone is as enthusiastic about it. Talk to the medical provider, talk to your insurance provider, find another route of financial compensation.

This meant I would have been paying all of her medical bills out of my pocket, and I was barely making ends even meet at the time.

Our only option was to get divorced and separate our finances. Once we did that, she qualified for Medicare. That’s when we discovered that Medicare was only supported by crappy doctors.

a9e864,"Here’s to dads being more involved in 2019. It’s honestly a win win for everyone when that happens. 

Edit: I’m not saying all dads do nothing for Christmas. However, in my experience men tend to be less involved in the operational stuff - cooking, decorating, gift buying/wrapping, etc. Same goes for general family life but that’s a conversation for another day. So yes, here’s to more sharing of family responsibilities by BOTH partners. Talk to your husband/wife. Find out what works for you guys.

k1eit3,"Rules of engagement.
1. Buying a drink entitles you to nothing. Not even a conversation.
2. Listen to body language. When a girl turns away or takes a step back, it doesn’t mean come closer, it means f&@k off.
3. Unsolicited dick pics are sexual harassment.
4. Take a f&@king hint. Just because someone is polite to you, doesn’t mean they want to sleep with you.
5. Don’t hit on women in the gym. You’re only the 100th guy who has interrupted their workout.
6. Girl: “I have a boyfriend”. The only acceptable response to this is “ have a good evening” and walking away. Anything else is 🤮",2020-11-26 19:08:52

I had told the bartender that a guy who had just gone to the restroom was aggressively ruining my night, and I didn't really want to leave yet because it was my 22nd birthday and already sucked. He wanted to help but his girlfriend was there and had made a point of making out with him frequently to ward off women... so he made up a story about a mutual friend and invited me downstairs (staff area.) 

The idea was to wait the guy out, hoping he'd leave. He didn't until almost the end of the night, so the bartender tried his best to salvage my night by bringing me free drinks.

I had left my jacket over the bar stool... My car keys were in it. By the time it was safe to come upstairs, the keys were gone. I knew immediately they were stolen, but to this day I don't know who wanted to spite me worse- the guy who waited all night or the jealous girlfriend. *Both* were gone, and the bartender said his gf didn't believe he was just trying to be helpful.

He did make sure my car didn't get towed while waiting to get re-keyed, and helped me vainly search the place just in case. 

I sort of felt worse for *him*- no good deed goes unpunished, and I know he felt guilty that he might have been the reason AND his gf undoubtedly compounded it 🙄",2020-12-17 08:30:21

It could have been avoided if I wasn't so unassertive 🙄 I tried just telling a guy I wasn't interested **one** time.

>Wow. Jesus. This is... really, really thorough. Thank you for putting in all this hard work.

>When I was a teenager, I spent a lot of time on /b/, /pol/, 888chan, etc. It was a slow descent and I didn't even realize what was happening until it was almost too late.

>But during my time on the other side, this was 100% the gameplan. They'd make ""sock puppets"" and coordinate on the board + IRC (showing my age here) to selectively choose targets to brigade.

>Depending on the target, you'd either have some talking points to ""debate"" (sometimes with yourself/other anons working alongside you) or you'd go in there guns blazing trying to cause as much damage/chaos as you can. However, even then you can't go out there yelling slurs (you'd just get banned instantly); you have to maintain some level of plausible deniability by framing things as ""jokes"" or thought experiments.

>You purposely do bad-faith arguments because the time it takes for them to dig up sources and refute you is longer than it takes for you to make stuff up. You can vary how obvious the bad faith argument is; when you want to troll you make very stupid claims (I once claimed I was a graduate of ""Harvad University"" and when people assumed that I meant ""Harvard"" I would correct them right down to Photoshopped images).

>When you just want to cause dissent you do exactly what those /pol/ screenshots do: you get to a thread early (sometimes you even make it yourself) and present reasonable-sounding arguments which are completely false if anyone bothers to look into them. If someone does, you bury the message under strawmen, downvotes, reports, and sockpuppets.

>So yeah. The tactics have evolved slightly, but I still recognize them. Props to you on doing the digging to find all this stuff and bring it into the light.

>I doubt that it'll help in the majority of cases, mind. People on Reddit have already made up their mind. You want to go after the forums and BBSes, on the MSN News comments and whatnot. Even so, the more people who are aware of the tactics the more people who can call them out.

zz0k27,"😮 All these posts, besides some being all over the pages, started with a commenter citing Jesus supposedly saying he came to turn man against other men & their families and now it has wandered over to trash talking Republicans. The points I want to make are:
1) there are good & bad in everything, that includes  these top two, Politics & Religions.
2) anything can be taken to the extreme and that, in turn, goes sour. Can anyone agree that too much of a good thing will turn good into not so good. It's called extremism. Even the best intententions go awry. And that is what I see this thread is devolving into. Not saying that voicing opinions is wrong, it's right to do so. All people have some kind of bias towards someone or something, no matter how open-minded they are. I, myself, am unashamedly biased against chosen stupidly.   I say ""chosen"" because the ability to explore the other side of what they believe is there. I approach every issue, every person from the middle of the road, at times what I feel to be right or wrong turns out to be tha opposite. This has actually caused me to be skeptical of everything, therefore along the way, I have learned a lot. 
So, would you say this post is all over the page? That's how I felt reading the comments. There was a common thread however, as a group everyone is so full of bias towards Republicans, plain as the nose on your face. We can all learn something from each other, #1 being tolerant of others instead of condemning immediately based on a person's political party. Maybe I'm an anomaly, however being a registered Republican I do embrace certain Democrat lawmakers. It's all about deeds vs words. My top bias would be against Nancy Pelosi. Her words are in support of the less fortunate, yet her actions say she is all about the wealthy. With her power why isn't she pushing her fellow Dems leaders to put the money where mouth is. Why are there still Ghettos or substandard schools, (especially the inner city schools), with old textbooks that were meant to be trashed.

And most of them want it to happen so Trump can take his ""rightful"" place as president. I have to admit it was fun watching them trying to reason out what was happening when he announced his run for 2024 lol.

vxt9xr,Yes it literally is their job to die in place of innocent citizens you fucking dunce. To serve and protect. It means laying their life on the line to protect (possibly dying in the process) and serve the citizens. It literally is their job to die in the line of duty.

vxt9xr,Well obviously they weren't trained well enough to keep these kids from getting killed so 🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ they also can't protect anyone if they choose to just fucking stand around and not do shit you fucking moron. again it's their job to die in the line of duty.  if you don't understand that I don't know what the fuck to tell you. They signed up to go into deadly situations. If they can't handle the job and the description of the job that they signed up for (dying to PROTECT innocent citizens) they shouldn't fucking be cops. Keep deep throating that boot bud.,2022-07-13 11:28:01
vxt9xr,"And if it's not their job to die in the line of duty to protect innocent citizens (it is) then they should probably stop saying that they ""protect and serve"" the people then. From what I've seen they don't do either of those things. They don't protect citizens they let them get killed (as shown by this event) or they kill them (as shown in the many unnecessary shootings of unarmed citizens) and they don't serve citizens either. They demand respect when they haven't even fucking earned it and if you don't give them unearned respect they treat you like a piece of shit and don't even try to help you. They think they are more important than anyone else and think they can do whatever the fuck they want. All of these cops are pieces of shit and deserve to be fired and charged with not doing their job and letting kids get killed 🤷🏼‍♀️",2022-07-13 11:38:50

 again protect and serve it's their job. if you don't like it I don't know what to tell you. these dumb motherfuckers shouldn't have ever been allowed to be cops. they should've been working at McDonald's or some shit like that because they obviously don't have the balls to be cops. 

Also, there were like dozens cops. You're telling me that's not enough ""reinforcement"" for them to take out ONE (1) kid with a gun? The unarmed parents didn't have any trouble running in to get their kids without reinforcement.

Do you really think $10 billion corporations are volunteering to collect donations for charities?

Oh, they're so nice!

No - they get tax breaks. Any money they collect and donate comes off their bottom line in the form of tax breaks. It literally helps their bottom line. 

That's why *everyone* is doing it, now.

It may be a cynical view of the world, but no, a corporation will never do something out of the kindness of their heart. At the very least, that's good marketing. But the truth is, they get tax breaks.

EDIT:

Okay, apparently there's websites out there that claim Walmart doesn't do this, lol

Sure, uh huh, I trust Walmart 😉

At the very least I was right about the first part in my post:

Every cashier was given a roll of tickets and customers could buy as many scratch-offs as they wanted.

There was a large prize out there, I believe a few thousand bucks, but it was a chain of stores and I’m not sure which got it. But it was at least *fun* for customers and gave them incentive to play as well as donate. Asking on a screen is just plain lazy.

Weird thing though… it was legal? There was no age range to purchase these literal scratch off tickets? Like, we handed these out to kids who came in to buy candy after school if they wanted them. I guess it slipped by as “charity donations” but we were essentially allowing children to gamble lol.

He took a state that he won in 2018 by less than a point and won re-election by almost 20. He Turned Florida from GOP +<1% and turned it into GOP +20 in the course of one election cycle. Those aren’t just republicans all of a sudden showing up to vote. Those are independents and moderate dems switching parties at least for one election.

Just adding that, trying to stop assholes by acting like assholes isn’t probably the best solution either. We can think and enact justice  *responsively* instead of *reactively*. Reactively being the way which leads to further tearing down other people’s  humanity.

Much the same way some Governors did with bussing migrants around the country (against their will) as a political stunt. Political stunts are just part of the system...but using ***other people's lives*** purely for ""Internet Attention | IE: Nothing""? It's pretty sinister behavior. 

I really hope they realize it in hindsight, then take steps to correct it. Not delete it, but **cite** it as a way of charting personal growth. I frequently chart my past ignorant beliefs as a bullet point on my journey to being more empathetic. It will hopefully inspire others to feel safe enough to reciprocate. All of us sharing those types of stories will only make us more socially conscious. Who knows what ignorant belief you might share with someone, but now the wool has been lifted because of one of these stories? But, few are willing to brave the embarrassment of it. 

I attempt to avoid judging a person *themselves*. I choose to assume we simply don't see the issues from the same angle. I simply ask them to consider the question; ""What evidence could you imagine, that would make you change your views on the subject?"". I ask myself the same question, openly. But, even if I don't agree with someone, I still try to understand their motivations. Usually (barring severe mental illness) people feel they are just trying to ""get by"".

I wonder what her attitude would have been if it had resulted in a pregnancy.)

I donate to charities (except that shelter because I didn’t want the fucking employees using it) all the time. I always say yes if I am asked to donate my change. I buy those food bags at the store around holidays. I donate things to the local women’s shelter all year. My aunt never donates to anything. She’s greedy and selfish.

The cousin who is 2 years younger than me wouldn’t exist if she hadn’t have been jealous my dad’s family was giving him and me attention after my parents struggled for 10 years to get pregnant. She’s a real piece of work. But sure. If there’s a heaven, she will definitely go because she shows up to church and hates anyone they tell her to and I will rot in hell for loving everyone and being kind. Whatevz. 

The point is, yes. Church people are usually the worst. I am pretty sure they feel like the can be however they want because they show up to church every Sunday so God will forgive them. 🙄",2020-10-16 01:07:38
jbs2ep,"Years back my sister worked at a breakfast restaurant that was only open until 2pm. This church crowd came in at like 1:55pm with about 15 people. They made an insane mess and tried to stiff my sister’s friend who was waiting on them. The manager comes out and happily tells them there’s a minimum gratuity for groups of a certain size that they have to pay. They got super pissy saying it was a scam that they had to pay it. 

They were sitting around drinking drinks chit chatting until like 3:20 and looked like they had no plans on leaving anytime soon despite the staff waiting for literally only them to leave so they could go home. Manager had hinted to them that they were closing up and other customers had been gone a long time. They still didn’t seem to care so my sister put on Marilyn Manson music incredibly loud and the people immediately complained but they told them it was controlled by corporate headquarters and because they close at 2pm they couldn’t call them to change it 😂 and the assholes immediately left and never came back.",2020-10-16 02:20:20

hbd6z2,"Copying and translating from the German Wikipedia 😅

In March 2012, the City Council of Münster decided to rename Hindenburgplatz to Schlossplatz.  Appropriate initiatives had repeatedly failed in the post-war decades, most recently in 1998. A referendum against the council decision was ultimately unsuccessful; in a referendum in September 2012, almost 60 percent of Münster voters refused to rename the square to its old name of Hindenburgplatz. [  35]

 In Ludwigsburg on July 30, 2015, the submission of the city administration to rename Hindenburgstrasse failed due to the rejection of the CDU parliamentary group, the group of free voters and the city council of the Republicans.  In addition, a city council of the FDP rejected the submission. [36]

 In 2014, the city of Hanover appointed an advisory board of experts to check whether there was “active participation in the Nazi regime or serious personal acts against humanity” for people who gave the streets their names.  He suggested the renaming of the street named after Hindenburg.  According to the advisory council, Hindenburg had ""paved the way for Hitler to power and supported all of Hitler's political measures.""  This could not be put into perspective by the fact that Hindenburg was “no longer in control of his decisions” because theories in this regard were refuted. [37] [38]",2020-06-18 14:07:38

Then why aren't you protesting too? 

It's because they're racist and don't actually care, that's why.

""All lives matter"" = I wish to ignore issues specifically affecting black people because I'm racist.

EDIT: No need to reply with ""all lives matter"" or some other equivalent racist BS. I'll just block you. Just downvote me and move on. I'm all for open dialogue, but I'm done acknowledging unabashed racists. And don't tell me ""all lives matter"" isn't racist. It is in this context, and you know it is.

EDIT: This is kind of nice. Some of the replies I'm getting are allowing me to easily weed out the proud racists so I never have to hear from them again on Reddit. They even give me a little entertainment by trying to convince me that they're not racist and that ""all lives matter"" isn't a direct racist response to BLM. They still go bye bye. Btw, I absolutely am racist as in I make subconscious unintentional snap judgements based on race thanks to societal conditioning. I'm trying my best to unlearn what I have learned.

EDIT: There are 4 kinds of people in western society.

1. Proud bigots. You know who you are. Nazi tattoos. Confederate flags. Hopefully you'll all die off eventually.

2. People who try to convince themselves they're not racist. These people will say things like ""all lives matter"",  ""I don't see color"", and ""I have a black friend, he's actually nice"". These aren't necessarily intentionally bad people, but they're still racist. You'll get the most push back from these people trying to convince you they're not racist.

3. People who admit they're racist but are trying their best to unlearn that behavior.

4. People who aren't racist at all. They make absolutely no race based judgements, ever, for any race. They never have and they never will. These people are imaginary and don't exist.",2020-08-13 15:51:50

https://youtu.be/U6w9CbemhVY

Your votes don't matter. It's A big game to make the masses believe they hold power that they don't really hold. America is not A democracy, it's an oligarchy. Trump was part of that oigarchy long before he ran for president. You fell for two lifelong friend's running against each other for president like they magically woke up one day and decided the multiple generations of their families being friends never happened. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

Humans in general, no matter where they're from, what country, state, province, territory, no matter what language, etc, humans are more alike than different. Shhhh don't tell the astrology people, but that's why horoscopes work, because we're all alike. We feel the same emotions, experience many of the same tragedies, want the same things for ourselves and our families, etc, etc, etc. We all agree on more things than we disagree as well, we're just stupid enough to let the elite divide us with the few things that do set us apart from each other.

Obviously I'm just making up A random guesstimate, but we basically don't do the 95 things we do agree on because we're too busy arguing about the 5 things we don't agree on because that's what they told you to be mad about. We allow the elite to convince us that the 5% we disagree on is more important than the fact we agree on 95% of issue's. 

It doesn't matter if you're left leaning, right leaning, far right, far left, independent, centrist, etc, etc, if you even believe the system is legitimate, you're being played and lied to. You have Stockholm syndrome if you support any piece of our government. They ""legally"" allow bribery and call it ""lobbying"", there's nothing legitimate about our government. It's there to keep the elite in power and slowly bleed us all dry no matter who is the president, who has the house, or who has the senate, it doesn't matter, we still get fucked because none of them care about us.",2022-11-10 00:35:39

I knew kids that were constantly made fun of but they were too confident to care, bc they understood what others didn’t... your pre-adult social life doesn’t *have* to matter that much lol.

s422m3,"I agree with the idea that isolated students do get in that position because of some sort of trait and some of the harder ones to deal with relate to undiagnosed or poorly managed mental conditions. 

I remember this girl in my HS who was pretty isolated and dogged and made fun of by others and having been bullied or isolated in previous schools I attended so I didn’t mistreat her and did interact with her whenever she did reach out to me. Thing is she’s definitely on the autism spectrum because she had no filter and no ability to read a room. And since she was smart, when she got on a subject area she would monologue. 

Thanks to social media I know that She’s *still* like this. She has few friends and even fewer interactions on her profile and because I didn’t block her and do interact with posts (which do align to personal or professional interests of mine) she will occasionally text or call me. Nothing she’s ever done or said has been problematic to me to warrant having a conversation or blocking but the funny thing is I continue to be nice and polite so has gone on for years now.

s422m3,"Been here too with an ex best friend turned biggest bully. I’m so sorry you ever had to experience that type of rejection. It’s truly an awful feeling. My though is, is if you’re inviting MOST of the class, including acquaintances, then you should invite everyone so as not to leave anyone out. But on the other hand, if you’re only inviting a few close friends, lots of people aren’t invited and you aren’t the only one left out- I think this realistic idea of levels of close friends is totally something kids should be taught growing up. Also, just don’t be an asshole. That’s the main thing.

There was a brief second when I stepped out into the rain and wet pavement barefoot freezing from the rain. I thought about running.  Run & run & maybe a car hits you & it's all over. 

I waddled inside. Sat on the chair and just zoned out . Dead eyed . The officers told them I was a suicide watch . They asked me & I just said I was tired and wanted to sleep. 

I didn't not until intake was done. And I spoke to a ""doctor"" who gave me meds to chill out. Guess what was playing on the TV? Halloween . 🎃  

Well after waiting and waiting and asking for food or to sleep. I finally see one. Tries to arrange therapy when I get out and gives me a month supply of idk what. 

On day 3 we all hopped in a white van as they all drove us home. 

I cried , my family cried. I'll never forget that afternoon my mom in tears just wishing I got the help I needed .

It's been a grueling 5 years but I can happily say I'm on the path to healing . I work at it every day . Baby steps,  I appreciate how far I've come and I give myself the recognition I deserve. 

I really hope she can get the love & care from both her parents & her entire family that she deserves. 

Regardless of who her father is she doesn't deserve to suffer because of his flaccid existence.",2022-12-07 09:47:14

lndqod,"Here’s the thing, I work in the medical field and I have what would be considered “good health insurance”

My insurance is $500 a paycheck, so $13,000 a year. 

My insurance doesn’t cover anything until I meet my $3,000 deductible. 

So I must spend $16,000 out of my pocket within a year before my insurance starts covering anything out of their pocket. What do they cover you may ask? They cover 80% and I am responsible for the other 20%. Mind you, this is after I paid them $16,000 already. 

And that’s if they even fucking approve it. They get to look at the bill and say yea we’ll pitch in 80% or say no thanks. Spoiler alert, they say no thanks a fucking lot. 

So my point is, even if they raised my taxes $16,000 a year on top of the 25% in taxes I already pay I WOULD STILL BE BETTER OFF than I am now if I never saw a medical bill again. 

Problem is, Americans can’t get their head out of their ass and get over the notion that “I dOnT WaNt mY mOnEy tO pAy FoR sOmEoNe eLsE”. Like I get it, I don’t want to give my money to someone else either but at the end of the day I’m literally throwing away $16,000 a year. The insurance is so shit I’m literally throwing it away. So even if my taxes went up $16,000 a year but I never saw a medical bill again I would still be wayyy better off than I am now, so fucking what if that also benefits someone else, it’s also benefitting you fucking greatly. But go ahead, keep throwing your money in the fucking trash so you can go to sleep knowing at least it didn’t help someone else 🙄",2021-02-19 15:00:45

Besides, it's not 50 percent immediately off your paycheck here. It's 25-30. The rest are added afterwards, which means you pay only the taxes for what you spend on.

Not saying I'm against universal health care not saying I'm for it. Idk what's the best solution here but this guy is full of shit.",2021-01-21 19:48:41

we're the good guys from the marvel movies and Republicans are Thanos!!!

That's hecking wholesome 💯",2021-01-21 17:56:07
l1wr7d,"If you're paying only 1% of your income to your premiums, you're making over 100,000 a year (unless you are paying less than $85 a month for your premiums - and if you are paying that little then your employer pays more of it than most, or you have shitty insurance that doesn't cover much other than catastrophic injuries - and only after you shell out of pocket a ton first). So, maybe middle class, but still in the top 20% of earners in the US. 

But that isn't including deductibles, copays, prescriptions, etc that are costs above your premium if you ever needed to use your health insurance. 

Lastly, yeah, unemployed or self employed people will pay 4x or more what you pay because your employer subsidizes your insurance, so something else to consider. 

But I feel where you're coming from. I worked for one of that largest banks in the world with great health insurance, and figured ibwas covered. Then my partner got cancer bad. We paid almost nothing out of pocket in the end (other than the extra I put into our HSA). BUT, that wasn't because our insurance was so great, it was because, even with my awesome insurance and HSA and flex funds that bank put in for me, we still owed over $30k for out of pocket expenses that insurance wouldn't pay over 2.5 years. Only we were able to find some grants that helped pay that off for us. So basically, WITH health insurance and saving for ab emergency, I still needed a handout to pay my medical bills. That, to me, a sadly messed up system. 🤷‍♂️",2021-01-21 20:19:32

The other 2 are hiding under the bed occasionally getting run into by the cat and promptly becoming even more terrified because the cat is insane right now running 15-20mph(?

It’s a valid question, even for people like me who have passed college political science courses and know the basics of how our government works.

Maybe I’m ignorant regarding some system that has been around for ages, maybe this is a new thing.  That’s why I asked.

Edit:  I found the real answer.  60 votes is, of course, not a supermajority.  It’s never required to pass bills.  It’s just the arbitrary number needed according to “The Senate cloture rule” from 1917 to prevent potentially unending filibusters that can prevent a bill from being passed. 👍",2022-12-02 02:39:54

It's pathetic to lie about your height for whatever reason. In this case he isn't lying. He's got got a choice of saying either 5'11 or 6'0.  
Anybody with half a brain cell knows 6'0 is closer his height , add to that 6 is far easier to say.  Very strong case for 6.

You've *already* paid your taxes throughout the year, it comes out of your paycheck. How much came out was dependent on what you claimed on you W4.

What your determining in April is if you paid *enough*. If you claimed less than you could've on your W4 then you (probably) paid to much in taxes and the govt owes you it back. You got a return! Yay!

If you claimed too much on your W4 (you can really go hog on that thing, knew folks that had 99 claims, paid very little taxes *from their paycheck* but...) then you probably didn't pay enough and you owe some more. ☹️

The govt actually *doesn't* know this value because they *don't* know (maybe they do, who knows) your total earned income for the year. They *do* know how much you've paid in taxes.

xxx955," 🤔 Doesn’t matter most of them aren’t charged at a Federal level for possession, the majority of people have State charges for possession. So unless a State changes their law to the new Federal law, they are still fucked. 🤣😂🤣

https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp

Federal Prisoners with drug Offenses 66,903 45.2%

Now out of those, how many have simple marijuana possession charges you think are in Federal prison 🤣. It’s going to be super duper low. People don’t go to federal prison for simple marijuana possession, they go to State prisons. You’d basically have to get caught on Federal property, serving some kind of Federal job and caught or get caught in Federal prison with marijuana to get hit with Simple marijuana charges federally.

https://www.prisonpolicy.org/graphs/pie2022_drugs.html

State prisoners Nation Wide with drug offenses make up 374,000 of prisoners. These are the main people who are going to be serving time for simple marijuana charges.

So yeah let people think they are getting off for Federal simple marijuana possession when they have State simple marijuana charges are delusional. Only way is if the State they were charged in changes the law and rescinds their existing charges.",2022-10-08 02:11:40

Masks are required,  and i scooch myself up against the wall to be the furthest away from where the server will be at the end of the booth table.  I've had covid,  so I'm not worried about me right now as much as the potential that i still carry the virus.
Up here,  we can eat inside now,  but there are very stringent regulations in places regarding masks and distancing. Every other table in the diner has a big ""do not use"" sign taped to it,  and the booths alternate sides,  so the table across the aisle is a ""do not use"" too.

2023 MEDICARE PART D INFORMATION - IRA

Inflation Reduction Act

Effective January 1, 2023, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) requires Medicare Plan Sponsors to eliminate the deductible and impose a statutory maximum beneficiary cost-sharing of $35 per one-month supply for Medicare Part D covered insulins. In addition, the IRA eliminates the deductible and imposes a $0 cost- share for Medicare Part D covered adult vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

IMPORTANT: Pharmacies should be aware that the IRA provides Plan Sponsors a grace period of ninety(90) days through March 31, 2023, to implement the beneficiary cost-sharing maximum of $35 per month for Medicare Part D covered insulins. As a result, Part D Enrollees may be temporarily required to pay a cost- share higher than the $35 maximum per month for covered insulins through March 31, 2023. CVS Caremark® is prepared to implement the correct cost-sharing requirements for the IRA, however, there may be a small number of scenarios where Part D Enrollees may be charged a cost-share higher than the $35 maximum per month for insulin claims.

&#x200B;

This was from an email we received from Caremark, one of the 3 largest insurance companies. Enrollees are supposed to be reimbursed within 30 days, but I wouldn't hold my breath. 

Another thing to consider, some of the more common injectables for diabetes aren't actually ""insulin"", so they will be exempt from this new law. Ozempic, Trulicity, Victoza. nope, not likely covered under this act.  (Haven't seen this in writing, but I know how loopholes work...and I hate insurance companies)",2022-12-27 02:51:36

It’s not though. That crime is not based on racism, and it’s not being done by *government officials.* I get that it probably kills more people, but there’s a difference between being killed by a random person and *being killed by the person you’re calling to protect.*

Everyone agrees that it’s a problem and needs to be solved. But it’s simply not the same issue, and I and many other people believe that Let’s make sure the people that we rely on to protect us won’t murder us for our skin color, and then we’ll focus on the citizens. 

> Oh well I guess that's enough lmao. ""I can't be a hypocrite because that problem is already being addressed by solutions that haven't worked in the decades they've been in place"". 🤣

You know, it’s disappointing. I was hoping to have a good faith conversation about this. But you’re putting words in my mouth for some reason. 

I never said it was enough, and I never said that this is the reason why it’s not hypocrisy. It would be hypocrisy if the BLM were donating to the racist union leaders, or if they themselves were beating black people based on the color of their skin too, but not for protesting other people being racist. 

I said that there are people fighting for better programs. These programs often have to be compromised because republicans usually vote against social programs.

In a country of over 300 million people only 9 black people were killed by police last year. Out of the 9... 5 of them were proven to be justified because the person was armed and risking the officers or other innocent people’s life. 2 of them were from high speed chases and 2 were unjustified and they were charged.

Just because it’s “legal” doesn’t mean you’re not damning yourself into your own personal hell. But hey, since you have the “choice” to kill a child or not it’s ok to roll the dice and fuck raw and give yourself away. Never mind STD’s and “saving yourself” for someone special.

jrbvr3,"I work in health insurance here in Ireland and I figure I'd clarify a few things just so you can accurately assess the costs here.

Going private for maternity will still cost you about 5k out of pocket even after insurance for the price level most people pay (€1-2000) but there are higher end plans with most insurers that will cover a significant portion of it. Usually plans over €4000.

Most insurance does not cover prescription medication or if it does, very little. The public Drugs Payment Scheme currently leaves a mac shortfall of €124 a month, so that's €1488 a year out of pocket if you're on the more expensive stuff like I am.

Health insurance does not cover dental. That's a separate insurance, though not as expensive. Add about €300 and expect shortfalls in some areas. Orthodontics only covered for kids as an example.

Health insurance. Great news is you pay based on cover only. Price is not impacted by conditions. New to insurance means 5 year wait for pre existing cover outside of public, but once you're past 5 years it's in your insurance. If you want a good all around insurance with no hospital excesses it will run close to €1700 a year. Closer to €1300 with a €100 excess per admission, €1900 or more if you want hip replacement cover.

Top end starts about €4600, some insurers go even higher but I don't see the point in all honesty. If you want access to non directory hospitals it can be handy but all insurers have close to full coverage of all major clinics in their directory so out of network rarely happens except on cheaper plans.

A cautious average person up to the age of about 55 might look something like this:

€1700 + €300 dental + €1488 medications + €1000 off plan costs high averaged over several years (pre & post natal, consult shortfalls, GP shortfalls, etc).

 I know redditors will regularly attribute behavior that only someone that is severely mentally challenged would exhibit to literally everyone they don't like (😭 Lmao you guys really think Putin is shelling his own power plant repeatedly and does false flags over and over to convince westerners that have never tried to understand a single word he has said. He fucks himself over regularly and never learns cause LOL Putin DUMB, amirite? Def not that you will beleive the most absurd propoganda without a second thought, cause only Russia does propaganda!) But you really think Musk went out of his way and explicitly demanded the engineers remove the ukraine from that list? Ha, Lol, Lmao, Roflmao!

Why would he do that? Like can someone explain what they believe his thought process was when making this ""decision""? An answer that doesn't attribute behavior to Stupidity, insanity or evil? I can guarantee you musk isn't a Bumbling retard rubbing his hands together with an evil plot.

 I like what he's doing with twitter, but aside from that I don't have a strong opinion on the guy. Spare me the ""dick riding"" and ""boot licking"" comments for stating that you don't become the richest man on the entire earth with an IQ of 60 and psychosis. You don't become the richest human ever in existence by being a clinically insane idiot, no matter how much you ""exploit"" people.

The right at least understands why the left believes what they do, even if they disagree. The left has the emotional stability of a toddler so they seriously think the right bases all their beleifs on mental retardation, schizophrenic hallucinations and being a comic book villain 

Anyways, it's unlikely Musk made intentional orders for this, especially during a time of mass policy and employee transitions.i could be wrong. I just see no point.

He's funded the Ukraine for nearly a year, and he literally has never said anything pro Russian. Saying negotiating is a good idea doesn't mean he is on ""Putin's payroll."" Ukies are dying every day for no reason. Nobody who lives outside the Donbass will be affected by Donbass not being part of the Ukraine.

Putin said NATO attempting to come that close to Russia (and a genocide of Russian speakers in Donbass) was a red flag. He's said it for 20yrs, and the Ukraine was openly talking about joining. They went so far as to request nuclear weapons to put on their border facing Russia. Honestly that sounds perfectly justified to me, but it's still valid if the reader disagrees. What you can't do there, is say they did it for. No reason whatsoever (aside from being an evil retarded Lunatic)

lwt3xb,"Absolutely incorrect. Coyots (long ""o"" - border pronunciation) are lazy, opportunistic, cautious, and sly as hell. If the food's alive, it takes work 'cause must kill first to eat. Dead's better. Just there, chow down. 

Growing up cattle ranching in the CO high country, I had a fair amount of experience with both coyote and mountain lion. At the time the State offered a bounty $10 per coyote tail and up to $300 for a female mountain lion. This was mid '50s into '60s. That was serious money, and we'd take a shot at most any coyote we sighted. Cougars required dogs to hunt, were dangerous, and impossible to track by eye. Once in a while people would get together to try a dog hunt. Was a lot of work.

Reason for all this. Supposedly they both ate livestock - though more sheep than cow. Time passed. Wildlife biologists decided to actually study things we mere peasants were interested in. Extensive work (all over N. America in fact) demonstrated that coyotes simply don't attack cattle - too damn much work - and virtually never went after calves. Again, momma was an issue. Sheep - dumber than cows but way smarter than turkeys - were slightly more likely to be attacked particularly lambs. (As for cougars, they are deer killing machines. Something like 90% of their diet is venison.)

Nearly every claimed coyote attack on livestock turned out to be a pack getting in early at the carrion, *i.e.,* getting to the dead calf first. There was a rare attack on lambs but again it was overwhelming that the 'yote was observed eating a dead one thus people blamed it on them.

I now live at an ""oasis"" that is home to 3 different coyote packs. Yes, stand on my front porch at the right time of year/night and you can hear all three of them from different parts of the valley. Does anyone worry about them? Only stupid people who don't put a lid on their garbage. (Javelinas are far worse at this.) 

Actually coyotes are a ""very good thing™. Why? They do a great job of cleaning up carrion and, perhaps more important, they chow down on rats, mice, and rodents of all kinds. In case you are unaware of human/rat symbiosis, if there are people, there are rats. The only good rat/mouse is a dead one. And no, they'll never be endangered.

Coyotes are smart, canny, wily, and sneaky as hell. I enjoy harassing them when possible. Also, I've been within touching distance of more than one - even in the middle of a small pack. They want nothing to do with humans (other than of course eat our leftover shite.) I've never heard of a properly documented coyote attack on a human. I suppose it's possible if you somehow get into a bitch's den with pups or something. And yes, I guess there humanoids that dumb. (They will eat the occasional dog/cat but only if it's real easy to get.)

And of course, low birth rates mean a younger generation does not so much exist to pay into the same pension your parents benefited from so millennials and younger are fucked once again.

It had to do with very little time to get ready before she had to go to work or something.). One morning it broke open in my backpack and basically everything was soaked in milk and Grape Nuts. It smelled disgusting. 

My teacher sent me to the custodians office where he helped me pick through and wash/dry off what I could, actually went out to some magic closet and got me a replacement textbook and then sat with me while we laundered my backpack and I copied my homework over to clean pages. No one in my class ever knew and I didn't have to get made fun of or earn some silly nickname like grape-nut-girl. (Trust me, there were plenty others instead.)

Not at all as easy as it sounds and definitely very valuable skills. 

I deliver mail as a side iob right now and although the job itself isn't that complicated, I was surprised how often I am used as a living GPS. I generally don't mind as people are usually kind and polite, but twice someone has actually gotten angry at me for not knowing how to get to a certain place as if I was supposed to know every street in my town. One even called out and said a proper mail deliverer would know 😅 I'm not sure what I said back to him, but I was honestly wondering why these people can't just use a GPS themselves or check their routes before they leave... Like it's suddenly my job to point people to their destination because I happen to deliver mail in that area. I felt like he treated me like a robot rather than a human.

k1l9mb,"I think the key word there is fresh pee, though you’re right

And I won’t disagree, if you have a fresh pee puddle from your own animal, using bleach is not an issue. Its more so the over use of bleach by the average person thats a problem

There’s many people that treat it like the miracle end-all of cleaning chemicals and use it for everything, when in reality it is very very rarely a necessity. And cleaning public spaces with bleach if you are not the care taker is never a good idea

I watched enough coworkers poorly do their job, and had a client gone in soon after and added their own chemicals it would’ve been a problem.
Even had a client absolutely insist we clean her entire bathroom with straight bleach. She was elderly and insisted her way was “the way”, and the client is always right 🙄 
had too many coworkers use our chemicals anyways and leave that job site whenever we got called to do it feeling pretty bad when they’d inevitably not listen to the cranky old woman who insisted everything had to be cleaned with bleach in her carpeted bathroom

Yes it disinfects but there’s a way to use it to do that properly

I wish everyone would read labels, do their research. But getting in to semantics of when or when not to use bleach of all things is dangerous. (Didn’t the president make a joke about drinking it?). It’s rarely the chemical for the job

Not to attack you or anything, I get defensive about this subject only because I’ve known enough people get very sick from misuse of bleach and other chemicals that are usually “safe” on their own",2020-11-30 16:33:06

Stop supporting this man. We have ditched many social media companies for better social media and technology.  We can do it again 💪

Here in the US you have to have amazing grades and apply to get into a good university. But in China they have to get good grades and apply for junior high, high school, and university. They have to be accepted into each school and it's intense. So that means a ton of school and tutors.

Edit: Ah! This blew up! I wish I could reply to all of your questions but there are so many now! I will say that many of the parents are wonderful and try to give their kids free time. But they also have to think of their kid's future and this is the only way to get into university. During their free time most love to read. Harry Potter is a HUGE favorite among the kids.

r4fp2s,"Health Care and College tuition. Two expenses that EVERY OTHER CIVILIZED NATION considers a basic right and investment into their country’s future. We Americans continue to allow Pharmaceutical Co, Insurance Co, and our employers to decide and control these benefits for our families. Our ability to procure health insurance should NOT be tied to our employers! The average American already pays more than these other countries we so shockingly react to when we hear they pay 30-50% taxes. Do the math. Your tax rate - 27-31% + we are paying for college and our healthcare premiums, copays, deductibles with after tax dollars. We are paying more! It should scare the shit out of people that your healthcare, tests, procedures, etc is not decided by your Dr. It is decided by your insurance co. I’m in the industry and I’m telling you, the wrong people have the power. Quick issue to ponder… that inhaler or CT scan or any other procedure the redditors here have mentioned…..not only does the cost vary extremely between US and other nations, it costs a different price depending on who’s paying here in our own system. Which type of insurance being used sets the prices. Health Insurance through your employer $250. Medicare price $40. VA benefits cost $80, Medicaid $60. Workers Comp $300. Private insurance $400. No insurance- whatever the fuck they say… it’s so ridiculous. I’m just making up these figures to make my point but I am not exaggerating the wide variance for the same damn thing. How can anyone look at this absurdity and justify it? What kind of sense does it make that the payor( the insurance co) gets to decide the price? But this is exactly how our system works. I don’t care which way you vote, which God you worship or whether or not you will wear a mask 🙄…. we ALL deserve the right to medical care and an education.
The politicians are the puppets for these companies and they just keep us, the people, all arguing over the same stupid shit, while we are fighting amongst ourselves, they have created this system where they control every side.",2021-11-29 07:28:48

h9lm7j,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2020-06-15 23:37:17

There was prayer and the pastor spoke at length about how the left is indoctrinating children. 🙄 One teacher bragged that since she was retiring she spent the whole year “teaching her babies about Jesus.” I have taught my son to be open minded and told him to not tell anyone that we are non believers so we are not singled out.

x6g2m4,"My fam is originally from NC, spent a few years living there, and this in no way surprises me, except that it was only 100 kids and not the whole damn school.
NC is ground zero for Dominionist domestic terrorists, and every one who has done an attack like McVey, Eric Rudolph the Atlanta Olympics Bomber, the guy who shot up a Sikh Temple, the folks responsible for murdering Dr. Tiller , all have roots to be traced to NC, it's an endless list of hard reichwing Christian Taliban MFs.

It's because they allow churches to get away with impunity and not be held accountable for their actions or their threats.
Remember, this is the state that has about a dozen preacher's calling for us LGBTQ to be put in concentration camps, or actively genocided along with feminists and anyone else not a straight, white, conservative Christian male , and is a hot bed of 1/6 terrorists hiding out, just like Rudolph and the rest.

NC has SO much potential, but unless they start taking a heavy constitutional hand to these religious zealots of Christian ISIS, this shit is only going to escalate.
FFS, this is a state that still actively tries to punish people for practicing witchcraft, aka freely practicing their own religion.

NC is also a hotbed of neo Nazis and Klansapiens, so while Charlotte may be ""Wall Street South"", most of the rest of the state is under domestic Terrorist control of the Christian Taliban, so tread wisely when visiting, and be prepared for hella fight against them if you move there.

The only way to halfway escape their claws, is living in Charlotte or Raleigh Durham, but even then, they slither their way into school boards, as teachers, cops, and anything else they can to gain power.
Fayetteville just needs to be yeeted into the sun, like Jacksonville, it's a military 💩 hole with absolutely no hope of ever escaping the nastiness that comes from being a military town.",2022-09-05 22:30:01

Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t work, but it certainly has a big effect if it’s on a stationary object."" TELL ME WHERE IN THERE HE SAYS DRINKING BLEACH OR STARING AT THE SUN IS THE CURE.

Getting to my point - the day I mentally quit the job was when during a micromanaging session, he asked me into his office. Show me that thing you did. 
 
I gesture to his screen, “Sure boss. Log into the secondary domain controller, and pull up the Active Directory whatsit (haven’t worked in windows admin in YEARS now). Then click on the whatever it was thing.” 

He sits there, has an Elon like pause, scoots his chair back, gets up, motions to it and says “why don’t you drive”.

Stopped giving a shit then and there and just collected a paycheck til I quit a few years later.

k6i58i,"Bro that's a freedom of the press ranking not free speech and the distinction between those is big. One thing here is that press is protected and heavily outside of defamatory stories. This is something that is consistently tested throughout the whole history of our country and it doesn't buckle even with Trump as president despite his massive attempts to thwart them. Woodrow Wilson passed sedition laws during World War 1,  which later were considered unconstitutional in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969). Now such law would ever be able to be passed again, this shows just how strong the first amendment is. 

Nearly ever other country on that list is fugazi, everytime these countries go to war or have dissention in their country they enact sedition laws. Just the other day France barred people from filming police officers. This is laughable to Americans and frankly I love Europeans and Canadians acting like their freedom of speech even glosses near ours.  It happens time and time again in Europe.

NOW GRANTED America is not perfect and I don't think they lead in every catagory, but acting like freedom of speech isn't our Michael Jordan then that's just laughable and a hilariously biased viewing. Our supreme court takes it very serious since they consider it a right at birth and often don't limit it outside of extremes such as CP.

A note on the shoe thing.. there is a side door attached to the kitchen literally right at the bottom of the stairs. But... Those damn shoes are on the opposite side of the house. 11:00am central standard time... My wife (amazing wife) cleaning so hard core she doesn't even notice me standing behind her to take this pic... Music cranked all the way. Now's the chance.. will he see the opportunity??

I'm afraid this thread isn't going to live up to the hype. You know, like a Ben Affleck Miramax movie 🤷🏻‍♂️ I'm waiting just like the rest of you

OMG OMG OHHHH MY GAWDDDDDDD. SHE CAME DOWN TO USE THE BATHROOM! IT'S ONE OF HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS! See... Mom might believe it's just a friendly sleepover, she was lucky enough to sleep through the fuck fest above our heads at 4am. I don't even know if the wife saw her come downstairs to use the bathroom. She's said nothing and it's not like I can ask... Yet




-------------------------------------------


Omg this kid!! NONCHALANT AF he casually strolls downstairs... AND grabbed those shoes and went back upstairs. Side eyeing me the whole way past. I shot him a little wink 😉. They gonna hit that side door. bet. Well that's a wrap folks! Mama just went to the bedroom to lay down and read for a bit. He's got a good 2-3 hour window... Looks like young love finds a way, for now! 💏

-------------------------------------------


And closure... Sure enough, hit the side door and they gone. I don't know about you but need a drink after that suspense. Thanks for following along! That was amazing. So this is where everyone else drops their SoundCloud or GoFundMe links but I don't have either of those so fuck it, let's try this... Drop YOUR links in reply to this update.

wbvtl6,"I used to think this was my tinfoil hat moment but I really don’t think it is anymore. 

Y’all this is intentional. The key to increased staffing isn’t lowering credentials, it’s improving teaching working conditions (psst that’s students’ learning conditions too) which includes raising pay. But why would the powers that be give schools more funding when there’s an opportunity to make bank in private ed? Charter schools receive public ed funding and resources, draining an already rapidly dissolving workforce. 

If you decrease the quality of your staff, you decrease the quality of learning. Scores drop, which means state and federal funding drops. A decrease in funding means cutting staff, admin selecting cheaper and less quality funding, and less investment in professional development, among other issues. The building will fall apart (if they haven’t already) and then ultimately, affluent and folks with solid financials will leave the district. Student population will drop and guess what? There’s literally a price tag attached to every learner in the classroom. Fewer students = smaller budget and less funding at the state level. Quality of the school district continues to drop and the families who can’t leave suffer. Their learners will receive a less quality education from less qualified staff. Students with disabilities, advanced learners, struggling readers, and English language learners will see their services not get met (again, if that isn’t happening already). 

But private schools? Charter? That’s where the moneys at. You don’t have to require licensure or even an education background, which means you don’t have to pay your staff as much as a certified teacher in a public setting. Private schools don’t have to honor IEPs or follow the IDEA act. They don’t need to pay for specialized teachers or student support, which cuts their overhead. They don’t have to follow evidence based practices, teach evolution or history, which means they don’t have to keep up on curriculum (whole word reading anyone?). Private schools don’t have to feed their students or provide resources to struggling families. Granted, I have taught in many private or charter schools. Just because a private or charger school does any of these things doesn’t mean they have to. 

✨ capitalism ✨

Edit: Also, typically when these articles say someone can go into the classroom without teacher licensure, it means they haven’t completed the necessary credentials. Emergency or temporary licensure comes with the requirements of completing X program with Y credits and so on. So while the teacher isn’t credentials, they’re not credentials yet. 

It’s how I got my elementary teaching license. I had a MA just not teaching credentials. I taught while attending classes at the same time and completed my license requirements in 13 months. Every semester I had to provide proof I was earning my required 6 credits in my licensure program. And I went into more debt and a private institution made 15K off me.",2022-07-30 16:04:22

124l6oa,"**Gods.** Women get to *<checks notes>* **give birth to their husband's kids for all eternity,** without any breaks because they are *<checks notes>* **constantly pregnant.** 🤔

""Their"" is definitely in the plural sense there. Polygamy may currently not be a Mormon thing on Earth, but in Mormon heaven polygamy is the norm, with every God-man having multiple living female baby machines available for his use.

Also the married women reside on their husband's planet, they don't get their own planet. 

 Technically Goddesses, but they don't get anything nice for being Goddesses, so it's an empty title instead of a promotion, a paper certificate instead of a raise.

Unmarried men get to get married to women in the afterlife and get their own planet. No male incels in Mormon heaven.

Unmarried women get basically nothing. They have to serve on man planets. If they're lucky, and agree to it, they will be married to an existing married man and begin being pregnant for all eternity while being in childbirth for all eternity. The implicit idea is that ***women will prefer an eternity of being pregnant and being in childbirth simultaneously***, to serving men on their planets. 🤷🤦",2023-03-28 16:15:28

- staples and any other print shop you can try to name was also closed. 

- I couldn't print at work either because, surprise, closed

The signature is on 'page 2', if there were such a thing.  But there isn't.  So I end up having to buy a printer right then.  Good thing that coupon that printed after my 'page 1' debacle DIDN'T apply to printers or ink. ☹️.

Lawyers don't even pay that much I believe and if they do...they make a lot more money than cops and can recoup that loss.

Public institutions do this thing where if your over a certain age (60? I think) you can go to college for free and basically audit the class. Literally every old person in my undergrad university that did this save for like 1 person was an old white dude that would ramble for 10 mins straight and completely take over the class. Would NEVER contribute to discussions and would literally talk over the professor about bullshit that they thought was more important or more educational. 

GOD FORBID that the person also experienced something relevant to the topic though. One old dude was retired military who was stationed in Japan for two years and married a Japanese woman. Literally EVERY DAYFOR A WHOLE SEMESTER (18weeks/2 meetings a week) he would literally cut off the professor and tell the professor that they were wrong about Japanese history. Difference was my professor had multiple degrees in Theology and Asian Studies vs this dude who lived in Japan for two years. Apparently living in Japan and biking to Mount ~~Kilimanjaro~~ Fuji twice makes you an expert on Premodern Japan instead of taking 12+ years of classes dedicated to Asian studies and working for translations and museum directors in Japan 🙄 

The dude never took hints to stop talking and would interject during people’s presentations and delay class solely to talk. The professor talked to him multiple times to move on and let us get back to the class work and the dude would straight up ignore the professor bc the “I’m older = I don’t have to listen to you” mentality.

3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.

4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.

5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.

Fixing it to the ground. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍As any Christian knows, the adoption or practice of paganism is completely unacceptable in the eyes of Christ.

Elon specifically and publicly asked the guy what the problem was BEFORE essentially declaring that his devs were useless.

Eric very calmly and professionally replied  to his question, explaining that technical debt is the issue, because getting the boss’s shiny new features has historically trumped doing things properly and, well … this is the price that the product pays (I’m a lead dev, so v. relatable, ugh!) 

Elon then fucking ignores his answer and slags them off to Twitter! 

Also, Elon should have asked  Eric this on their internal slack channels, not on Twitter! If Elon publicly asked him, Eric has licence to give a candid , public response. Elon literally invited him to do so!

While Elon has done some douchey things, the far left are vilifying and amplifying any little thing he does now and it’s rather cruel.

However he will not subvert our democracy and wipe his ass with the Constitution like your boy Trump. So I trust we will be fine.

My dad's 401k was almost decimated in 2008, but hey, at least these financial institution were forced to take money and paid it back, lost quite a bit again, then lobbied successfully against the rules imposed to keep that from happening... Again.

Financial responsibility for the poor, but not the banks. 👍

A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, ... cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**

twyd6u,My husband came from a home where he never showed emotions and when he was with me it was the first time he really was able to feel and express them. Your life will be bigger and fuller if you feel freer within it—don’t let your wife’s toxic masculinity keep you from being your whole self! The complaining part might be coming from somewhere else or from the way you are expressing your emotions—take some queues from how she expresses emotions and see if you can begin by matching her method. It will be in a format that is easier for her to understand. If you have kids you should definitely learn to experience your emotions so they can also have fuller and happier lives too 💗,2022-04-05 19:29:09

I feel you on that being expensive AS FUCK. Also I had to pay cause I had issues .. I am
More scared of exams than I am
Of ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD when I haven’t done them in a while. I slightly desensitize over time but usually tests are not close enough together for that to really pan out for me as a treatment. Phobia is best treated by desensitization. It’s highly effective for that mental health issue. But it’s hard to expose yourself to that outside of actual exams. You know it’s not real. So I wouldn’t lose it if I did practice tests ....


Basically I had EXAM PHOBIA . It was legit. Don’t even ask. Actually if you wanna ask, I wrote it out because I feel like people don’t understand how you can physically make yourself have an iq of under 60 when it’s usually about 130 due to a bit of terror and panic to the extent that it seems like the world might disintegrate in an instant 

Basically this happened to me one year, it was 2nd year and I BALLSED UP first year. I switched majors into something I actually liked by y2. Y1 was fuckery and deciding what to do and drinking cause I was 16 and raised in a strict house yo, so I never got to fuck up and NOW WAS THE TIME. So ya, since I decided I wanted to go 2 an MA PSYCH post BSC. I had to ACE 

The last 3 years to get my gpa to honours. One test done wrong would kill my dreams cause I ALREADY used all my fuck ups in year one. So I was STRESSED. Also i worked out two hours a day, did full time school, worked part time, and drank like a hellion on weekends. I was also a little anorexic, and a lot stupid i was only 17. I didn’t have like, maturity. And sanity. I was still figuring out coping mechanisms that needed fixin from a terrible school experience prior to that, and parents who didn’t know the first thing about mental health. 

I pressured myself into like, feeling like I was walking into the cave of a hungry bear. That’s how I felt for the days leading up to a test. I’d procrastinate because I was frozen in fear and I’d push it away, then I’d study like a wild maniac. I studied long and good when I knew I was at the minimum time I could achieve an A left before the test.

I honestly would have rather gone and fought a large predator, that’s what my body felt like when I went to tests. And as psych students know, shorter breaths, high heart rate and dry mouth.... what happens in fight flight freeze? YOUR BLOOD FLOWS AWAY FROM
YOUR BRAIN INTO YOUR MUSCLES. You’re prepared to BOOK IT OUTTA THERE. you are NOT ready to sleep the night before. 

So you go In absolutely *mangled* on coffee, because *you got no Sleep* and no doc will give someone my age a benzo to sleep before the test.  

Sometimes I would forget everything. Mostly I’d just panic, which means memories aren’t readily accessible for tests. It came from a highly unfair exam written by a TA. It was like fill in the blank and short answer and some other types of questions but based on 1000s of pgs of reading on neurobiology. They tested on footnotes. Things they didn’t even bring up once in class. 

Knowledge of major themes or a solid working knowledge of the brain *didn’t help a girl*. God forbid one UNDERSTAND THE MATERIAL. 

I studied for a week and I got 50%. The average was 30%. There were only 25 questions and 17 of those were fill in the blank (FITB). No word banks or hints. Straight neuroscience and rote memory from Shit they didn’t emphasize nor even speak of in class

AFTER THE TEST. Found out most people did ok on the FITB they decided to ONLY bell curve the half Of the test that I DID WELL IN. 

Most did well on the first part FITB and not the second (working knowledge of lecture topics, like say, the role of BDNF in plasticity... or whatever). 

Basically everyone did good on FITB. I however, did terrible on the first PAGE and better on the second. They gave an extra 20 percent to people on the half EVERYONE EXCEPT ME did poorly on. 

Bc I already did well on that bellcurved section (that showed working knowledge of the brain and ability to apply hypotheticals) I DIDNT GET A SINGLE
EXTRA PERCENT

WHAT PROF BELLCURVES A TEST AND ONLY
DOES ONE PAGE AND FUCK ANYONE WHO DID GOOD ON THAT PAGE? Fuck anyone who actually understood the lecture material!! Fuck anyone who did TWENTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE WITHOUT THE CURVE (me). I got %50. Avg was 30%.


So, I did poorly in fill in the blank based on fuckin footnotes. It showed zero but rote memory of things they didn’t go over in class. So ya, because I already got good grades on that section I DID NOT RECEIVE A SINGLE EXTRA PERCENT toward my final mark

EVERYONE ELSE GOT LIKE 20% minimum extra. Max 25%. Therefore now the average was 50-55%

If the whole test had been bellcurved I woulda got 70-75%. 

But no. Prof douche only bellcurved one page of two pages on the test. He bellcurved the short answers; I got perfect on that half. I flunked the FITB part. 

BUT.... because “MOST people only had a problem with the short answer questions so I’ll change things super super UNEQUALLY”. ILL ONLY GIVE THE PEOPLE AN EXTRA (up to) 20% on the SHORT ANSWERS. Fuck you if you failed the other part basically. 

It’s like the prof was at home thinking ....*””Even if you achieved a significantly higher overall mark, I’m gonna make it super unfair - I’m gonna make it so that everyone who barely studied got 20 extra percent and that the people who studied hard got zero extra””*

My work was in the *shitter* cause of the bell curve applied to *everyone BUT me.*

Don’t ask me how I managed to do well on the part everyone else sucked at, and vice versa. 


I Have *ZERO CLUE - trust and believe*

My mark stayed at 50, meanwhile their 30 percents magically became 50s. 

I should have gotten a 70 percent overall. 

If it was fair. And I was so young I didn’t know that I shoulda advocated for myself. I was bloody 17. I was bullied most of my life. I didn’t know the meaning of self advocating. So I DIDNT SELF ADVOCATE- I swallowed that shit

If the damn prof had TAKEN THE TIME TO WRITE THE TEST HIMSELF IT ALL WIULDA NEVER HAPPENED

HE CONCEDED THIS HIMSELF. he was like ye my
TA took shit for part one (that we DIDNT BELLCURVE) that we never covered 

I can just imagine him being like Sorrrryyy 😣 that Lazy fuck! You kno he done wrong when a prof admits it. Profs are egotistical af. 

Also how can u have a test worth 50% of your final grade with only 20-something questions, half of which you admit you never covered and were included in the fill in the blank section. In fucking neurobiology, that shit isn’t exactly light reading. Honestly ONE OF THOSE NEURO CLASSES was like doing 2-3 English or history or politics classes, it was THAT much more work. And it was elective to take it for me; I coulda done lazier social psychs but I CHOSE to have a much deeper understanding of neurobio so I could mesh it with the basic social psych stuff and personal experience, and abnormal psych, and be a WAY BETTER THERAPIST. sheesh 🙄 

I was bullied and quiet, depressed and sometimes anxious. I pressured myself to extreme and I was evil in my self criticisms- no one could hurt me more than me. 

That’s why I was in psychology to begin with, with a healthy side of neuro- I needed to know wtf was wrong with me. Later, I could use it to help others!

Sorry this was long but I get upset just thinking about it I can’t ducking help it ... 

I would advocate for myself these days tho, so there’s that",2021-03-01 23:52:41

I don't know about all the other languages but here we have a different suffix (-ard) between every 6 zeros step so we don't have to say a thousand million for example.

White people would pay either the ""police"" or the Klan

Asians would seek protection from the Yakuza or Triads as appropriate.

Etc etc

You would no longer have a country, just a tribal landscape where communities band together for mutual protection and development.

I can just see people saying ""yeah, but we would get all the military"" - but in a no tax system, there would be no military and those military personnel currently serving would most likely return to their cultural roots taking hardware with them. How much of the military would your ethnic group end up with?

This is 💯 insane just like the premise it's based on, but no one seems to actually think it through.

I'm new to the system, it didn't really stick during school and I'm trying to understand it now. Looking at the election results map, it looks as though the majority of the country is red. The senate results are 46/48 and the House 184/207. The Democrats lost 8 seats.

uz1uz5,"GUN RESPONSIBILITY LEADS TO GUN SAFETY  
A Common-Sense Approach to Second Amendment Issues.  ©  
With the increasing massacres, gun-related deaths, and heartbreaking reports of children with guns, (up to 8 child incidents per day in the US), almost everyone can agree there are too many guns in our society. The death toll is rising along with the number of guns. Mindful of the Las Vegas Massacre in which almost 1,200 rounds were fired, mostly into the crowd, by a single shooter in a very few minutes, it’s time to fully grasp that guns are primarily designed to kill or maim people and animals. Since their basic nature is lethal, society is fully justified in requiring firearm protections to ensure public safety.   
There is no need or justification to repeal the 2nd Amendment enshrined in our Constitution, it was put there to safeguard freedoms… and freedom’s obligations. The way to address 2nd Amendment issues is to legislate responsible, well-regulated gun ownership as the 2nd Amendment clearly states.   
1.	  Responsibility of Gun Ownership  
As a deadly weapon, every gun must have an owner who is legally responsible for it.  
An unregistered gun is a threat to civilized society because no one is legally responsible. Guns are dangerous. If no one is willing to accept the responsibility for a gun, it should be destroyed.   
  
2.	 Licensing, Registration, and Background Checks  
Every gun and its owner must be Licensed and Registered and all gun owners must pass a Background Check.  
This is how society can identify and regulate who is responsible for a gun. Society mandates the same three basic requirements for motor vehicles, despite their primary purpose being simply transportation.   
  
3.	Insure All Firearms  
If you drive a car, you are expected to have liability insurance. It is your responsibility.  
Like driving, gun responsibility requires gun owners’ insurance so that victims or anyone else involved can be suitably compensated. Society must not bear the predictable costs when individuals claim gun ownership rights without accepting gun ownership responsibilities.   
Who currently pays to clean up a murder, suicide, or mass shooting? Incredibly, these costs are paid by taxpayers and victims.  
  
4.	The gun owner is liable for their gun   
No matter what happens with a gun, if the registered owner fails to secure it, the owner is both responsible and liable.  
Guns don’t kill people, they are just efficient tools. People kill people. Guns cannot be held liable, therefore ‘accidents’ cannot be blamed on guns as they often are now. Gun responsibility requires guns to be kept securely, so they can’t fall into the wrong hands.    
As a deadly weapon, guns cannot be ‘accidentally’ pointed at anyone. If anyone is wounded or killed by a gun being cleaned, handled, or dropped, the gun owner is responsible and liable.     
Killing unnecessarily is horrible. The shooting of a child, or by a child, is the worst crime imaginable and must be treated as such. If a child has access to a gun, the gun owner is liable for what happens next. If a child or anyone else is ‘accidentally’ killed or wounded, the gun owner must, at a minimum, be charged with some degree of Murder. If a child has access to a gun, the crime is recognized by law as depraved indifference to the consequences of not securing the gun, and the gun owner is charged accordingly. Any of the above crimes cannot legally be the fault of a child or a gun. Accidental discharge cannot be considered a defense.  
  
  
  
5.	Do Not Threaten Your Neighbor With a Firearm      
Civilian concealed carry is sometimes necessary for self-defense, but a concealed gun does not imply a threat to anyone unless openly displayed.   
Public, civilian open-carry (in a non-hunting or target practice setting) is an implicit threat to your neighbor, a bully’s intimidation tactic. Open-carry put in basic terms demands (from another point of view); ‘Do not mess with me, I have granted myself Police powers. I am fully prepared to shoot you at any time, and for any reason, I think applies.’ Proponents may call it self-defense, or exercising their rights, but from another point of view, it is an assumed claim to possibly be your Judge, Jury, and Executioner.  
Openly carried firearms have no place at Government Offices, public establishments, or at protests on our streets where they increase tensions, constitute an extra-judicial mob, invite law-enforcement reprisals, and intensify police militarization.   
  
6.	  Live by the Gun, Possibly Die by the Gun  
Stand your ground laws are a legal path to anarchy, because, from either end of the gun, you can legally be the next victim.   
‘Stand Your Ground’ laws say you only have to feel threatened to defend yourself, anywhere, at any time. Since it is often problematic to tell a good guy with a gun from a bad guy with a gun, anyone has the right under these laws, to feel threatened by civilian, open-carry. As a result, the threatened have the legal right to defend themselves. Like the Wild West, the problem turns into who shot first and why? The logic of these laws is indefensible.  
  
7.	Rapid-Firing, Multi-cartridge Weapons Are Weapons of Mass Destruction    
As a practical definition, any weapon that can kill many people quickly and easily (or silently) is a Weapon of Mass Destruction.   
Do the dead know any difference between a Bomb, a Chemical Weapon, or a Rapid-Fire, Multi-Cartridge Firearm? There is no responsible justification for civilians to own these weapons unless killing all your neighbors is considered self-defense. These are Weapons of War and Terrorism and otherwise have no practical use to society. We spend huge sums worldwide on our military to protect us from these weapons… just not on our streets.   
Our Police, First Responders, and the Military are skilled public servants and deserve our support. Their lives are on the front line in the course of their duties. We should not ask them to face weapons of mass destruction, on duty or off. If you think clearly about it, no one on the streets of America, should. Own them legally or not, keep them responsibly, don’t parade them in the streets, unless you are prepared to surrender them.  
  
8.	Militias Are Only Legal When Called Forth  
Although militias are mentioned in the Second Amendment, It is settled law that they can legally exist only if, and when, called forth by a Governor or President. Militias are private armies and require responsible control. Unlike an Army with transparent command and control structures with civilian oversight, a militia is an armed mob, a form of terrorist cell, responsible only to themselves, and potentially hazardous to everyone else. A peaceful society cannot tolerate guerilla forces in their midst, and certainly not armed, private militaries parading in our streets or practicing for the overthrow of our government.      
  
Finally, let’s take a moment to send our thoughts and prayers for our brave American children who give up their lives to protect our current, almost entirely unregulated, 2nd Amendment right to bear arms.",2022-05-27 22:24:11
uz1uz5,"We literally have no need whatsoever for those guns. I like shooting as a sport, I never get to do it, but I do think it's a good sport. But... Why the hell do we need semi-automatics/assault rifles, any of that?? Their is no sport that requires them, they have no use in hunting, they are only good for killing people. No other reason.

Besides, lots of guns are banned. Sawed off shotguns?? Either Illegal or . Highly regulated. No one is complaining about that. Why? Because no one needs them.

Introduced in 1989, the FICO® Score changed the lending landscape for good. In the days before credit scoring, people were often denied credit because there was no unbiased structure for evaluating them objectively. The system was not fair, fact-based or consistent.

zur4qy,"Same. I think a lot of these so-called ""Christians"" have simply warped their perception of the bible to fit their current political views. Like, to them, I'm sure they consider all migrants to be ""evil sinners"", while they're the ""righteous"" that are defending their ""sacred land"", or whatever insane BS they believe in.

It's funny, too, because so many of them always love bringing up ""Jesus"", especially in relation to Christmas, and yet, if they actually knew anything about stories of Jesus from the bible, the character was much more of a ""liberal"" than a ""conservative"", and if that person existed today, the right would regard him as a ""far left woke extremist lib"".

I've had random internet people on social media argue against me on that, too, and it's like, how exactly do you read the stories of Jesus and come to the conclusion that he would have been a conservative nationalistic bigot? Hell, I'm pretty sure the story of his death was that he was crucified because leaders were threatened by his teachings, presumably for being overly progressive. I would love for any of them to show me passages in the bible in which Jesus would condone bigotry towards immigrants, people of different races, ethnicities, sexuality, gender identity, etc., or any of the extreme nationalistic views that modern Christians have, and yet, all I ever get is ""lol Nope, Jesus wasn't a woke lib(slur) snowflake like you"". 🙄🤷‍♂️

But again, it's like the right has just totally warped the bible and their religious beliefs to fit their current political ideologies. They're not even real Christians, at this point; they've simply selectively cherry picked pieces of the bible that fit their beliefs, and they've filled in the gaps with ""anyone that's not a straight, cis-gendered, American-born, God-fearing, Republican Christian is a bad, evil person that is trying to destroy our country!"".",2022-12-25 10:34:25

Outside of the outrageous fees many of them are just over bearing and invasive. 

I remember one night myself and a buddy rented an Airbnb and the buddy had his cousin and his wife swing by to see him while we were in town.

The owner sees it on the ring doorbell and immediately calls me about no additional guests and tried to charge me extra. 

It’s not like they were staying the night and it was around dinner time when they came over.

I will specify I am bringing a pet to filter search results, click into a listing, and description says “no dogs allowed” but the host clearly checked “dogs allowed.” If you do bring a dog, $25-50 extra per night. I booked one place that advertised a private yard for the dog - the hidden fun was that the other SIX units got to share this “private” yard with their dogs! And the owner fought me on the cancellation with full refund. $200-300 cleaning fees, state tax on hotels, sales tax. And then they have ridiculous requests - start the laundry and dishwasher so their paid housekeepers don’t have to, take out your own trash- what is the $200-300 for? I’ve had housekeeping before and $200 would get you a few hours of time. I’ve stayed in one that would charge if you didn’t wash AND put up your own kitchen items - hear me out on this, it is disgusting to think the cleanliness of the kitchen items is left to prior occupants, so now I would need to clean them before and after use.

I didn’t look into the dimensions of the room before booking, but it was akin to a prison cell and I could feel the claustrophobia closing in on me the moment I entered.

They had taken the photos from weird angles that made it seem like a ‘normal’ room.
The bed was the cherry on the top- it was three mattresses stacked on the top of each other. It wasn’t even tied together, so the mattresses kept on shifting when I slept. 
Also, no headboard 😐If I wanted to sit, my sole choice was the tiny couch which I’m guessing was previously owned by their 5 year old.

I just needed a place to crash for the night, so I shut off the light and slept in. 
I could have gotten a room at a good hotel for lesser price, without having to clean the room before leaving.

The owner had the audacity to ask for a review after I left. I mean, shouldn’t you just be thankful that I’m not leaving a review to warn people not to stay in this mini-dungeon? 

Airbnbs have lost their charm. Crazy expensive, absurd rules, and you have to spend the last couple of hours literally doing chores for the owner.
You don’t go to a restaurant to eat the meal and then get hauled into the kitchen to wash the dishes and mop the floor, right?

The PUA benefit was really keeping me pretty even with my normal income, but then it went away, and I took out and EIDL which I will have to pay back, and now I’m getting state unemployment, but not really because the little bit of business I am still able to do has me right at the amount to exceed income and not get it. I am approved for 235$ a week in unemployment, if I make anywhere near that I get nothing. I was making anywhere from 800$-1000 a week before the pandemic.

Cool, there's 700 billion dollars for a public bailout. Well, actually only 500 billion, because 200 billion of the military budget is payroll and benefits. Unless, you know, you want to make an additional 3+ million other people homeless, jobless, and without health care.

500Billion ÷ 230million US adults= $2175 per person.

So people might make rent for another 2 to 3 months, and the US is without a functional military. China decides to flex nuts on other parts of Southeast Asia, there's nobody there to stop them. Russian might decide to take some of the land back of the former USSR, and the US military bases in Europe are empty. South Korea doesn't have any help from the US, North Korea decides to try to invade SK.

When I (Scottish) was 8, Portugal knocked England out of the Euros. First thing I did was get my mum to take me to the sports shop to buy a Portugal top. They were sold out. Luckily an English man was just returning the one he'd bought his son. So we got it at a discount. It pissed my English mates off so much, I loved it. 

If I was a big Republican who hated the libtards, and was in the market for a new car. I could go get a big gas guzzling truck to drive around a city it's way too big for. Or I could buy a car off the guy I've just started fanboying over because the left hate him.

>The invincible ignorance fallacy[1] is a deductive fallacy of circularity where the person in question simply refuses to believe the argument, ignoring any evidence given.

**But some of the billionaire fan boys on the right are pathetic enough to do it for free as Republican culture warriors** ￣\＿(ツ)＿/￣

* Even though Elon Musk didn't actually invent or start Tesla and instead **[literally bought and sued for the ""retroactive co-founder"" title from Tesla's actual founders](https://www.quora.com/Did-Elon-Musk-found-Tesla-1)** and used his wealth that was supported by [his family's Apartheid South African jewel mining wealth](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-dad-tells-bi-about-the-familys-casual-attitude-to-wealth-2018-2) to invest in Tesla, he should be worshipped like Iron Man and we can live on artificial Mars instead of annoying natural Earth with our daddy Elon robot girlfriends!

* Even though Elon Musk falsely labelled a heroic diver a pedophile because daddy Elon didn't get the hero spotlight attention he wanted from media and fanboys, how dare you ""cancel"" him for lying about these things, abusing his corporation's workers, misinforming the public about important issues, or unethical corporate tactics! He smoked with Joe Rogan and hosted a YouTube meme video! It's not pandering when Elon Musk is Minecraft tweeting, but every human activity Democrats do is pandering! We need to protect billionaires!

* The not ventilators that Elon Musk kept PR tweeting about that didn't even show up to hospitals at least push air around in some way even though they're not ventilators! You can put your pitchforks down because of this pretend reality using my new definition of ventilators! Outrage culture libruls owned! #cancelculture

* when he said there would be zero coronavirus cases by April, he didn't say which April *taps head*

* But if I simp hard enough for daddy Elon, he's gonna build me a robot girlfriend on Mars

>I think that if having someone build them a robotic girlfriend on fucking Mars is the easiest way for these guys to get laid, they should probably spend less time worshipping billionaires on the internet and more time meeting real people.

The Churches:

Ephesus, The Loveless Church: The people in Ephesus were hard-working people who endured and hated evil. From the outside, they may have looked like they had it together but their hearts were wrong. The 2 greatest commandments are to love God and love people (Mark 12:30-31) and Ephesus was missing this single greatest component of all Christianity. Love.

Smyrna, The Persecuted Church: There was no rebuke for this persecuted church. Although they were continually under physical hardship, the people of Smyrna were promised that they would not be hurt by the second death. They were encouraged to stay faithful, even when facing physical death.

Pergamum, The Worldly Church: This church was the tolerant church. Although they refused to deny Christ, they allowed sin like idols, immorality, cults and heresies to remain among them.

Thyatira, The Wrong Doctrine Church: The church of Thyatira had love, faith and good works. They were even patient people who were eager to grow. Where they fell short was their doctrine, which was infiltrated by idolatry, sexual sin and pagan traditions.

Sardis, The Spiritually Dead Church: Almost all of the people in the church of Sardis had fallen asleep spiritually, except for a small remnant of believers. The Dead Church was encouraged to kindle and revive any small bit of faith they had left.

Philadelphia, The Spiritually Alive Church: Philadelphia did well. There was no rebuke for this church of faith. They kept the name of Jesus and never denied it. There is a promise in the kingdom of heaven for these Christians.

➡️ Laodicea, The Lukewarm Church: The church of Laodicea, unlike Philadelphia, only received rebuke. They were neither hot nor cold as we read in Revelation. Their reliance on riches and things of this world resulted in a lukewarm, halfway-in type of Christianity.",2021-02-28 00:16:48

From an outsiders perspective, your medical system is crazy. For me it's based on capitalism first, people's health second.. Which in my mind is criminal. Truly criminal. 

How insurance companies can argue with each other about how and where you are treated (is madness) and in many cases people die waiting in that process.

When my daughter cries I'm all ""Oh dear, oh darling"" I can't tell if that's generally because she has a good reason for crying (she does) or I'm biased too because she's a girl.

My son on the other hand... He is **very** 2 years old. He has a 30 min meltdown because he ate all the kiwi fruit and there isn't any more.  Later another 20 min meltdown because he's pooped and doesn't want to change his diaper. Evening another 20 min cry because I asked him ever so kindly to ""play gently"" with the toy he was slamming in the cupboard door.

I want to be all ""Oh dear, oh darling"" to my son too but Jesus fuck eventually you get sick of pointless crying... or is it just because he's a boy and I'm inherently biased. 🤷

FWIW I've never told him to stop crying for a gendered reason. More like ""You are sad the kiwi fruit is gone, aren't you? I like Kiwi fruit too, it's a shame that it's all gone. I don't think crying will make more magically appear though so let's stop.""",2022-05-17 02:09:28

He will defend the southern confederacy to all corners of the Earth. To his defense, he has read a LOT about it from the best resources you can gather. I haven't heard him say (a single time!) That slavery was wrong. He'll say things like 'not ALL southerners were abusive to their slaves' and while that could be true, the whole act of owning a person rubs me the wrong way. And this same quote is often said about women suppression; 'it was a different time period' yeah, it was a different time period, but honoring it as if it's Sunday worship is only encouraging it to come back. A lot (but not all) whites are quite comfortable with the topic because it doesn't subject them. These people aren't defending a time period.

The government can increase taxes (such as income tax and VAT) and cut spending. This improves the government's budget situation and helps to reduce demand in the economy. Both these policies reduce inflation by reducing the growth of aggregate demand.

qabd83,"I binge watched HIMYM for over a month or so and the ending killed the whole thing for me.  

From what I remember the first season was amazing, next couple seasons pretty great too. It started getting repetitive after that, and then they spent a whole freakin’ season on the wedding, and like two measly episodes on meeting the mother. Should have been the other way around, two episodes on the stupid wedding and at least half a season of getting to know the mother (like wtf really???).  The scenes with Ted and the mom getting to know each other were so freakin’ cute too I can’t even believe how it ended up being handled.
  
I made myself watch the last season or two even though is started feeling repetitive and the wedding episodes were dragged out. I kept going because I was very invested in seeing how Ted and the mom met. And then THAT ending happened and it felt like such a gut punch. Can’t even watch a rerun of it now, what a horrible ending! Guess I’m still salty lmao 😂",2021-10-18 05:09:15
qabd83,"I didn’t hate it nearly as much as other people, but the show definitely made a huge turn quality-wise after they caught up with the books.

I mean its not crazy to sit there and wonder why the world governments are so desperate for people to get a vaccine for 99% + surviveable virus mean while they kill more people by accident every year than than that of which die from the said virus. Here in canada 35000 deaths happen every year from medical errors meanwhile the virus has only killed 26 thousand people in almost 2 years. At some point you have to wonder why they werent so eager to cure cancer or ban automobiles that kill over 2 million people world wide every year. Its never been about saving lives its control. I still dont know anybody or know of anybody that passed away from it. I can count on my hand how many have died from cancer, suicide and overdose... but lets tuck that under the rug before everybody starts paying attention again wouldnt want to offend the lab rats. 🤣",2021-08-09 00:44:32

Words cannot describe how terrible the Nazi’s were. How they tried to destroy a people, push radical rhetoric, and destroy what we know as freedom. In many historical texts, a large portion of the nazi regime did not agree or want to carry out the atrocities their leadership wanted. Many went against orders, risking their own life and their family. Many didn’t. Many fought for their country and the men and women in their unit...because pride for your country meant something even if the ideology was cruel and ruthless. 

By no means am I justifying the behavior of the Nazis, but, many people were and are good people regardless of their leadership. Look at our own political problem. Your best friend might be a closet Trump supporter? 🤷🏻‍♂️.",2020-11-14 16:55:49

I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I think the minimum wage increase is going to have more negative impacts than we realize, but in theory it sounds so good. To me, the problem is not that wages are too low..... cost of goods are low in America, it’s rent thats too high and if we don’t cap rent before we enact a minimum wage increase I’m afraid rent will increase even more and it will be all for nothing 🤷‍♂️.

>That’s not how progressive tax rates work, and the fact that the rich pay a substantially larger percentage of taxes shows that. 

🤷‍♂️

I dont care that their real dollar contributions are higher because as a share of their revenues and incomes its far lower than my contributions, you just said the same thing twice, and now you've forced me to say the same thing again but in a different way.

I do not care that a rich person or business pays 10x or a 100x the total dollar amount that I pay, I care about what % that is of their income, and its far lower than what I pay..

Its fundamentally wrong that I pay 30% of my income and they effectively pay 3% or less of their income/revenues....idgaf what the true average % is, less than 30 is wrong",2021-07-11 11:57:09

So she ends up ordering a lot because I know she’ll want to eat with us, and after we discuss it she often just volunteers to order it because she’s more particular about her food choices than I am. 

And honestly if you are watching kids all day it’s enough to just watch the kids.  They’re exhausting.  They come right behind you and destroy everything right after you clean it up. Like you spend all day cleaning up after kids and the house is still a wreck when your partner gets home because kids are walking disasters. 

And then for being an oaf? It’s true. Men are idiots. Most men I know are idiots about most things pertaining to relationships, the running of a household, fashion, finances. I’m a fucking idiot.

As a well known impostor once said, CONSTANT VIGILANCE at all times, is necessary. now more than ever. If 14+ people can't be trusted to do the right thing, no idea how the hell yall elementary teachers can do it. Like - there was literally an article released today about kids and covid. apparently they spread it WAY more easily than adults if they catch it. They can't cut off recess because that'll make the kids go insane, but cutting off gym might work for at least a semester, though it is the curriculum.

But the government reports we've been getting here have totally idealistic expectations. one of our orders as kids and teachers are. ""Never ever use someone else's materials ever."" Kids will literally swipe pencils off desks as they walk by. Everything gets shared. probably saliva too.

Both my parents work in elementary schools. It's gonna be hell. They don't wanna catch a damn virus and neither do their kids. But chances are, they probably will. the government is sending us back with all these precautions, probably says something about the situation. if this much is necessary, maybe we shouldn't be going back??

Trust me, I love school. no sarcasm there. the people are okay and the work is okay. but it's a terrible idea. Online worked fine before. It's not fair to anyone, ESPECIALLY the teachers who are forced to do it or starve. Good luck to you guys. I really hope it turns out okay for y'all. you do amazing work 💖",2020-08-04 05:24:23

Ya minimum wage needs to be fixed for adults. And we are the ones who have to change it. We. Me, and you reading this. Whoever ya are. We can change this country for the better.

May the brainwashing of our children and citizens end and may we figuratively pour the cup of their deception back to them and call it a good thing. Blessed with the gift of speech to reach each man, woman, child, on every street throughout the United States, but they don’t advertise this. See, media has been their access point of influence over us. Those companies should ALL Be for public benefit and NOT AT ALL allowed to be controlling over us. They’ve sold us terrible trends, trash music, trash media for years. And decades. The state of the world has been easy to reflect off with suggestion to push trends on the masses for a long time. Information of which Kings and Rulers knew and wished they could reach have been easily available to my generation and overlooked by many of them.

No more corporate greed selling us trends and misleading and harming many lives for money and power and projecting it through our television screens from far away. If you feel like you’ve been living in a house of mirrors, you’ve possibly got a little bit of Platos cave mixed in there too.

No shit, you wouldn’t be doing the mental gymnastics claiming that mask wearing amd vaccines is somehow against personal freedoms if you weren’t. But glad you’re willing to admit it here on a public forum.

>	the country itself hasn’t deemed it a mandate 

We shouldn’t have to mandate something so basic and obvious to the well being of all, we like to hope that people are *educated* and *unselfish* to do it without bitching about it somehow being “aGaInsT mY fReeDoM”. 

It’s people like you who make it so we even have to consider such a thing. 

>	if believing in personal freedom is selfish and ignorant then that’s what you’ll have to see me as

loed7n,"That deifintely is an issue, and it causes a sterotype of people from poorer areas being less intelligent. I’m not from america (I’d thank god but there isn’t one) bur where i live is generally looked down on. I went out with a girl from cardiff and although her friends became mine, they have blatantly told me and my friends we were less intelligent and educated because we were from the valleys and they lived in cardiff. They’re families would do it too, and worse. I was allowed to come to them and stay in their houses or whatever, but they weren’t allowed to merthyr because apparently they would ‘get sold into sex traffic rings’?! I have to point out that cardiff has a higher crime rate, and higher rates of child abuse, so it was also hypocritical. When my family met hers they talked to them like they were kids. Bilittled their jobs, affer assuming they didn’t have any (which again i need to point out, most of her family weren’t working or had low paying labour jobs, so again very hippocritical). My mother got a bit fed up of it when one of them said ‘well i actually here merthyr is starting to getting better now’ and passively agressively said ‘yeah we’ve even got electricity now!’, but it backfired a bit when he replied with a genuine ‘oh that’s really good’. It doesn’t help when you have a thick accent, some people just seem to be incapable of takimg you seriously because their prejudices are reminded to them every word that we say differently. So strongly that most people genuinely can’t help but interuot you to mimic your accent, whether they’re complete strangers or not.

yp4ebr,"Voting in person in rural NY state (edge of a blue county, in a fairly red rural area) wasn't bad. 
Walk in, and the guy at the front desk asked if I knew which district I was voting in (my local town has like, 8 of them, I guess? Maybe to make it easy to split up for poll workers.) I told him that I forgot, because I had. I was coming back from dropping my son off at daycare and didn't have my voter registration card. He asked, I said no, and explained. He asked for my address, so I gave it to him, he looked it up, told me my district, but gave me a bit of a suspicious look. I was a little annoyed, but maybe I'm just being paranoid.

Not super busy, except for my particular district. Someone a few people was having an issue, because she had just changed her address at the DMV 2 weeks ago, and apparently it hadn't gone through. No worries, they gave her an affadavit, explained it to her, and she was on her way.

They scanned my ""enhanced license"" that I'm now required to have for domestic travel and to cross the border to Canada, if I so choose, but it didn't come up. I got it just before my license expired in July, so that should have been plenty of time to get things updated. It works when scanning it to buy beer. 🤷🏻 She had to take my license and enter my info manually, but asked if my first name was ""_____""... Nope. That's my middle name. Format on the license is:
LASTNAME
FIRSTNAME,MIDDLENAME
Awkward, but I get it. Maybe that is because I know my name, and can make it make sense? Anyway, she said something about ""oh, the comma is in a weird spot"". Whatever, lady... I'm sure it is correct, I'm sure it is accurate, please let me sign so I can vote. And that's what happened next.

Meanwhile:

Neither the Greeks or the Romans had a concept of homosexuality or heterosexuality.
Men were assumed to be attracted to both males and females, and to express a preference for just one sex was considered eccentric.
They also practiced Pederasty aka older man with a younger male in a romantic relationship, similar to a Daddy dom with a Sugarbaby sub. Because there was no way the older male should be penetrated by someone his junior.... the shame alone was punishment enough. XD


And then you have Zeus... who would fuck whatever caught his fancy. Hermes who had sex with his dog which gave birth to Cerberus... you know... the 3 headed dog Hades has as a pet that he named Cerberus which literally means spot or spotted.
Artemis was called a virgin goddess but she was never actually a virgin... nor did she ever stay a virgin.

Kind of interesting what wiki has on it:

Greek society did not distinguish sexual desire or behavior by the gender of the participants, but rather by the role that each participant played in the sex act, that of active penetrator or passive penetrated.[7] Within the traditions of pederasty, active/passive polarization corresponded with dominant and submissive social roles: the active (penetrative) role was associated with masculinity, higher social status, and adulthood, while the passive role was associated with femininity, lower social status, and youth",2021-12-23 18:38:45

No that says the government can't force companies to have vaccine mandates, not that companies can't have mandates if they so choose.

Many 18 year olds are hardly adults. They arent fully developed and they can be immature and naive. Aoc laws exist to keep children from being coerced, groomed and abused into sex with those with more power over them. Its not because some magic transformation takes place to where if you have sex with a 17 year old it destroys their lives forever but if they turn 18 5 seconds later then no trauma happens at all because that's totally how it works. Legality is not morality.morally, Fucking an 18 year old when you are significantly older is as bad as fucking a 17 year old. They are bad for the same moral reason. I don't care if its legal.

117l9qm,"Christians are very well-primed to accept horrible things happening to children for the sake of faith.

There's this convenient story in the Bible of this guy Abraham, a very pious, faithful, God-fearing man. One day, God appears to Abraham and no shit straight up tells Abraham to prove his faith by sacrificing HIS OWN SON to Him.

And fucking Abraham went ahead and told his son, ""Come, we're gonna make a sacrifice to God."" And the son was like, ok which animal are we bringing? And Abraham was all mysterious like, ""God will provide."" Cool. False pretenses. Lying is a sin, Abraham. But probably not as much as killing your own son.

When they got up the mountain, this bish tied up his son and was literally about to STAB him to DEATH to sacrifice him to this asshole God. God was like, ""Oh shit you really were gunna? Stop bro, siiiike, you don't actually have to, I just wanted to see if you were dedicated enough to me lol. You passed the vibe check 🥳""

And then God pointed to a nearby ram and told Abraham to sacrifice that instead, and everyone was happy and nobody ever mentioned the lasting psychological trauma doubtlessly inflicted upon Abraham's son for being betrayed and watching his dad nearly MURDER him.

Moral of the story is: Fuck dem kids.",2023-02-21 00:36:21

bp28ri,"We agree on a few things. Your wood chipper idea is one I've voiced many times. I think child rapists should be fed in like a yoyo, feet first, back and forth ever so gradually. I'm a mother of two boys and have a couple of granddaughters. I'm pretty fond of my daughters-in-law, too. 😊

I disagree vehemently with your Holocaust analogy. Unlike the Jews, embryos aren't fully formed, sentient human beings. They don't do anything for anyone, nobody relies on them, they can't survive outside of the womb. The woman carrying them *is* a complete person who loves/is loved. She has responsibilities, she may already have children to tend, she's everything that the embryo has the *potential* to become.

Nature often kills them off without the woman ever being aware that she was pregnant -- she just thinks her period is late and heavier than normal. We know that 15-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage based on patients who go to the doctor but that figure is much lower than the reality due to the ones that go unreported. 

Did you know that fetuses can't even *feel pain* until they're nearing viability, around 22-23 weeks? That's when the synapses that complete the nervous system are formed.

I've lived a long life and seen a lot of things, including what it was like before Roe v Wade. Know what's funny? Back then the only people who had a problem with abortion were Catholics. Politicians didn't care, the vast majority of evangelicals didn't make a peep and girls from families who were able to afford it could have an abortion safely, in a hospital, under the guise of another surgery. It was only the working class and the poor who had the back alley abortions.

I knew a girl in school who was raped by a drunk family member at age 13 and became pregnant. The family was Roman Catholic so she was forced to carry to term. She was always sweet and mischievous with a smile for everyone before. She became morose and even suicidal at one point. She told me she'd have been able to move forward if she'd aborted, but the constant reminder was too much. There'd soon be a baby out there that would look like *him* and she dreaded ever setting eyes on *it*. She married and had at least one child, but she disowned most of her family and moved to the opposite coast because she was forced to have a rape/incest baby.",2019-05-17 03:56:21
bp28ri,"🙄.... 

Development stage. 


Look, forcing some shit person who can't be responsible enough to use fucking birth control to have a baby is retarded. The child isn't going to be properly taken care of. It will more than likely grow up to be a criminal. Saying ""well I'm sure some lovely family will adopt it"" NO, man... MOST children in foster care age out. Meaning they are never adopted. They bounce around the foster care system until their 18. And most of them are either physically sexually and/or mentally abused before they get to 18.

As long as they’re drug free and the other baby doesn’t have complications (dairy/soy/egg intolerances) it’s a very safe alternative. If baby does have intolerances there are women who have altered their diets so their breastmilk doesn’t contain those allergens too so it’s still worth reaching out.

It’s no big deal to be disliked by a specific subset of an extremely narrow demographic. 

That’s fine.

If you really think that being mass-downvoted on a Reddit post means that someone is universally-disliked, that only points to how much inexperience you have with the adult world.

You’ll learn, eventually. At some point, you might even learn to retort with rational disagreements rather than trying to call someone names or tell them that nobody likes them. Give it time, and those immature middle-school habits of yours will eventually fade. Most people who are like me were just like you before we knew any better. See you on the other side. 😉

P.S., Maybe you should put some effort into learning to tolerate disagreement. Then you could start to open up your mind a bit, since you would no longer be confined solely to “safe spaces” that you’ve specifically selected to be told what you want to hear.

By allowing the perpetrator to continue attending school with special Ed students, minors, and anyone weaker than him (it’s better now, he’s being watched now, boys will be boys 🙃) and not trying and jailing him—they are unleashing a monster on the public—no record—no sex offender registration, no jail time—just freedom to do this to someone else and probably several people.  

This is worse than rewarding bullies—this is aiding and abetting violent criminals who prey on the vulnerable.

Aside from the initial nurse office visit, everything this school from the neglect of the victim to the letting the rapist stay to the coverup and lies and sweeping this under the rug did was WRONG, CRIMINALLY wrong and puts others in danger.

Not reporting a rape should be a punishable crime. If it is your job to investigate and bring justice—do your damn job.

l4a412,"Fixed your comment..

🖕🏼You really have to be willfully ignorant not to understand the fallacious comparison of a series of events like rioting over extrajudicial killing of minorities which resulted in 10,000 arrests.  Or a president who incited a seditious conspiracy and insurrection on our nations capital with the hopes of overturning a presidential election by using violence and force.  All based on the presidents relentless, repeated trumpeting of a conspiracy that the election was stolen. Yet could never  produce any demonstrable evidence. After exhausting all failed legal attempts. All court complaints were either thrown out for lack of merit or just simply refused to be heard by the SCOTUS, some of which are trump appointees, trump and Republican appointed Federal and State Judges, Republican trump supporting governors, and Republican appointed state election committees.  And tons of other inflammatory actions from trump. Such as tweeting videos where right wing zealots stated “ the only good democrat is a dead democrat.” Calling neo nazis “good people” stating the press and democrats are “the enemy of the people” and encouraging his followers to fight and fight like hell immediately before the failed coup. You’d also have to ignore the death and destruction and accept a president who conspired to commit sedition, and an insurrection while saying rioting to protest extrajudicial killing is wrong. 
Trump, those in congress who enabled such an attack on our democracy and on our nations capital and those who refuse to hold Trump and those officials accountable. Are so maliciously ignorant as they wipe their asses with our constitution.",2021-01-25 04:33:38

That's incitement.  Watch Maxine Water or numerous others incite their people to go commit violence. The Dems and their media apparatus created a powder keg and told their supporters to destroy property, that it wasn't violence to do so FOR MONTHS. 19 unarmed black people were killed by cops in 2019  that's a 1 in OVER 1 million shot if you're black you'd be unlawfully killed.

So for this to work, you have to stop being such snide little snake like bastards. It's a two way street. We're not going to condone what you did, were not going to coddle you, were going to try to stop being assholes to each other first. But in no way does that mean all that shit gets a free pass. I am convinced that for anything to happen republicans are going to have eventually look in a mirror instead of  deflecting to antifa or whatever every time.

And the angrier the tweet, the more chance of me using it and turning it to laughs and cash. PC culture isn’t killing comedy. It’s driving it. As it always did 🙏”

a7epbn,"From a small town. Can confirm. 

I always thought it was interesting... like my husband and I were partiers in our late teens early twenties... and I don’t just mean drinking and smoking pot. Nothing like meth/crack/heroin or anything. But still dabbled in some advanced recreational activities. 

But when it came to having jobs and being responsible, that was just never a problem for us. We partied hard on the weekends and lead semi regular lives during the work week with occasional weeknight drinks. And once we needed all our funds for other things and we got older... we just walked away from all of that. It was no big deal to us. Like it was fun but it was time to grow up and be responsible all the time, not just during the week. 

But boy. Whew. The people we partied hard with did not fair well. They either died, OD’ed, ended up in rehab, or have graduated to full on junkies. We are no longer surprised to hear an old friend is addicted to H or whatnot. 

What made us be the type that could walk away? We aren’t special. I told my husband it’s got to be a DNA trait or something. I partied way harder than some of them back in the day. I felt like I’ve always been prone to addiction of some sort but still, it was so easy to walk away from all of that.

Update to the update:  It looks like it really is accurate but the text about him being worried that his son was gay didn't make the text of the story.

SAN DIEGO — Until six months ago, [Aaron Brink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Brink) thought his son died by suicide.

Brink said his ex-wife called him from Colorado in 2016 to tell him their son, Nicholas Brink, had changed his name to Anderson Aldrich, and had killed himself.

“I thought he was dead. I mourned his loss. I had gone through a meltdown and thought I had lost my son,” Brink told CBS 8.

When Brink asked his ex-wife why their son had changed his name, she blamed it on the father’s involvement in a reality TV show called Intervention, as well as his acting career in the adult film industry.

“His mother told me he changed his name because I was in Intervention and I had been a porno actor,” said Brink.

For six years Brink believed his son was dead, until Aldrich unexpectedly called his father six months ago, and started arguing with him over the phone.

“He’s pissed off. He's pissed off at me. He wants to poke at the old man,” Brink recalled.

Then, two days ago, Brink got a call from his son's defense attorneys, telling him Aldrich was involved in a shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs.

Brink said he's a Mormon and his first reaction was to question why his son was at a gay bar.

“You know Mormons don't do gay. We don't do gay. There's no gays in the Mormon church. We don't do gay,” Brink said.

But when the 48-year-old learned more details of the deadly shooting, he said he was shocked.

“There's no excuse for going and killing people. If you're killing people, there's something wrong. It's not the answer,” he said.

Brink told CBS 8 his son was born in San Diego in 2000, at Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women. The couple lived in Cardiff by the Sea at the time, but soon separated about a year later and got divorced.

He said his ex-wife, the [daughter of California State Assemblyman Randy Voepel](https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/national/report-accused-colorado-springs-shooter-is-grandson-of-california-assemblyman-randy-voepel/509-8ff71925-2d7a-40b5-8acb-d021a7b35b38), and his son moved to Colorado around 2012.

Brink currently works as a mixed martial arts coach. He says he taught his son how to fight.

“I praised him for violent behavior really early. I told him it works. It is instant and you'll get immediate results,” the father said.

But in the wake of the violence at Club Q, Brink apologized to the families of the victims.

“I’m sorry for your loss.  Life is so fragile and it's valuable. Those people's lives were valuable. You know, they’re valuable. They’re good people probably.  It's not something you kill somebody over. I'm sorry I let my son down,” he said.

“I love my son no matter what. I love my son,” Brink said. “Please forgive my son.”",2022-11-23 20:41:50

p0zl9e,"FYI having kids doesn't count.

In fact, you are more of an adult for not having a kid. It's similar to drinking (sex) and not getting into a car completely wasted (no birth control) and killing someone (your own life).

On that note (and only that note 😆), I guess I've been an adult since like 10 years old, when no one believed me and kept telling me you'll want kids when you're older. (I broke it off with my fiance who apparently also didn't believe me, which I found out when I got a vasectomy.) Translation for half of them: You'll probably fuck up like we did when you're older.

So while I understand having a kid dwarfs most other shit, you did it to yourself. It's such a huge decision that I don't know how so many people fuck up. I'd rather rob a bank.",2021-08-09 15:48:08

zeh8to,"From what I can tell, it calls for the establishment of a committee to find out the extent of the problem (to the tune of $27M according to the CBO) and then a whole new bureaucracy to deal with it. It’s pretty apparent based on the reading I’ve done that these deportations happened because the veterans in question ran afoul of the law (I’m not saying justifiably) before they had completed their naturalization process. The sad fact is nobody knows how many and which veterans have actually been affected, and it does appear the bill attempts to address this, albeit in a seemingly inefficient manner over 5 years. It also mentions nothing about support for these vets following discharge, or during appeal. 

IANAL😉, but it seems to me that a serious piece of legislation would include the automatic naturalization of noncitizen armed forces members at discharge or ETS. It could also simply call on the JAG corp and ICE to expedite any existing appeal and create an expedited process for new appeals, OR, just make it illegal to deport a veteran. And if Congress were truly concerned about these vets, they’d find a way to expedite treatment of their issues. The good things in this bill are unfortunately buried in muddy bureaucratic language under a pile of unnecessary code and half-measures. If any legislation could simply be an executive order, it sure seems like this should be. If I were a vet, I’d be disappointed. Not necessarily because this legislation didn’t pass, but because the piece of legislation itself seems to be a pretty pathetic political ploy that, if passed, wouldn’t have done much, except for a small and seemingly very specific subset.

When/ if it goes away or well back to normal or in the case of North Dakota wanting to cancel the federal assistance next month then things will go back to the way they were I assume which sucks. I'm an electrician and I make a decent wage. I dont have health insurance though which sucks but luckily (and for now) i'm healthy. 

I have been fighting with my trumper family for years about this issue. Employees are an expense and there should be laws enforcing livable wages or else.. you can't have employees.

They bitch about people staying on unemployment instead of returning to their 7.50$/ hr job. No shit? Wonder why? Our taxes all pay for the assistance min wage people use like foodstamps etc. Why are we paying for these companies employees instead of them paying for it? They are basically complaining that people are living off the government and not returning to their jobs that end up leaving them to.. live off the government. Wtf why are they so blind to this fact?

I like my job sure but I was never inherentley or mechanically inclined.. so to speak. I pride myself on being able to learn anything if someones good enough to teach it and I was able to learn electrical from small crews of guys willing to teach. 

But my favorite job I've had in my time? Security guard  , unarmed. Sounds dumb I know but I was lucky to work for a decent company and at a location with very nice and generous people. The only drawback was it paid 10$/ hour. That was ten years ago in Southern California. I had a car that was paid off at the time and a small studio apartment in a run down but safe area and I made due. Until the car started falling apart. On 10$ hr a car payment and rent is easily more than one of your paychecks. That was 10 years ago and the job pays maybe 11$/hr now last I checked. 

Things cant go on like this anymore. Things need to change. I am grateful for the skills I have now and love doing work for friends and family and especially myself.. But I would rather be doing something else. Lol i'm way too liberal for the blue collar crowd honestly. I have to bite my tounge so much when i'm at work with these guys, its exhausting.

They think low wage workers shouldn't get a boost because they wont. No everyone deserves to make more. Everyone is likely underpaid nowadays and have been for a long time. 

Maybe i'm crazy but if I were to start a business I would be paying my employees the best that I could so they would appreciate the job and company they work for and hell if they are happy and content... things will only get better for you. Fast food places always make me 🤦🤦🤦 with the high turnover.. how much time and money is wasted training new people constantly I wonder vs paying a good wage and retaining employees for longer terms.

You’re ignoring the people getting cancelled for being racist and/ or homophobic when they’re not even racist or homophobic. I 100% agree that racist people should face consequences. Racism of any kind is wrong, shallow, and inexcusable. Same with homophobes. 

We are straying away from my point. The fact that you can’t see that there are people in the Democratic Party that are fascists is just proving my point. Both parties attack each other for the same thing and it’s fucking pathetic. Both Republicans and Democrats act like they are perfect. They both see a bad apple and they glorify it. They act as if the whole party consists of those bad apples. Democrats and Republicans both have the same goal. Yet they’re too busy vilifying the other party, that they fail to solve issues that would otherwise be easy to solve if they work together. This is the reason I left politics. They don’t care about what’s best for everyone. They don’t care about learning. They don’t care about being open to other viewpoints. They’re not open to being incorrect. They care about being right. That’s the problem. People think attacking the other party makes their party seem so much better. That does nothing but cause separation and hatred. Not peace and unity. Think of how powerful this country would be if we all stop the finger pointing and the hatred. Unfortunately, that will likely never happen. Not in my lifetime at least. If both parties hear each others side and realize they have the same goal, while ignoring the assholes who try belittle the other party and cause hate. This country would be unstoppable. 

I’ve said everything I want. You can respond if you want but at this point the conversation will be wasting time for both of us. We can go back and forth on this all day. I hope you and your family stay safe and healthy. 🙏🏽

9w969v,"I work customer service for a furniture store. We have a VERY strict return policy that’s made known before the customer makes a purchase (essentially can’t return anything unless it’s damaged). Had a customer come in wanting to return a sofa that she found uncomfortable. I asked if anything was wrong with it, structurally, making it uncomfortable. 

She goes off on me, saying that it was uncomfortable when she bought it but the sales associate was mean so she purchased any way. I then pointed out that she knew it was uncomfortable and yet she still decided to buy it knowing full well that we don’t take returns. Who spends a few grand on something they didn’t like in the first place that they knew they couldn’t return?? 

Anyway, I say that I could take back the sofa but would have to pay a restocking charge. She starts literally screaming “ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY!” And then screaming about how this company is full of liars and she threatened to get her lawyer involved, etc. 

Hear her husband in the back ask her to calm down, as I was just doing my job. She then proceeds to say that since I choose to work for these “criminals” I am just as bad.

9w969v,"My experience of working in customer service and living in a city that gets a lot of international tourists:

For natives:

70+ are mixed but mostly nice, men tend to be ruder than women.

Baby boomers are awful. Women the worst of any category by a significant margin, even the polite boomers tend to be passive-aggressive even if they aren’t outright rude.

Both Millenials and Gen X are the nicest/easiest to deal with and from my experience very similar groups in general in terms of character and decency.

For tourists:

Japanese people are possibly the nicest, most respectful people on this earth. I’ve met thousands over the years and have yet to see a single rude or disrespectful act from any of them.

White US citizens are a mixed bag, they’re very friendly but their approach to people who work in the service industry is pretty appalling. Though I do realise a big part of this is cultural and not personal. They’re also loud and pretty obnoxious as standard, if I’m honest I always try to view them as children and give them the same allowances because, no offence, in a social context they are mostly children.

Black US citizens are lovely and for some reason don’t behave anything like their white compatriots. Exceedingly considerate, polite to a fault and fun to be around. Not nearly as loud and much more receptive to social cues and subtext in conversation which makes them much better-adapted to function in British society. Their treatment of service staff seems to be much better, still a bit unpleasant if something goes wrong with their order or experience, but nowhere near as rude as white US citizens in my experience.

Canadians put their southern cousins to shame. Excessively polite, friendly and respectful without the constant noise levels and entitled attitude. It sounds horrible but I think of them as the perfect European/American hybrid.

Dutch people I legit cannot get enough of. If it wasn’t for the language being so insurmountable I’d move there in an instant purely based on interactions with Dutch tourists. Such lovely people, always quick to laugh and great company.

Scandinavians are also awesome. Slightly more sober in nature than the Dutch but considerably less sober when on a night out (especially the Finnish I’ve noticed? 😂) but even when imbibed still polite, decent and excellent conversationalists. 

Russians are mostly abrupt, I’d stop short of rude because in truth I think it’s mostly a combination of cultural factors and language barrier. I’d say that Russians generally aren’t intentionally rude or offensive very often, it’s just that they’re rarely friendly. Civil, short responses is about the best you can hope for. They don’t really let their guard down so they’re very closed off making them hard work. Not intentionally difficult, but still difficult.

Polish are lovely, incredibly kind people once they realise you’re not a member of UKIP. It’s specific to the U.K. because we’ve had high levels of migration from Poland but due to this I’ve had a high level of exposure to Polish nationals and once you get past the (completely justified) initial wariness (may not apply elsewhere) they’re awesome people. Very family-oriented and thoroughly decent in my experience.

French are mixed, my experiences with French visitors pretty much mirror the U.K. demographics. Young French people (particularly those from minorities) are lovely to deal with, as are the older generation for the most part. Middle-aged French people less so.

Germans are always lovely and it’s always a joy to have them. They give the Japanese a run for their money on manners and decorum. Having lived in Munich for a few months I’ve had more experience with Germans than most other nationalities and I’ve always held an exceptionally high opinion of the German people as a result.

Singaporeans are less-seen but the few groups I’ve had dealings with have been beyond amazing. I was surprised by how easily they seemed to adapt to our way of doing things and their sheer enthusiasm for embracing another culture is a heart-warming thing to see. Very sincere people.

Chinese are the fucking worst, and to this date the only group on the tourist list that I’ve ever had a physical altercation with. They’re obnoxious, entitled, disrespectful and honestly they seem to lack survival instinct. I’m not a huge guy at 5’11 and 13st but I’ve probably got about 6 inches and 4st on the fucking moron who decided he was going to attempt to walk through me and my girlfriend, then grab me by the throat when I didn’t get out of his way. I’m amazed more of them aren’t seriously injured. 

My dislike for Chinese tourists isn’t based on this one incident, unfortunately we get busloads every day and it’s a constant reinforcement every time those bus doors open. They seem to think they’re invincible, which is an incredibly dangerous attitude to have when you’re visiting a historically warlike nation densely populated by people twice your size who like a drink. 

I’ve seen more than a few violent incidents involving Chinese tourists. There must be something about Chinese culture where shouting and waving your hands about stops people hitting you, it’s a cultural habit we don’t share.

This is all personal opinion and I’m sure I’m wrong about most of it, so if I’ve offended your nation please don’t take it personally I’m sure you’re a star! 😁

One of my favorites was to ask them about their parents, even if they looked a thousand years old, because asking about them (or even Jesus if it was Sunday) got them thinking about how their own elders might act if they saw them behaving this way.

Or it at least kept them jabbering long enough to get the bacon to that oh-so-precious consistency between charcoal dust and soufflé they always seemed to want. 🤣

For real though I don't know his long game plan, but there is one, there must be (again.... RIGHT??). He and the people who manage that type of wealth wouldn't allow Elon to just set that pile of dough on fire.

For example, in Australia, citizens pay about $1200 per person per year in fossil fuel subsidies per year to artificially deflate prices.

You can never own a car, bike everywhere, “vote with your wallet”, it will never change it. It’s political, and people who have no choice are forced to use petrol. Same goes for sugar and a ton of other stuff.

The other thing a lot of armchair activists struggle with is the idea that individualised consumer action (ie boycotts, product choice) actually *reduces will for regulatory change!*

Put simply, if whole populations believe that product choice is enough, they don’t participate in democracy and change it.

I’m absolutely with you on not being defeatist by the way! Organised advocacy works! It works really well! Gather in groups and demand regulatory change. 😁",2020-10-24 21:54:49

Harm reduction IS better than nothing, but I gotta be honest with you. When I hear things like desperately wanting a vehicle that costs as much as a home in some places, I desperately want a huge asteroid to just wipe us all off the face of the earth.

jhe04p,"Okay so... the nice internet argument thing would be to say “you’re right, and here’s a few other things...”

Except I can’t because the position you hold, which I have also held, is factually impossible to back up. 😬 

https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2018/09/what-are-subsidies-basics.htm “[In 2015, Fossil fuel] subsidies were largest in China, at $2.3 trillion, followed by the United States, at $700 billion, and Russia and India, at about $300 billion each.”

If you use a used car, you *still buy petrol.* But think about roads for a second. Consumers don’t buy roads. You can’t buy a cheaper road, there isn’t “road competition.” 

Elected leaders decide where to spend taxpayer money, and they have a *zero sum* choice between say... improving public transport and changing zoning so that cities are more walkable. Proven, works, amazing. Or, building more roads, which spreads populations apart and *forces* us to use cars.

If there is no public transport between the farmers market and where you live, you have no choice but to drive.

Don’t get me wrong, it seemed insane to me as well that consumer choice mattered so little when I first started researching this. Bonkers!

One really simple way to get a grip on whether an approach actually works or not is to see which corporations back it. Nestle *love* exercise policies and non profits because it lets them sell more sugar, which is subsidised more than we subsidise education globally. Super bonkers!

(Btw source for all this is I teach at university and do this for a living! Woot!)",2020-10-24 22:40:43
jhe04p,"Aaaah! Yes now this is the good stuff. 😁

First: You’re absolutely right that there is differences between car types and usage. 

But, the urban planning thing a bit like brushing your teeth, boring, there’s no immediate benefit, and changes are slow.

Changing how much sugar you eat is kinda like “fixing it at the car level”, a more efficient car, maybe an electric car. Etc.

Better urban planning is brushing and flossing. It’s hard to imagine how flossing could remove a rotten tooth (and it doesn’t), but you wouldn’t *stop* brushing because you have a rotten tooth, right?

I think the trick here is that corporations have, for decades, run an intensely well funded, targeted campaign on the stuff that actually works, because buying cars and eating sugar is hella profitable! 

Okay on the voting thing: This is also tricky, but similar to the “just buy a better car” thing. The idea that “just voting” is enough for a healthy democracy is super similar to “just buy they most ethical product” argument, right? Just voting isn’t enough, when there is gerrymandering and smear campaigns and intense lobbying. 

Voting is a good start. But democracy is not a spectator sport.",2020-10-24 23:51:20

m85dh2,"Anyone remember the olden days when you actually initialed your SPECIFIC job requirements, as long as you fulfilled those requirements, you had your job. Great insurance coverage with a small co-pay for office and most medical/dental visits, profit sharing and being made ""salary"" meant that if you completed your duties in 26 hours instead of 40, you got paid the full salary? Now, companies simply make people working overtime for extra money ""salaried"" but expected to do as much of more with than on overtime, no regulated hours. Most people only have HSA insurance, meaning a simple office visit for pneumonia immediately costs $200 out of pocket, after a discount. I had my son on 2001, he was a preemie, 2 weeks in NICU, less than $500 out of pocket. You could rent a NICE 2 bedroom apartment for about $650. Buy a nice house for $110k. The pendulum in our country has been stuck so far right for so long trying to drive down education, manufacturing costs, wages for so long in the USA, that people see any near middle shift, idea, as ""radical left"" and fear it, fight against it, even if it's for they're own benefit.

PS: even entry level/part time receptionist positions starting at $10.50/hr are requesting bachelor degrees, bookkeeping skills?? general labor openings are usually only second or third shift?? Experience used to matter, but now with the automated services, your resume is sorted out by degree, age first, not actual skills and experience. My worst experience was back in 2008, I'd been building websites, social media, lots of experience in sales, created databases, etc. Years of great reviews, my accomplishments (used to be easy to find new jobs doing the things I liked doing, better pay, etc) had copies of, 2008, it was gone. The company/job of been working towards got sold.2 days after an awesome review and raise!

After almost a year of really crappy temp jobs (single mom) I got an interview with a local company, had already whipped up a draft of what their website could be, , etc. The younger lady interviewing me was pissed ( wouldn't even go online to view my draft) because even though I had gone to college, I didn't actually have my bachelor's degree, put me in a room to do a timed math test of like 50 questions. During my intital interview (if I'd had a little longer, I could've built a database to do it in seconds). I did okay, only missed a few, but she reemed me out for not having a degree right after.

m85dh2,"The America you love has always existed, and it’s also always been under siege. All the way back to the Constitutional Convention. There are those of us who hold the truths to be self evident and do not exclude anyone from the category of rights holders. There have also always been those who recognized they could profit from creating and promoting out groups. 

It’s easy to despair. But remember that at every single pivotal turn, those who believe in the self evident truths have prevailed and taken the next step forward. We even fought the worst war in our history over it and won. 

The right enjoy talking about the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of Patriots. Thing is, they are right. And we took to the streets and bled as brothers and sisters this summer to oppose police brutality. We ushered in two blue waves and immediately demanded accountability from those we elected.

The battle for equality goes on, we must endlessly take the next step. But never lose sight that we do take those steps. The only way to take them is for enough of us to hold onto our love of the simple truth of equality.  From Yorktown to Appomattox, on to Selma and *Windsor*. 

Patriotism is not blind loyalty. It is vigilance and resolve. 

“My country always, my government only when it deserves it.”

Don’t forget: Republicans have only won the popular vote once in 30 years, and that on an incumbency in the middle of a “he handled a transformative crisis” wave before the mass understanding that he did not in fact handle that crisis emerged. The nation you love is not gone, the majority believe in it. A minority faction is attempting to use institutions to steal it from us. 

No justice, no peace. 

Give me Liberty or give me death. 

Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for it. 

That these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. 

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.

These are not cliche or platitude. These are the stakes. Do not despair, do not falter. Fight for those heroes of equality who came before us. Fight for the disadvantaged today and tomorrow who cannot fight. Fight for those who we failed.

So long as one person is unequal, no one is equal. 🇺🇸",2021-03-19 05:30:32

My previous boss was the same. The president of the company really liked me, and everyone else did too. I made friends really quickly with the girls there, and got constant compliments and thought everything was great. We got drinks after work, had great company outings, etc.

I caught her actively changing my directives after I had completed projects to intentionally make it look like I had left information out or not followed instructions. She didn’t know I could see her actively typing and editing the document. I know this because when we first started using the program, I asked her if I would be able to see her Live, like how Google Documents allows live interactions on stuff, which we utilized all day. She said “don’t worry, you’ll just get the end product of what you’re supposed to do.”

Joke was on her. I watched her editing one of my directives and she typoed a word. I said out loud, “oh that’s too funny! I spell that word wrong too!”

I’m not kidding she literally turned bright red and left the office for the day. 

She couldn’t STAND me for the same things she hired me for. “I love that you’re outspoken”. DO YOU? YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? “We need a team member who isn’t afraid to share their opinion”. I can promise you that is never, EVER the case 🤣

One time the president of the company had me pick up a flower arrangement for his wife. My boss fucking lost it. Part of my job was to be his personal assistant and she was like (loudly) “why would he send YOU to get her flowers?” I was like!???!!!!

tf5r26,"I believe you can, especially since it is for you to grow and not for him. I remember in my early 20s when one of my friends offhandedly said to me “you are always so angry…” and I realized how much I had let my past drive me into a person I didn’t want to become. I realized my dad was the way that he always had been because of his hatred for his own father, his own past. It had defined his character, and the cycle of abuse and hate had then been forced onto me as his son. By choosing to forgive him and letting go of the hatred I broke the cycle and it transformed me into a person who tries to always love above anything else. It’s not easy, it’s always an ongoing challenge - I still struggle with the memories and wounds of my past; but I don’t let it define me. My past made me impossibly strong, but I can choose to not let it make me hard.

m96nsd,"This is going to be unpopular but I haven’t seen a benefit to the unions I’ve worked in and around.  

I was forced to be part of of a union at a hotel.  I didn’t work enough hours to earn representation from the union but was still forced to pay dues! 🤔

I worked for a company where factory workers were in a union.  There was lots of hard workers, but there was also plenty of people that took advantage of it being a union shop.  They would do almost no work and complain when someone challenged them on not doing anything.  

Workers who were not nearly qualified for jobs could bid into them based on seniority not skill.  

We had regular voluntary layoffs that senior employees got first go at.  They would bid into another job for the seniority just to get laid off.  If they didn’t get the layoff they would bid to another job until they did.

They would flat out refuse to do work.  When a non union employee would go do what the union refused to do, they filed a grievance.  A non union employees wasn’t allowed to do something the union could do!

We went from a 3 point system to a 12 point system.  They also introduced half and quarter points depending on what rule they broke.  After 6 months you “earned” the point back.  There was plenty of “workers” that rode that line having 11-11.75 points just to earn one back and then not show up the next day because they could!

Bottom line, if your company treats you poorly and a union is needed for employees to be treated fair and not taken advantage of, I’m for it!  If that same union allows employees to be complete fuck offs then I’m not for it!  Anyone should be able to be reprimanded and/or fired for not doing their job period!",2021-03-20 21:00:53

m96nsd,"I went from working at a land grant university where I made less than $12.00 an hour with terrible benefits *after* going there for 15 years to a union job where I started at $18.00 an hour with incredible benefits.  I paid about $80.00 in union dues to get a 50% raise with benefits that are out of this world.  My union dues were nothing compared to what I got in exchange for them.

In addition union members stick with their jobs which is a boon to employers.  At Walmart they have a corporate goal of 100% employee turnover in a year.  How do you think 100% turnover affects production?  🤪",2021-03-20 18:04:49
m96nsd,"Yeah. I was told a few months after I was hired that while I didn't have to join the union and pay dues, they'd give my position to someone that will pay. In the 2 years I was there dues doubled then tripled to something like $295 a paycheck (I remember it was a hair under 300). And instead of getting our shoes paid for like they (the union reps) promised, they wanted us to sing their praises over a TEN CENT RAISE. 
That's an AMAZING $16 /month or $192 /year raise! In exchange for that FANTASTIC raise I only had to pay an increase in my monthly dues of about $200! :0
Healthcare for me and my wife? Another $300 a month. 

Looking back I now see how I was barely scraping by even though I was making $15 an hour and by all logic should have been able to have a savings account. I didn't spend money going out and could afford to go out on rare occasion. I could never figure out where all my money went.

m96nsd,"How are unions not common sense? Your workforce has security and can vote on ethics issues. If the people you're hiring collectively decide you're treating them unfairly, then you're probably treating them unfairly.

The issue comes in with police because *surprise* 🥳  they kill people. That's not an oopsie for a union to deal with, that's a real problem.

If an Amazon warehouse worker kills me, it's not because of their job. If a cop kills me, it was because it's their job, unions shouldnt shield them from malpractice, especially because the loss of human life is a core principal in ethics as a baseline *negative*.

I'd absolutely support dissolving the police union to let departments handle issues IF it didn't set prescedent bad actors would use to attack legitimate unions that work for the benefit of their workers. That's the whole issue, police unions are a parasite we've let grow and now we can't cut it out without taking several other things with it.

What if we protected vulnerable workers and didn't protect the people with the ability to take a human life? It's crazy but it's almost like the lack of protection would change their behavior over time and make them more hesitant to flippantly take a human life. Crazy concept.",2021-03-20 16:40:47

rf24ak,"Grew up in a factory town that one rich guy tried hard to make into a destination tourist small city, complete with a tiny little neighborhood of houses that looked like small castles and his flagship ""4- star"" restaurant in the gasping for breath downtown....

I was a small town farm girl who felt lucky to get hired on after my Red Lobster gig. My clients were all the lawyers and doctors in town, and the servers were all the tiny slice of rich kids in the area...90s vegans who followed Rusted Root. I did. Not. Fit. In.  I was just trying to make my cash for diapers and daycare. 

But I met a lot of cool people, came home late a lot of times, especially when some young lawyer would tip me $100 on a bottle of Dom and then ask me just to sit and drink it after shift. The cooks gifted me tiny bags of pot that I gave to my best friend, and I covered tables when the other waitresses were out back smoking crack...""to lose weight"" 🤷🏻‍♀️ It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... we were all kinda naive, I think. But the kitchen staff made it all worthwhile!!! AND THE PARTIES AT THE CHEFS HOUSE AFTER SHIFTS WERE SO MUCH FUN!!! I never got stoned, it just wasn't my thing, but I LOVED laying on the living room floor with the cooks watching Liquid Television and Aeon Flux!!!!!! 🥰

TL/DR this just made me happy remembering my time working in a restaurant and all the fun times, from the young chef shacked up with the hot server, to the stoned dish guy, the sous chef who couldn't read but was an amazing cook, the line cook married to the waitress who was always out back doing drugs, etc etc etc. Good times and good money",2021-12-13 07:33:13

And these idiots actively praise them for it

On the flip side of humanity, I work in an area that got caught in the heat domes this year, during that week if it got over 90 in the building they gave breaks every hour, and actively encouraged us to stop what we're doing and drink plenty of water whenever we felt the need to do so, and went and bought and filled a massive cooler with a ton of water and all manner of drinks

The two days it got over 100? Immediately shut down. Everyone go home, paid day off without the need to use your personal PTO

It will never cease to amaze me that there's people out there who praise those who see this precautions and caring as a bad thing. Then again, they would probably also be disgusted that we will take kids fresh out of high school and start them at $17/h with full benefits for the shift I'm on, something something stepping stone jobs that will take anyone (not in food or retail or any of those traditional ""shit on the workers"" jobs)

You know what these actions have caused? An incredibly happy group of people working under me, massively high productivity that has allowed this little local business to start expansions to basically double the staff, and incredibly low levels of employee turnover, with virtually no one at much as taking unnecessary sick days or whatever

And these people want nothing more than for you to believe these things are impossible, and that they will destroy small businesses if they're asked to do so. Meanwhile we are a shining example of how incredibly well businesses can succeed if the people who own it are willing to take a bump in profits in the short term, to build an incredibly successful business with happy and productive employees in the long term. You could not ask for better or happier or more productive employees than what we have, because they're treated like humans, and aren't nickled and dimed for a quick buck, and we're talked about as one of the absolute best places in the area to work, with so many applications flooding in that people are actively waiting to be hired on, on a list. While I constantly see other people around town talking about how short staffed they are, and how ""nobody wants to work""

Crazy how in these awful times of where ""nobody wants to work"" the ones who pay a living wage and treat people incredibly well literally cannot expand fast enough to hire everyone who wants to be here, the places paying and treating people in the lowest possible manner can't seem to find anyone, I wonder what the difference is that's causing people to flock to us, while they struggle to keep their doors open.

I originally asked you to explain why you view economics as a whole (as a social science) is bullshit and you deflected by asking another question.

You’re right that many statisticians could perform the data-related work econometricians do, but statisticians aren’t trained as well, if at all, to extrapolate the information into the real world environment it needs to be applied to for policy recommendations. 

Now regarding M4A, you must be daft. You’re saying no analysis, or basically no forward thought, should be performed prior to implementing the policy. That’s absolutely ridiculous. It’s not as simple as you’re making it out to be and if you truly want the policy to be as effective as possible, why would you not want to take a thorough, well thought out approach? 

To me it seems like you’re just an angry, frustrated individual that pursued an undergraduate econ degree they didn’t end up enjoying.

The scope of the argument is even greater, however. It implies you should be legally allowed to kick your children out of your house at any point in their lives (even if they're 3 months old) which, again, is a fair argument worth exploring further.

n6gtzu,"Be careful with that. My brother is two years older than me and did that to me as a kid. I was a very happy Christian and he was leaving Christianity. He grew up fast, we were only like 12 and 14. I never had read the Bible but was using my faith to Navigate life. Now I'm no fool, and I am always ready to change. When he did that to me I was like ""Oh dude what? really?"" It was good because it launched me into Questioning what I was being taught, and realizing a lot of what I thought felt wrong, was. But. It also made me extremely depressed when things came along I couldn't quite explain for a really long time. Like throwing a stick in someone's bicycle spokes. Eventually, I came to terms with the fact that I can believe whatever the hell I want. I still believe in a God, I still believe in a form of Heaven, but I believe in what makes sense to me, not what some poorly translated book written by some random person said happened.

Be careful with your words though, because you never know what is keeping someone afloat. You don't know if that person can bounce back. There are much better ways to help your friends and family healthily question if that is what they truly believe.

Edit: lol for people with a need to make people Question themselves, you don't much want to listen to others and their experiences. Or maybe because I said I still believed in A God, but whatever lol, I'm leaving this up because maybe it'll help someone.

⭐ A lot of people only read like 5 words so here's a TLDR...
TLDR: Be careful how you go about making someone question their religion if you feel it's necessary, because going from having an understanding of the world to none at all can be really really bad. There are much better ways. 

A lot of people build their life on their religion. You shouldn't just demolish someones house without helping them move first.

Extreme agitation and aggression, which I’ve also seen firsthand in a couple of friends, but which disappeared completely when switching.

>When I was a teenager, I spent a lot of time on /b/, /pol/, 888chan, etc. It was a slow descent and I didn't even realize what was happening until it was almost too late.

>But during my time on the other side, this was 100% the gameplan. They'd make ""sock puppets"" and coordinate on the board + IRC (showing my age here) to selectively choose targets to brigade.

>Depending on the target, you'd either have some talking points to ""debate"" (sometimes with yourself/other anons working alongside you) or you'd go in there guns blazing trying to cause as much damage/chaos as you can. However, even then you can't go out there yelling slurs (you'd just get banned instantly); you have to maintain some level of plausible deniability by framing things as ""jokes"" or thought experiments.

>You purposely do bad-faith arguments because the time it takes for them to dig up sources and refute you is longer than it takes for you to make stuff up. You can vary how obvious the bad faith argument is; when you want to troll you make very stupid claims (I once claimed I was a graduate of ""Harvad University"" and when people assumed that I meant ""Harvard"" I would correct them right down to Photoshopped images).

>When you just want to cause dissent you do exactly what those /pol/ screenshots do: you get to a thread early (sometimes you even make it yourself) and present reasonable-sounding arguments which are completely false if anyone bothers to look into them. If someone does, you bury the message under strawmen, downvotes, reports, and sockpuppets.

>So yeah. The tactics have evolved slightly, but I still recognize them. Props to you on doing the digging to find all this stuff and bring it into the light.

>I doubt that it'll help in the majority of cases, mind. People on Reddit have already made up their mind. You want to go after the forums and BBSes, on the MSN News comments and whatnot.

I hurt my foot pretty bad a few months ago but it’s so expensive to get checked out I had to just say fuck it and deal with it. My insurance covers nothing except a single yearly flu shot, and even that they fight tooth and nail to avoid paying for. Otherwise I have to pay out of pocket until I’ve paid $5,000, at which point they’ll cover I believe half of my medical expenses.

Thankfully I’m a mostly healthy young person, but it still sucks having to live a lifestyle of “avoid medical help unless you have no choice.” I can only imagine what it would be like to go get health problems checked out without having to fear the cost.  

That’s nothing compared to others in the US though, some people go nearly bankrupt from having a child. Nothing like a $30,000 bill from the hospital to celebrate your new baby! 🎉  followed by no guaranteed parental leave from work",2021-07-26 23:02:36

I needed “First Responder Advanced Life Support” (injection of some medicine by the qualified paramedic onboard). That was another $500 for somebody to give me medication that penetrated my skin.

o5k2d6,"I'll go ahead and preface this by saying that I'm pro gun ownership with some regulation. I don't believe we should have to have a shooting test, but I think there is a large benefit to it. If you want a concealed carry license or a hunting license then you do have to have a hunters safety course which includes gun safety. I don't believe someone who has a handgun in their home stashed away in case of emergency should have to learn to shoot though. 

Well we as Americans in our bill of rights have something called the right to bear arms. It's the 2nd amendment. Basically the history behind this was it was created so that the US would not have to have a standing military except in times of war. States wanted the right to police themselves instead of a military. One of the two parties at the time the anti federalists did not trust the US military to have so much control (the party was anti big government). There has been strong debate over the issue on what the amendment actually means. Some believe the wording means that it's for organized groups like the national guard and other believe every citizen has the right. This is a very very simplified version of the history of the 2nd amendment. Why it's important is to show where this right comes from and why it's so debated upon. 

There are a lot of restrictions that vary state to state. It isn't the wild west here like some tend to think. It is worth mentioning the arguments against it like a lot of people have problems with the amount of guns compared to people in the US. There is also the problem with what type of guns people own. Basically people say yeah we have a right to own guns but we shouldn't be decked out and more armed than some smaller countries.

Now as technology changes the arguments change. We wanted guns so we could rise up against corrupt government, but in this day and age the government  can take a drone over your house and drop a bomb so a gun isn't going to help you. It is still a nice right to have if someone is going to break into your home or someone who is trying to do you harm. I will say that significantly more gun violence occurs than guns used for self defense which is something to think about. There are also many studies that show that crime and gun control don't necessarily correlate. 

The reason I believe in It is I think about it on a smaller scale. I have three children. I have to protect them. Even if the chances someone would come in to harm us is very very low, I couldn't live with myself if I were to be helpless in that situation and great harm were to come to my family. A low chance doesn't mean it doesn't happen. We have 2 guns at my home and they are stashed away high in the closet out of reach of the children. I grew up in the southern states so I grew up handling guns my whole life and have spent a significant time hunting. This probably skews me toward no test but 🤷. 

I think maybe a lot more study on why people commit gun violence should be done and how to combat that rather than take away rights. There is always a fine line between more freedoms and more government security. 

Gun laws in America. Sorry I know all you did was talk about a test and I replied with a wall of text but this small thread is about guns and how America handles guns. Some people in here seem to be misinformed so I thought it was best to give some info and give my American opinion from my point of view. Of course there is much more to it than this but didn't want this to be ridiculousy long.

Item| US | Australia
---|---|----
Income| $120k | $120k
Fed Tax| $14,000 (11.7%) |$24,240 (20.2%)
State Tax| $3600 (3%)| --
**Total Paid in Tax**| **17,600 (14.7%)** | **$24,240 (20.2%)**
Retirement fund| +++ (401k not taxed) | none
Social Security (retirement)| ✔| ✔
Medical Expenses| $0 (company paid) | $0
PTO| 25 days| 20 days
Maternity Leave | 6 months | ?

In Australia, I would:

Pay $6,640 more in tax, have a higher cost of living, have the same health benefits I have at my company with less vacation time, and no additional funding for retirement (my tax rate includes social security but I also have a 401K allowing me to retire early).

I don't have anything special for my tax rate - i'm actually pretty high because I don't own a business and I don't have kids - so I get 0 tax right offs.",2019-06-20 00:17:24

uylpe6,"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.",2022-05-27 07:10:38

He's no comedian and he's definitely not perfect but he's taking more action to advance civilization and freedom than any of you neckbeard reddit geeks are, regardless of his mistakes or occasional hypocrisy. You guys need to chill the fuck out and stop taking petty stuff like this too seriously and adding more fuel to the fire of all the hate you people already have.

yizyx4,"Twitter in the late 00s was a completely different platform from 2022. The character limit came from the different ways you could send updates. One of them was via SMS which had a 160 character limit. They allocated 20 characters for commands (MESSAGE, D <USERNAME>, FOLLOW <USERNAME>, etc...) and the remaining 140 Characters were for the message. Perfect for notes, reminders, links, or random thoughts. 

This was one of the things that made it great for cross-platform communication. I had a couple of private accounts set up specifically to allow me to text reminders, links and other info that I wanted to access from my computer. You could also create a specific RSS feed for your favourite articles etc that would go straight into your RSS Reader. 

Then I started to notice the social aspects. In January 09 I created my actual account for interactions, finding a good number of interesting people to follow. Experts and intellectuals, comedians and regular folk. Info was short, fast, and usually linked to further sources.

But my favourite part was that it made me think. I'm *extremely* verbose (I know, I can see the shock in your eyes! 😁). So reducing what I wanted to say into 140 Characters was a personal challenge. I tried to avoid threads and even started a blog feed where I could add a more detailed post, knowing that it would get far fewer interactions than the tweet.

I could go on about all the reasons why I joined and enjoyed twitter but I'm sure you're bored by now. Let's see what the next one is like instead. 😉",2022-11-01 10:11:52

Anywho I think an attack over a church stating that they dont condone the messages of said speaker. To be frank most Christian churches are just multi-use auditoriums. I think people should stop shitting in those who hold religion there. The same you don't wanna hear my cool stories of when I'm successful.

There is already aftermarket components and software for Teslas that enables things like the $2000 acelleration boost and other built in, but paid for to activate functionality. 

While this certainly helps auto manufacturers streamline the building process by making all vehicles the same and activating the premium model features by software. 

They are simply creating a black market for people to profit off black market software and hardware to bypass and activate at a fraction of the cost. 

I’m not an expert, but I’d imagine they stop this pretty quick once everyone buys the $30,000 cheaper base model and pays $500 for a software and connector that activates all 30K worth of features.

Edit: also as someone who’s spent their entire career in software/IT. The last fucking thing I would trust is a remote software to control important functions of my vehicle. It doesn’t matter how good your developers and QA are. There is ALWAYS an issue.",2022-07-12 20:55:55

It may be worth considering, however, that similar to the warning you're giving me, you are supporting a group that deplatformed a political ""opponent"". (I recognize that they weren't necessarily at odds politically, or their political disagreements were not the crux of the issue). It is possible that you are playing into _their_ hands until deplatforming is the norm. Then what is stopping them from silencing opinions you agree with.

Of course, since Twitter is a company, and not a government entity, you could always move to a different platform, like many Trump supporters moved to Truth social (🙃).

klwjsn,"HR here. I have no problem with a candidate asking me what the salary range is for a position. In addition I also let them know what the range is to avoid wasting either of our times. 

Reason why many companies don’t put salaries in job postings is it gives them the ability to offer a wage based on the candidate’s skill set.

Example. I am at the level of an HR manager. Let’s say the position I’m applying to pays $50k. That is the top of the range for the company. I have all of the skills they’re seeking but I’m a bit light in the area of compensation. They see I am a good fit both culturally as well as my experience but it could take me a few months or a year to get up to speed with their compensation program. They are not going to offer me the top end of the range because I have room to grow. 

Another example is that companies mislabel job titles all the time. An HR director at one company has the same skills/experience as an HR Generalist at another. Huge difference in experience and also salary ranges. 

One more piece is location. I compete with companies in Boston. However, my area can’t offer Boston wages. Same position(s) different locations. So what do I do to woo applicants? Well, you won’t spend 2 hours of your life in traffic. You will have extra benefits at my company. You have a more robust retirement plan. 

Think about the whole package. Yes salary is important but that’s only one piece of the job offer.

What about gas money / bus fare?  I guess you just gotta walk 10 miles to work every day.  Screw food, water, and supplies too.

**BUT:** Despite my personal opinion, you're right and this is good discussion, and you're an idiot to think there's NOTHING you can't get away with if no bodily harm occurs. When in a private business, you can fired for fucking anything: *it just comes down to if it was lawfully/contractually and ethically executed.*

Pronouns? C'mon: it's like saying someone's name wrong when you know well how it's pronounced. This is an indicator you're an asshole, unless you just happen to have anterograde amnesia. 🙄

Time's changed; we have differing opinions, ever slightly, but this is not about if it's *just* or not. It's examining social norm(s) that have/are diffused enough to influence work environments--and what that says about the leadership's ideals, the individual's and the expected reality.

NO, thank you.

2) I want some people to return to the office because their cell and/or computer service at home sucks balls. Further, many people don't have the environment at home that allows for them to do their job effectively.

r2vple,"For those of you that agreed to coverage but never reviewed your actual policy, there are so many of you, do so. In my line of business ownership, there's almost nothing worse than having a customer come in only to find out they don't have rental ($20 a buck a year), or receiving a call in which the customer doesn't have towing on their policy around $60 a year. 

Whenever my policies come up for renewal during the 30 to 45 day renewal notification. I use that time to shop rates, coverages, limits of liability. This takes multiple calls sometimes. My auto policy used to renew every six months, now annually, another perk as far as I'm concerned that my old company doesn't offer. 

Back to your query. The reason why so many people overpay for their insurance and/or discover at the most inconvenient time (usually during a claim) that they're insurance doesn't cover them fully is because they don't know all the questions to ask. I'm a huge consumer advocate, well versed and I always discover things I didn't know, additional coverages offered etc. 

1) My current provider has a disappearing deductible, for homeowners policies, before that I'd never heard of such a thing for homeowners policies. 
2) They offer foundation coverage, great to have when your slab home sits on clay not bedrock.
3) Water backup and Sump coverage. Yeah some of us know about this one, but  usually it's capped at $5k maybe $10k, my insurer provides $50k without an increase to my premium.
4) Trip Interruption insurance, premium package, as part of my auto premium. 
5) Underground wires and pipe coverage $50k no increase to my premium for the additional amount of coverage once you've taken it. Not offered by my previous provider and when they 1st offered it to me the only wrote it for $10k of coverage. Sprinkler system had to be replaced, cost $13k, covered by insurance  and additional $550 to remove the tree.
6) TrafficTicket violation forgiveness so your premium will not go up from a ""small"" infraction. Haven't used it yet, and the coverage is part of a package.
7) Auto policy also has a disappearing deductible. 
8) Replacement Cost ""vs"" Actual Cash Value. I took the former.
9) All policies did not renew at the same time. 
10) I ""discovered"" private placed flood insurance. 
11) I only discovered the reducing homeowners premium and slab/foundation coverage because an independent agent was trying to sell me a policy to gain my business. 


And so on and so forth. It took several calls just to find the information out because no matter how many times I asked representatives to tell me everything you offer, they didn't. Each time I found out a new piece of information I also had to call my previous provider to find out if it's offered (it wasn't in most cases) and if so how much. 

Generally speaking I used to call every six months just to rate shop and compare coverages upon receiving my renewal notification (which always had a premium increase). 

Last year it took multiple calls on top of my usual checking of rates, coverages, and limits just because I couldn't understand and/or hear the representative because of call quality and/or background noise. 

Remember, you did ask 😉 😆. 

P.S. Also, think, every time they call me and ask if I want to come back, I ask, do you offer this, that or this? It makes the talk off real easy and FAST.",2021-11-27 01:28:24

My mainframes aren't online for security purposes. Those that want to work remotely but my business can't support it are welcome to leave as well.

The world has this issue. But only here is it LACED in our Constitution, structures, systems, policies, politics, and further embedded from one hate generation to the next. 

Honestly we need to burn and retry. Its numbing to be on this end. Trying hard to make the majority accept and literally not murder us for existing. Ivy leagues Uni, White House, if it is an important structure that started this country it was made on our ancestors backs and stained with their blood.  No pay, bowels and scraps to feed us and the pigs, no recognition, no honest freedom in the end. Most sadly look at reflections  of the Masters who raped our women in physical features, and we are tattooed with that sadistic piece of shits surname. 


If we were so dangerous and scary, and stupid as all the stereotypes say why in the fuck are we always silently waiting for something? Damn sure dont see us doing anything remotely on this level. We honestly would be mowed down before the thought could leave our lips. Its sucks here. Im so very happy I avoided and aborted bringing a life im supposed to love above all, to be hated just for exiting my latte colored womb.

We are STILL literally viewed and will always be 3/4 a person to them because of something biological and not of our doing or control. Nothing is ever equal, foot still on our throat as we walk gingerly trying to smile thru the bullshit we cant even leave. We have been shackled to this dump for generations. We have no clue where to even go back to. We cant even see who our people were pre 1850 if lucky. We have to use our last names (Masters surnames) to try and find which ancestors are ours on slave rolls … oh they categorized these rolls w/ boy/7y…. Girl…14/y…. If you were Samuel Jackson level from Django, they might have taken the effort to list your first name.

I wonder where this assasinated King’s 🤴🏾 people came from? Which part of this country’s entire beginning to wealth were they responsible for?? All that pain, trauma, genocide to work and make better for us to just get killed in a new age kind of way. Its beyond not fair. He deserves more than another hashtag. 

At 43 I feel the PTSD. Im aging into rage and bitter as I continue to ingest this stench. Now atheist to avoid the same smokeshow that was crafted to make Indigenous and Blacks docile to all abuse by their Master. Throw fake ass Christianity back in the fields. No God i want in my corner allows this TRAUMA to go on, without beaming down and stopping it. Spirit Man has no seat at my table. Persona non grata.

Allies don’t need to prove their knowledge to us, go preach wokeness to your own.  That helps more than you know, most racist lack education and knowledge, they are mocking their environment full of stereotypes and anecdotes. They will listen to you vs diminishing our words and dna level knowledge. 

Seriously this shit is getting old. We can’t, have not, nor will we ever get over it. That is akin to taking a piss on the unknown/unmarked graves of our people who endured the worst of this struggle.

uq88uz,"> laws are now written to be racially equal


That means nothing. In the modern day still we have a thing called de facto discrimination. Despite abolishing de jure discrimination, the actual carrying out of law is not equal. That’s why we have unequal incarceration rates (even if adjusted for “people of color committing more crime”. although there’s bias in the rate of convictions and the resources allotted to pursuing non-white criminals as opposed to white ones which also leads to unbalanced incarceration rates), we have people of color being less likely to be promoted and having lower salaries despite equal qualifications (there’s lots of studies on these topics), etc. The fact that there’s enough racist individuals in the system to cause these outcomes should tell you something about the scale of it

And on top of that there’s the effects of racism today that still exist because of de jure racism in the past. A good example: school districts that are funded mostly by property taxes. Because of segregation, redlining, etc any people of color were unable to build enough wealth to leave low resource subdivisions so they went to low resource schools with low quality education leading poorer career outcomes and the cycle continues. that’s somewhat of an oversimplification but you get the point. But then people ignore all of that and blame poor outcomes on lack of individual effort and “victim mentality”. Not to say that those aren’t important factors (and that there’s an element of lacking a culture of success that contributes to that), but I think there’s a lot of “black people just don’t work hard” kind of racism in the modern day because people don’t try to understand how social determinants affect outcomes 


> the vast majority of people of people are tired of hearing everything get twisted as racial issues when they’re not 

This argument never made any sense to me because you’re generalizing how you feel and people around you feel to the general public. Doesn’t the fact that people incessantly talk about it mean that many of us still want to hear the narrative and talk about it? Also I know how medical deaths get reported. That’s a false equivalency and also just not true because on a death certificate COVID would not be listed as cause of death in that scenario. I think some of the things that people blame racism on can be more complex than just racism as the primary driving factor. But that kind of stuff can fall more into the opinion/speculation category and it’s more of a case by case thing so I have no comment. I’m your example of “getting into a tussle” I think that in some cases you’re right that people may assume racism is a factor when it’s not. But I think you’re severely overestimating how much crime gets sensationalized. White people murder black people every day and it doesn’t go on the news and people don’t make assumptions. And many of the cases that get sensationalized of a white person murdering a black man actually do have a racial bias component despite people trying to refute that (case in point the recent Buffalo shooting). 


The anecdote about Arkansas with the YouTuber. I’m sure there’s plenty of places where the racism is exaggerated. But anecdotal evidence isn’t objective data. People have done actual research on this. Like two years ago I saw a video of a bunch of kids at a predominantly white high school huddle around to take a photo around a bunch of brown blowup dolls being hung from the ceiling in a way that was obviously supposed to mimic a lynching. This was a high school in the suburbs for fuck’s sake. 

> is is really as big of a problem as people make it out to be?


This is a question that is difficult to answer because It’s hard to quantify what you believe the scale of racism is today. i personally think you’re minimizing it here, especially if you don’t think there’s racism on a systems level. Because there definitely is. But usually I agree to disagree with people on that point or they get tired of arguing with me which is perfectly okay lmao

The Military itself is some 70+% ""Right""(when you factor in that most aren't actually Conservative but Libertarian) So POTUS saying you don't need AR17s and AK49s to fight the government, you need tanks and fighter jets is a non factor when they are without Operators. 

The Militia is the ones you are trying so hard to disarm and disparage.... Don't reckon they are standing by your side either. They are staunch Constitutionalists.

As one commenter above pointed out the ""Right"" lives in 80% of the rural areas of this Country. So you can't just wall them off as he suggested to starve them. They already live off the land and you can't go to them without making yourself seen from far off... Could easily siege the large cities that most of the ""Left"" hail from though 🤷🏼‍♂️. 

The ""Right"" owns probably 75-85% of the Countries firearms... I'd venture a guess that thier ammo stockpile is even higher...they practice and  train, and are proficient in not only self-defense but military TTPs as most are Prior Service military members and retirees. They know how to train and lead people to fight. 

Oh and I should point out for historical purposes that it was Republicans.... specifically ""Radical Republicans"" who fought the hardest against democratic slave owners to end slavery, ensure the suffering of African Americans didn't continue and that the Confederate States didn't fall back into the power of Prior Confederate Officers in the Wade-Davis Bill (Vetoed by Abe). 
(Feel free to fact check)

Sooooo Let's just agree to disagree, not fight it out on the streets. Y'all don't really want that smoke. 

Unless you are Advocating for some sort of socialist or communist State ... To that I say .... ""Hope you got some LVL IV plates... Comrade""",2023-03-18 18:40:50

i5ynyr,"One of the only times I’ve taken Uber Pool I was on vacation in Washington DC during the Fourth of July.  My wife and I decided to try it because it was cheaper, the driver picked us up and the other passenger was already there.  So the Uber map algorithm had calculated that it was more efficient to drop us off first, even though the other passenger was there first.  

The issue was, this woman was going to the airport and decided to use Uber Pool and started berating our driver for dropping us off first, saying she was gonna miss her flight.  The driver tried to explain the app predetermines the route and this woman was just not having it, like full on swearing at him.  

So maybe leave a little earlier or don’t use Uber Pool when you need  to be to the airport. 🤷🏻‍♂️",2020-08-08 17:21:04

zq7mtt,"Hmmm, but — people living under slavery in the US didn’t get 3/5 of a vote. They just counted as 3/5 of a person for the population count, to give the white landowners additional seats in congress. 

So I guess what should happen is that Twitter blue folks can just claim power over some of us non-blue people (using whatever fucked up, made up ideology they need to create to justify it), and vote essentially in our name as well as theirs, but their “extra” votes just count for 3/5. We still don’t get any say.

qwba98,"Librarians are tripping over themselves to help ppl these days. I don’t think many ppl use the library anymore, bc when I used my library’s feedback tool once, I got like 3 emails from librarians all asking what materials I’d like to see in the library and what other books I’d want to check out if they were made available, etc. This is at a public library system serving a major city of millions. I bet they all wrote about my feedback in their monthly reports & I influenced purchasing decisions for weeks to come 😄 “This book has been requested by 75% of surveyed patrons!”",2021-11-18 04:37:58

qwba98,"I’ve always been an avid reader so by the time I was 30 I’d read literally thousands of books. Discussing books with my best friend who is the daughter of a librarian I mentioned I really wanted to get my daughter (7 or so at the time) a copy of one of my favorites from that age. All I could clearly remember was the girl was native and was abandoned on an island and had to figure out how to survive on her own. I was relatively sure it was an award winner but which one I couldn’t have guessed.  “Oh, I remember that one. The Island of the Blue Dolphins.”  And it was. And it’s still a darn good read. 

That book is likely part of the reason I’ve always been so drawn to the “leave all the annoying people and go be a hermit” lifestyle. Sure it’s hard as hell, but at least there aren’t any annoying people around. 😂",2021-11-18 05:55:50

jz7zt3,"That’s because the concept of ‘breast is best’ was meant as an educational tool - teaching young women about breastfeeding in prenatal classes and the like.
But unfortunately, it’s the stupid people who have corrupted it into a horrible judgement against parents who use formula - it’s like, we all KNOW breast is best. We know. And since we all know that, the smart thing to do is assume every woman who uses formula has been through the same education as the rest of us, and is using formula and not the breast for a darn good reason which is no one else’s business besides her and her doctor. 

But instead of just assuming all those formula using women are using it for a reason, judgemental jerks just have to bully women and do their best to make them miserable.

So now we have to dumb the education down for the lowest common denominator (the horrible bullies), and explain to them - slowly - that FED is best. A fed baby is healthier than a starving one because the breast isn’t available for any number of reasons that aren’t anyone else’s business. 

Stupid bullies ruining it for everyone else! 😞",2020-11-23 16:15:05

I was also super lucky to have good insurance and access to unlimited lactation consultation visits. Otherwise, I don't think I would have made it with breastfeeding.

iqgja6,"Me too, this election is the last straw but even if Biden wins I’m considering it.

Why did people emigrate to America and why do people all over the world move to new countries? For a better life for themselves and their future families. 

If I have to be totally honest I don’t see staying in America as what’s best for myself, my family, and any future generations that come after. The whole culture and politics is toxic. The US is behind in just about every metric you could think of and I hardly think this a good country to raise a child in. And I don’t see it improving rapidly enough and at the level quick enough to make a real difference. Not to seem like an edgy teen but as a student of history I don’t see how you can’t call the U.S. a failed state/a nation in precipitous decline at the very least.

I lived in Europe for 6 months in 2018 and spend every day since fantasizing about how to move back. And now I get ads almost daily about moving to Canada. As if America is now a place where ads are placed inviting you to move out of the country.

Edit: I won’t compare countries by their cities but rather their rural areas. After I graduated from school I drove around Germany and let me compare rural Germany to the rural US. Comparison is a bad word because they can’t even be fairly compared. One is modern, full of good roads, wind turbines, and educated and often bilingual people. Vibrant and friendly, beautiful and full of life. The other is nothing of the sort.

On the other hand, I went to visit some friends at UF in college and me and my friends drove home to Miami from Gainesville on US 27 through rural Florida. It was like a third world country (Ik that’s a problematic term but idk how else to describe it). Life, infrastructure, and culture were frozen as they were in 1960 except over those past 60 years now it’s been allowed to crumble and fester like a wound. The roads: shit. The other infrastructure like power and internet: shit. Race relations: the same place they were 60 years ago. Education: where? And these people would resent you being bilingual let alone welcome it as part of standard public education. My experience in rural America really opened up my eyes to what a sorry state this country was in.

Also if you want to compare cities compare any large American airport to an airport in a city in Europe or Asia, or the subway systems. The European subway systems and airports totally blew me away. I never realized they could be so modern instead of stuck in the state they were in 1970. Even a mid size European city like Milan has a subway system that puts anything we have in America to shame. Some cities aren’t particularly modern like Paris, Madrid, or Rome but still leaps and bounds ahead of NYC. I had a job interview in NY and had to call them from Yankee Stadium because the tunnel flooded or something and now trains couldn’t get into Manhattan. When I called and told them they said “Yeah, we saw on the news and figured you couldn’t make it.” Meanwhile in London, trains run promptly like every 3 minutes with screens notifying you when the next will arrive. 🤷🏼‍♂️",2020-09-11 05:37:00

I don't want to believe that the Secret Service was/is part of a conspiracy to overthrow the government, but it's looking that way isn't it?

Last time I had to choose between ramen and rent I had the cheapest phone and plan I could get and definitely wasn't posting shit on Twitter with my hair done and a stylist shirt... Because I didn't own any of that when I couldn't feed myself. 

Self-service haircuts, Hanes white t-shirts purchase at a discount store and pants that usually had holes somewhere... Plus rent, Plus very cheap food (until I started working in food service so I didn't have to worry about purchasing food as badly) and tuition. That last part is why I no longer have to make those choices.

It is harder to make it today than for dinner previous generations, yes, but it sure as hell isn't as hard for us as it was for the folks who lived through the depression, WW1, WW2.

I believe this message is true for lots of struggling families in America, just have a hard time believing the original Twitter poster is one of them.

While ""social media influencers"" try to be the modern day gate keepers with promotional tweets/post... smart companies know that smart people like you... aren't going to buy a Nokia just because Kim Kardashian drops an Instagram post about it at 3 am.

Precisely, neither the business owner nor the server are making money as opposed to just the server not making money when you don’t tip while the employer earns the same amount. You’re so close to a rational thought it’s insane lmao. 

> Also I never said sweatshops are a good thing. If you think that is what I was trying to bring across, idk man, nice dunning kruger effect you've got going on there.

You’re saying that only my logic would dictate that buying from sweatshops is bad, and you’re apparently disagreeing. That’s how you explained it. If that’s not the point you were trying to make maybe be better at explaining your points? Lmao

3. Is scenario 1., except she loses her baby to the state, which is also fine, because she's a terrible person. Bonus double-shun for being both a slut and a failure of a mother.  

4. Terrified by 1-3, teenage girl is too terrified to have premarital sex, waits until marriage, and has lots of babies, preferably without actually enjoying the sex, but they'll let that one slide as long as she keeps quiet about it. She's a good girl.

We discovered there were no chairs in the rooms, in the computer cubbies, and we're banned from sitting in the nurses station. The reason? HR had contracted a company that coached on HCAHPS scores (healthcare surveys), and they said nurses looked ""busier"" when they were standing. Yes, they really expected us to stand for 14 hrs straight. We also were to be written up if we sat together at the nurses station, bc it looked like we weren't busy. The nurses station was now for doctors only. Apparently doctors still looked busy when they sat 🙄 Needless to say, this didn't last long, but it was real insight to me as a baby nurse as to how out of touch the upper management was regarding what nurses do and need in the work place.",2021-10-03 23:58:39

\*I gotta hijack top comment to warn everyone here about weath inequality*\*

&#x200B;

Inequality in general is so much worse than most people realize and there's plenty of information that proves it. So, where to start?

[The ultra-rich are hoarding as much as $32 trillion ($32,000,000,000,000) in offshore accounts to avoid taxes.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth-idUSBRE86L03U20120722) As a way to understand just how much 32 trillion is, let's use time as an example. One million seconds is 12 days, and one billion seconds is 31.7 years. That's already a massive difference between a million and a billion, but how much is 32 trillion seconds? It's over a million years.

Most people know that wealth inequality is a huge issue, but they don't understand just how bad it is. Here's an example: **If  you had a job that paid you $2,000 an hour, and you worked full time (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all  of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much money as Jeff Bezos.**

I've been researching this issue for years because I was shocked at just how bad it really is, and I've put together some information to help illustrate it.

We had an insurance claim on our house and I deposited the check so I could pay the contractors. Triggered something in their system and caused an audit of our accounts.

>[We] had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying?

>We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.

>Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting “real people affected by taxes.”

Republican ""Southern Strategy"":

>Republican Party electoral strategy to increase political support among white voters by appealing to racism against African Americans.[1][2][3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy

Lyndon Johnson criticizing it in 1960:

>If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1988/11/13/what-a-real-president-was-like/d483c1be-d0da-43b7-bde6-04e10106ff6c/

Lee Atwater, Ronald Reagan adviser, Republican National Committee chairman, ""the most effective Republican operative in the south for about a decade until he joined Reagan in the White House, most of it during his 20s,"" helped create Republican ""Southern Strategy"" and Fox News with Roger Ailes:

>You start out in 1954 by saying, “Ni\*\*er, ni\*\*er, ni\*\*er.” By 1968 you can’t say “ni\*\*er”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Ni\*\*er, ni\*\*er.”

> **Exit polls done after 2016 show that the single characteristic that made someone most likely to vote for trump over Clinton is racial resentment.** https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/05/26/these-9-simple-charts-show-how-donald-trumps-supporters-differ-from-hillary-clintons/ If you gathered all of the poor working class white voters in America and all of the ""racially resentful"" voters (I'll just call them racists, because that's what they are), you'd find that a higher percentage of the racists voted for trump than the poor people.
> 
> But if you had read every New York Times fluff piece about trump voters in rural diners, you would never believe that fact. Somehow, the news story ""rural and small-town white working class people were more likely to vote Republican in 2016 than they were in previous elections"" turned into ""every white working class person in America adores trump"".
> 
> I figured out that the news media was handling trump with kid gloves when I read multiple news stories in early 2016 about his ""charisma"" and his ability to ""tell it like it is"" at his rallies, and then I decided to actually watch a rally. I had to quit after 20 minutes, because he lacked any form of charisma, and his speech was essentially the script of a primetime Fox News show as read by a senile grandpa who lost his reading glasses. He had ZERO appeal to anybody who wasn't already deep in a far right echo chamber, like Fox News or online alt-right forums.
> 
> I can somewhat sympathize with the idea that trump attracted voters who feel like they're in ""flyover country"" and that the modern world has passed them by, because if you smash your forehead with a 2×4 and then immediately listen to a trump rally, you can sort of claim that trump is addressing those concerns. But then if you listen to the other 90% of his speech, you find that he has the exact same delusions about modern America as a millionaire who lives in a gated retirement community in Florida and hasn't worked since the Reagan administration. To anybody who watches one of his rallies with no prior expectations, it seems like a prank, because it's blindingly obvious that trump is a narcissistic, sociopathic lifelong con man who was born with a silver spoon in his asshole and never did an honest day's work in his miserable life. But I suppose that's where the racial resentment comes in, because I have no other explanation for how a self-respecting 55 year old factory worker from the Midwest could fail to see through trump's obvious grift.

So your point, whatever that was though my guess is too divide people rather than being them together, is lost on the actual science at at hand. 

Because the science is all that matters, and if people actually embraced it into their actions (unlike Bleach/Sunlight Trump, or staunch Democrat allies Biden/Harris when going against Trump), then we'd probably be in front of this thing and not behind it. 

Your initial post just finger pointed back at the OP, I replied to you in the same vein.

So there is no valid point, just finger pointing.

Remember the truck attack in France??  Also blaming everyone involved with the 2A or NRA is the same as being sexist or racist your singling out an entire group based on a few crazy fucks that no law abiding citizen will defend the actions of. Also do your history research on what happens when the government takes your firearms does mao or hitler ring a bell?? 100s of millions of people first disarmed then massacred. Without the second amendment you wouldn’t even have the right to talk about anything or have any individualism or any rights at all you will be slaves to the people you give your rights up to period. I’ll re iterate shit like this dumb ass shooting innocent people is criminal just like shooting into the air is negligent and criminal. And should be punished to the fullest degree of law. Maybe bring back public hangings and punishments. People tend to not fuck around and fight out when they see what will happen when they do.Look at other countries like Syria they have public whippings but you can also walk into any house the occupants will cook you food for multiple days if I remember correctly can you just walk into a randoms house and sit down for dinner😂 no but that shows how cultures are so drastically different maybe if everyone would stop trying to divide we could come together and prosper.",2023-04-29 22:16:57

However the sold stocks were often bought/borrowed by other funds doing the same thing. 

So when WSB began buying the stocks up, the price began rising. Thus, there's a chain of borrowers who expected to make profits buying the stock back at cheap prices before paying what they owe to a chain of lenders who now want their better priced stock back.

I.E. The greed, theft, envy committed by the poor against ‘Wealthy’ persons or their estate is on the fault of the ‘Wealthy Person’. 
This is why it’s important that the super-rich devote a portion of their wealth back into the community/state that they live in, had lived in, or the poorer districts of your society. If they don’t then when the poor inevitably  steal, attack, or drag the rich person out of their home it was the responsibility of the Wealthy Person to prevent that before it happened, legally, according to the Roman Empire👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

It’s logical, reasonable, and sound👏🏻

Also, CPS, in some areas, will just place the child through a private Christian foster agency with another, possibly even more batshit crazy Christian family.

A kid died through the agency I was placed through in 2008, they shut down the agency in only one state - it was reopened under another name and still operates in two states in the Midwest to this day.

I was approached by a much older man at that age in my private primary school uniform where I had fallen a bit behind on a school walk to church and back. 

Most of us had stories like that and none of us had told our parents because we hadn't been taught at that age about that sort of thing yet. It made us ashamed and feel wrong for 'making' men treat us this way. That shame led to other bad decisions as well. 

I understand it must suck so much knowing that this type of evil is around, but statistically, the odds aren't good that she will never be a victim of sexual harrassment etc in some form.  I understand you won't want to look at your sweet little one and want to burden her too soon but again, I urge you to have the hard convos.

[Here's a quick history of clown world and honkler/honk honk] (https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/clown-pepe-honk-honk-clown-world) Anecdotally, I saw the rise and fall of those subs and that rhetoric. I also am friends with the brother of the guy who created Pepe, and watching his art get hijacked for hate was very difficult. I find myself overly suspicious with certain, more rare dog whistles.

[Here's the time I caught the guy attacking Reich, btw.](https://i.imgur.com/xGSGpcq.jpg) The guy who went on to say honk honk, because how dare I defend Robert Reich, right? I also saw him use racism in /r/Portland (you know, where the hate group Proud Boys is clashing with Anti-fascists). 

Here's another example. Just this week I found a guy defending Tucker Carlson in a thread that was providing lots of examples on why Ticket Carlson is a white supremacist because Tucker Carlson was saying President Zelensky was creating a war on Christianity. [It was how the user attacked me that made me suspicious of his motive.](https://i.imgur.com/ETytUI0.jpg)

Well, going into his post history (I have no clue why my Reddit app shows removed/deleted comments sometimes) [I found this.](https://i.imgur.com/xzz6iz4.jpg) ""Baker Honks"" from a guy offended that I'm teaching people about race bait videos. It was obvious to me, and I wanted to confirm that suspicion, so I spent 5 seconds in his public history and saw that. 

Baker = [QAnon people call themselves this](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/qanon) and QAnon is full of antisemitic culture. Baking can also be used in reference to the gas chambers of the Holocaust being ovens. 

Either way, coupled with ""honk."" That confirmed my suspicion. 

Again, context is everything. Nazis live to hide behind plausible deniability.

* Just like how the 🤡 emoji was mostly used by hate-types a few years ago, it's now more widely used by non-hate
* Just like ø is being used in Antisemitic circles, Scandinavian languages use it

Lol, sure. They’re thoughts and ideals in the same way the KKK was. Now, I would be willing to argue Antifa isn’t a traditional organization. It’s more of a collective tbh. 

MAGA is the belief that the USA has fallen short of its ideals. The USA has gotten off track economically and culturally in recent years because of the trends of “race over competency”, “let’s ship our jobs overseas so billion dollar cooperations can make even more money”, and “import a lot of low skilled workers to compete against our own low skilled workers for jobs which drive wages down”. MAGA wants to return to a time of economic prosperity and cultural equality where we are united through patriotism regardless of race or creed. MAGA is an agenda. 

Also, bear in mind these MAGA related “extremists and terrorists” didn’t start popping up until after BLM and Antifa began their own extremism and terrorism. It’s almost as though cowboys for trump are a reaction to the left’s actions. 🤔

Possibly, but most are only being charged with trespassing. As for the Trumps, it’s funny how you’re so angry about something he didn’t do but you’re not angry about the democrats like Maxine Waters doing the same and worse. Also, hit me up in 4 years and let me know if you’re doing better. I hope Biden’s admin is able to be successful, but I highly doubt it considering his own party is trying to take the nuke codes away from him. 

See, I differentiate liberals and “progressives”. Liberals don’t advocate for hate speech and silencing people who disagree with them. They’re open to debate, and they’re generally good people. Progressives... not so much. 

It’s sad to see you’ve listened to the propaganda to the point where you can’t even see the other side as anything more than extremists. Personally, I just want to be left alone. I just want to work, come home, watch a little tc, spend time with my family, and do my own thing. I can’t because everytime I turn the tv on I see some puffed up mouth piece lying about something which those too lazy to do their own due diligence swallow while because it fits their confirmation bias. 

This whole screed about veggies and red meat is mental. Why not let people eat what they want? I’m more than happy to let people have marijuana even though I don’t use it, so why is it you have a problem with people eating red meat? 

If you want good clean energy, why can’t we use nuclear reactors? Windmills are unreliable and solar is lacking currently because battery technology just isn’t there yet. 

You’re forgetting that this once in a century blizzard in Texas isn’t the norm there. Are you really that upset that Cruz went on vacation ahead of the blizzard? It’s not like he knew there was going to be a catastrophic blizzard in Texas of all places. This is just as ridiculous as people getting passed off at obama because of how often he went golfing. 

Speaking of fundraising and the capitol riots, should our current Vice President be impeached for literally promoting and providing monetary aid for people who terrorized our cities over the summer or are you just selectively outraged over republicans calling for a protest that went bad?",2021-02-28 19:37:25

lbpkry,"> The EU's vaccine rollout is widely criticised as a failure so I don't know why you're comparing the US to them

It's called supporting evidence, it's a rhetorical technique to persuade you to believe me when I say that claiming non-US UHC systems outperformed the US in the pandemic is highly sensitive to exactly what metric you care about.

> Why not compare it to the UK or Israel?

Because I'm not cherry picking top outliers?  Yes, Israel is doing very well with vaccine rollout.  The US could learn from their rollout, especially the state of Virginia.  The UK is doing very well on testing.

But the US is still well ahead of the pack in testing, which is why this:

>  Both countries who have vaccinated more people than the US, handled testing better than the US and conduct regular RNA testing of COVID samples from testing to test the spread of variants. That's all done publicly by those countries, the CDC tried to pass off massive amounts of their testing capabilities to private companies and the result is massively inadequate RNA sequencing and testing capacity.

...is a pretty dishonest thing to say.  Also, do you not remember early on in the pandemic when the CDC and FDA worked together to monopolize testing and people literally had to *break the law* to test people for covid?  weird that you forgot about that.

> Me having the security to know i'm not just gonna be left to die because I can't afford heart surgery is a massive public good, you're acting like the US is the only country on planet Earth.

I don't know what point you think you're trying to make, but *your hypothetical peace of mind* is not a public good.

> Look at the countries with the highest vaccination rates and list the countries that are handling it privately.

??? The US has the second highest per-cap vaccination rate, and the highest absolute vaccination rate, and our vaccine rollout is best described as a public private partnership, and will 🤞 probably be the first country to herd immunity through vaccination.",2021-02-04 16:21:19

And it doesn't work when you're comparing a shit response that everyone makes fun of to a shit response that everyone makes fun of. Both are shit, you're comparing your cake to a pile of shit while saying ""Well it doesn't taste that bad...""



>...is a pretty dishonest thing to say


Just ignoring all of it because it's a fact?


> Also, do you not remember early on in the pandemic when the CDC and FDA worked together to monopolize testing and people literally had to break the law to test people for covid? weird that you forgot about that.


Except it wasn't the CDC and FDA carrying out testing, it was ""muh private enterprise"" that you keep championing.


>I don't know what point you think you're trying to make, but your hypothetical peace of mind is not a public good.

A majority of people would disagree with you. Go to a country with Public Healthcare and ask if it's a public good.


>??? The US has the second highest per-cap vaccination rate,


[If by second highest you mean third then sure. It's totally the ""second highest""](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations).


Wanna compare spending between those countries on healthcare? Cause it's not impressive to be third when you're spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as countries handling the pandemic vastly better than you.


>and the highest absolute vaccination rate

Not really relevant when per capita statistics are the only thing relevant in a pandemic.

>and our vaccine rollout is best described as a public private partnership,

And yet slower than other countries who are vaccinating more people per capita per day, despite the fact that the distribution is largely being handled by the Government with only the end vaccine administration being privately handled. 



>and will 🤞 probably be the first country to herd immunity through vaccination.

Despite not having the highest vaccination rate per capita and already lagging behind other countries? Whatever you say man lol


All while you're bragging about the US's ""amazing"" rollout, there were almost 4000 people who died in the US yesterday alone from Covid-19. A slightly better than the EU's rollout isn't impressive when you've fucked every single other aspect of the pandemic handling and are leading the world in Covid deaths.",2021-02-04 16:29:39

y98f3c,"I've become pretty liberal over the past decade or so and when I saw the title, I rolled my eyes and thought that stuff like this is why others deride any sort of potentially helpful policy as a ""nanny state"". I couldn't get the video to load for a while and just figured it was an over-reaction. Oh boy, usually I'm not **THAT** incorrect but damn, I was thinking out of my ass. Who the fuck does this to children? It suddenly made me think of a video meme of some pink girl saying ""Nope! Nope! Go to jail!"" as she cuffs someone.

Not everyone likes to be scared. I detest jump scares, they feel more like a startle than a scare and many things can startle someone. But when I know that the danger is controlled or non-existent, then getting to indulge a bit in a primal instinct can be fun. Those kids were screaming for their lives it sounded like.

I had something *somewhat* related when I was between eight and ten years old. Haunted hayride or something but horse-drawn hay thingy, it was dark, near Halloween, and nothing spooky had happened yet. Their opening hand was pretty awesome; giant, burly dude basically steps off a branch in the tree right above us with a fake chainsaw. It roared to life, even sputtered and belched dark fumes. I don't remember what happened next, maybe my brain filed it under ""fuck this, I'm out"" cause that's exactly what rest of me did. According to my parents, in one smooth motion I turned while standing up and leapt out the cart. Fight or Flight wisely decided on Flight. My father manager to twist around and catch me. Like, I enjoyed the experience, the memory of someone dropping out a tree onto our cart with a roaring, fake chainsaw was what's scientifically known as ""totally fucking sweet"". Just instincts I guess, no thought, only flight. 

I love Halloween. 🍫👺🍬",2022-10-21 10:58:53

Agreed. Though, I don't think the two are mutually exclusive. Yes they are worried about the dilution of Christmas, but they also don't like shift away from Christianity as the societal norm. Both are presented with the same ""decline"" narrative. Many accept Jews especially given the importance of Judaism to Christianity but still expect them to play second fiddle. 

I grew up around evangelicals, I've seen this mentality in dinner table  conversations throughout my life. My dad was a gospel singer. I used to go to church camp every year when I was younger. I was very much immersed in the evangelical community. 

>Easter is the far more important day on the Christian calendar. It may sound funny, but Jesus's birth is no where close to being as important as His death.

I'm basically the one who'd have waited to be the Last (because the scheme was obvious) honestly. To tell them ""Thank you but fuck you"".

Once, i got this kind of ridiculous set up, where we were supposed to have individual interview, but when we all came to the office, surpriiise, no interview at all. Instead, the bitch put all of us in a room, and gave us papers with technical questions about the job.
One of the girl was like ""i dont understand, it was not supposed to be like this, etc"" so i took the lead and said ""she is watching us, and looking to see Who takes the lead, Who is needy, Who more of an individualist etc"", so I kept Reading every question out loid and giving the answers to everyone and made sûre everybody was Having an amazing time, we were loud, laughing... and when i was done, i left.

p8wsx5,"Not a true story. Not a real scenario. 

I’d do the same thing. If you’d gotten the job (and looked like someone who’d kiss ass and play their games) you’d be met almost instantly (say within 10-11 minutes) and be given a job based on the following interview. 

My favorite excuses are “we’re interviewing a lot more/of people for this/these position(s) so expect to hear from a call back soon or don’t hesitate to call (us) if you don’t hear anything!” And after going through almost a week to get a interview you wait to hear back a week (after getting no actual call back info) to hear my all time favorite:

“We thank you for your interest/consideration in a position at/with *X* - we have decided to go forward with other candidates in the hiring/interview process at this time but do not hesitate to apply in the future. Thank you for your time.” 

Especially when I know my resume fits *your* somewhat asinine fucking base job requirements (they’re the same at any job if it’s a starting position), the interviewer liked me and you said over the phone that you had almost no other candidates or that you were subconsciously looking for a overachiever with a college degree. Which I’m not. 

Any place that has done this to me - I don’t or won’t apply to you again because I automatically know the end result. I did this as a test with a company about 2 months ago. This time they didn’t even bother calling me back. Don’t have me wait a week and a half about a $20 starting position you had no intention of hiring me for after I waited almost a week for the initial interview because Monday morning bright and early somehow didn’t fit *your* schedule. 🖕🏻",2021-08-22 13:54:18

p4e6jk,"This system was developed in the 1960s after millions of WW2 vets attended college in the 1950s. Saddled with no debt because their educations were FREE due to the GI BILL, they were able to earn good salaries and buy what they needed without accumulating overburdensome personal debt. Newspaper, TV, magazine & radio ADVERTISING led to the ""keeping up with the Joneses"" mentality. CONSUMERISM was born 💰 This led to the issuance of credit by the banks to consumers, & the credit card culture that exists so banks can generate income from service fees and high interest rates. Today, one man's debt is another man's credit, so today people purchase debt. It's called capitalism and it benefits the banks, corporations, Wall Street & the stock market, ie, those who now control our government, including all REPUBLICANS & corporate Democrats by buying them off to write legislation that is beneficial to them. This is why BIG OIL receives govt subsidies for example. This is known as corporate WELFARE. The only way out of this mess is to align yourself with social progressives.

p4e6jk,"People confuse credit score with financial health. They can correlate but don't necessarily. Credit score is only how much more appealing you are to lending institutions based on how much you earn, how much you borrow, how quickly you pay off, etc. You'll have a better credit score by keeping accounts open and paying a little more than minimum payments but never closing the account. On the other hand, for financial health, I would recommend the *waterfall method* where you pay off as much as you can and close accounts starting with highest interest. 

You actually get more points for higher interest rates, but not as much as volume. The point is, just to reiterate, it's completely for the benefit of the institutions. If you realize that then maybe you can use credit to your advantage but then it becomes a game of points and rebates... Like couponing. I do it for free airfare. 🤷‍♂️ 

Edit: to be clear... I make large purchases on an airliner branded card which gives me points. My interest is pretty low but it doesn't matter because I literally make payments as soon as the purchases are on the card.",2021-08-15 00:20:05

He also told me and my wife to open new credit cards immediately, so we had exactly two credit cards each. My score increased from 670 to 740 within a year, which allowed me to buy a house and that mortgage pushed me up to 790 where it remains today. 🤷‍♂️",2021-08-14 21:13:59

Getting your GED two weeks before the election should not be a barrier... It only is for the person here because Boebert is a stupid asshat... which I get but that's not reasonable grounds. There could be a really decent and intelligent person that just didn't finish high school. Right? So that's shitty. 

The husband thing is so ridiculous I don't need to comment on that lol she can have that one for sure.  Or can she... Because should we bar people from running for office due to something their significant other did? Especially when it was back when Boebert was apparently 17? Again, I hate her... But these have to be barriers for all or none, right? Pelosi's husband is doing all kinds of sketch and clearly illegal shit but she's still there. Just saying. But also fuck Borbert's and Pelosi's husbands. 

Her being arrested several times also could mean a lot of things if it was someone different. Redemption is real. Very real.

Now, do I think she should have been elected?? FUUUUUUUCK NO.

Just saying these are kind of silly reasons. The husband one is teetering. But the other two aren't. Now is Boebert clearly just a trash person? Yeah. How did she get elected? By trash people. 🤷🏿‍♂️",2022-08-02 23:11:32

rvdlj7,"I don’t know if the story is true or we should use it as a hypothetical, ether way. 🤷‍♂️

There’s definitely a distinction here between intending to spread a disease and having a disease and it spreading incidentally. It doesn’t sound like there was any intent to spread the disease. Obviously we don’t have much detail. 

Early on I was aware of some gentleman who caught Covid from a bartender working at a golf course, she had tested positive but opted to go to work for whatever reason (she needed the money or just because). One of those men was hospitalized but didn’t die. Should she pay for his hospital bills as well or go to jail? 

I think my point here is we need some sort of test for unintentionally spreading Covid when you know your Covid pos to determine criminal liability. What if you spread it within your household? Do we need to forcible detain people proactively? 

You could probably file a civil case. I’m skeptical of aggressively criminally prosecuting people. It also incentivizes people not get tested so they would have plausible deniability if we are talking about a law that only applies to Covid.

I was at the skatepark one time and there was this dude I had never seen there shredding the bowl. At first glance, I see he blatantly has a swastika on his chest. 

I'm a chill guy. I almost never resort to violence or even violent altercation. But I'm sitting here, at a skatepark in black-as-fuck ATL, and I'm ready to beat the shit out of this guy. Absolutely ready. Don't care who has my back, it's me and him and that's all I want in this moment.

I skate directly towards him, looking him right in the fucking eye. Kick my board to the side and get right up at him, and that's when I see it. An unfortunately faintly-drawn X through the swastika, and the words surrounding it in small letters: ""fight Nazis on sight.""

I saw it, laughed, told the guy my mistake, and he said something along the lines of ""hey, no sweat at all, you literally were the message"". I told him he should get the X painted red just to avoid any future misunderstandings 😂",2022-06-08 01:28:30

NO IT ISN'T. You sign their TOS making them the final decision on your freedom of speech within their digital domain. 

You also allow them to use any and all that you post as they see fit (within the terms of service specifically but ""not limited to."")  This may have changed but I can't imagine it would have.

Yes you read that correctly, trump wrote the law himself in order to show Hillary and all of their supporters that having sensitive documents outside of the White House is a crime - then proceeds to go break the one rule he strengthened in office destined for his opponent.

wvl4j0,"The passing along of collective knowledge shouldn't cost anyone a fucking thing in the first place. An educated society is a net positive, both domestically and in terms of advancing the human race. You think these immensely profitable colleges and universities discovered the knowledge they empart? Other than in the very few instances where they have made such discovery/revelation, they're not exactly peddling anything new.

So where's the merit of their having any claim to profit off the shared knowledge of our understanding of the world around us, that's been passed on down the line throughout human history? 

Oh, that's right, there is none. They didn't create, nor do they own, the knowledge they share. And for the betterment of society, it goddamned well should be shared. The fact it isn't, and that asshats think that's just fine, is precisely why we've got a bunch of undereducated, knuckle-dragging mouth breathers dragging down the country's collective IQ. 

And it's also why we're continuing to be stomped into intellectual irrelevance by countries, and the citizens who inhabit them, who understand this very basic concept.

Let me spell it out for you: 

An abundance of free higher education = good things for the US.

Things the way they are = not helping our standing in an advancing wold.

Just look around at all the intellectual ""greatness"" on display in this once-great nation. That's all anyone should need to do to say, ""yeah, you know what, take our tax money and pay for anyone who actually wants to get an education! It's better than bailing out businesses who aren't run fiscally responsibly and then need to gov to step in and ""save them"" from failure.

Maybe that's where we go wrong. We (as a collective) seem to permit our tax money going to help the wealthy to not fail, rather than to give the masses the opportunity to actually explore their utmost potential...unless they're willing to pay for it. And pay heftily.

So what do we get? Lots of people who eschew higher education altogether because they refuse to go into such debt in order to get an education that isn't a guarantee they'll find good paying work in the first place.   What a great, and sensible, system!! 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️

Imagine all the untapped potential we've pissed away over just the last 40 years...while other countries people now bitch about here in the US were doing the right thing and making sure all that is accessible and not for-profit. And they're lapping us regularly because of such apathy.

You don’t need to buy a house that’s “2021 sized”. Buy a smaller fucking house. If you wanna compare to the 1950s to make a point that we “lost”, then make it an accurate comparison. Comparing a house that’s 3x as large with a ton of modern amenities to a 1950s house is absolutely asinine. 

Also, do you think they had access to high quality healthcare in the 1950s? Lmaoooooooo 😂😂😂 Yes, it’s still unaffordable for a small percent of people, and we should work to get them covered, but the overwhelming majority of people have better access to better healthcare now than they did then.

Plot twist: my husband and I had a baby before we were married, I'm covered in tattoos, didn't grow up in church and my church felt I was a good fit to run our youth program when I approached about being more involved. I am broken, and I am honest about that. I hate when people in ministry act like they're perfect. We are supposed to witness to people about God's grace.

We're mostly concerned with ourselves and don't really meddle in other people's affairs (as far as women should command their own bodies, etc). We believe Lucifer was real, and did fall from Heaven.

We focus on personal growth and knowledge over anything else. Most of us follow the Eleven Satanic Commandments of The Earth, including myself. These include standard things: don't murder, don't engage in sexual conduct without being given consent, don't kill animals unless you intend to utilize them, respect others in their homes, etc.

It’s ironic that a few people I know... they bragged about not wearing a mask.  Like they were proud of it. Then they got Covid. And 2 of them suffered pretty badly... and now have lung damage.  

Last late April/early May I made a post about how I was born with 2 congenital lung defects and 5 congenital heart defects.   How I have Copd.  One working lung. Bronchiolitis obliterans.  Pulmonary hypertension.  Pulmonary fibrosis.  Nothing could’ve been done to stop it.  And I would’ve given anything to at least have the chance.  Wearing mask isn’t 100%.  But its still a chance.  It’s such a simple thing to do.   And yet people laugh at people would wears a  mask... a mask doesn’t take away your freedom.  Lung damage does.   

And now the 2 people I know are suffering from lung damage because of Covid... and they have to wear masks inside the hospital because now they have new drs and have to do regular test.  And it’s obviously much harder to wear a mask with lung damage... maybe they would’ve caught anyways.  But maybe they wouldn’t have...

138lxlh,"The neat part is it doesn't say that, at least not as simply put. 

Yes you can repent, but the Bible specifically outlines many times that if you don't mean it when you repent it doesn't count. So let's say you rape babies. You repent every time you do it. Its not a clean slate like confession for catholics because you ***kept doing it***. The definition of repentance is you know you done fucked up and know in your heart that its wrong and want to stop. You can't just say ""oopsy, sorry God I splurged a bit and raped another 3 babies this week. Why you make me so quirky teehee. im sowwy, forgiveness?👉🥺👈"" The catholics found the ultimate loophole by putting a normal dude as speaker for God. God, by decree of the pope, has said that many animals we know as mammals are in fact fish and perfectly edible for lint and for dinner on Fridays. You can't eat icecream but you can drink a milkshake. You can rape all the little boys and girls you want as long as its only up the butt as sodomy isn't sex!  This also applies to premarital.

You gotta mean it to repent and the amount of loopholes these people will try to abuse is staggering to do there depraved shit.

Of course it does say atheists will go to hell as God is a narcissistic jackass who says many times worship me or else. Hell there are like 3 commandments that say it in different words because it needed outlining so people couldn't loophole it and there wasn't enough room on one stone slab to say it all.",2023-05-05 17:58:01

uhdpvc,"i’m pro life and i agree with this. i think it’s a good idea for men to have vasectomies until they are financially/emotionally stable enough to potentially have children.
people are going to have sex regardless. no one can control that. and sometimes people mess up and get pregnant. so though i am pro life, lots of people believe aborting is the way to go. and i also don’t think anyone just wants to get an abortion, most people get them because it’s the only option they have; some women are at severe health risks carrying a child, some are not financially stable, some are too young, etc etc, and aborting it might just be best for their situation.
so if there was a way to prevent abortions/unwanted pregnancies, which could potentially be vasectomies, then i agree with this.

Thank you to all who have provided the facts that have shown my errors. *(I prefer to keep my original statements available for those who might see this comment thread later.)*

I still do think it would be valuable to research more effective and safer vasectomies, because a bigger variety of contraceptives is always better, in my opinion.

The point is, the ""medical procedure"" requires the birth, but the birth does not require the medical procedure.

The vasectomy requires the medical procedure, you can't have one without the other.

We don't require the medical procedure built around births, why would we require the medical procedure of a vasectomy.

That was probably why he didn’t try to be politically correct lol I absolutely knew from context that he was taking a huge risk and expressing himself so compassionately in the open in a place where he lived. 

Also, and this is a *super* fringe opinion within the community, but I’m personally totally cool with progressive people from homophobic communities using my slurs in a positive, reappropriative way in one-on-one conversations with me to mock homophobia, just like he did. I see them as victims of homophobia too because they’ve had to hide their support for safety and overcame much more than the average ally in supporting us. I’m sure he’s never said that word in a derogatory sense in his life and was just referencing a subset of “as long as I can’t tell” homophobes. Even noticing that as homophobia shows me investment and sincerity because it’s hard to notice that as homophobia if you’ve never been exposed to anything else. I’m proud of Gary lol he’s looking out for us d-wordy types 😂

Edit: Also, we were on his business property and people could hear. I’ve never thought about the fact he could have lost business or employees and decided it was important he let me know he supported me anyways. Wow, I’m so glad you posted this! I’m even more appreciative now 😭",2023-04-10 00:18:04

I get the sense he wasn’t shy, and frankly, he’s probably done more and taken on more risk for our rights by staying there, being himself, and telling people outright that we aren’t monsters than I’ve ever done for our community. In the moment I struggled to respond, but it was only because I did not want to make him think he’d offended me. 

Damn, I need to start pinching my pennies and take a trip to see if he’s still there. Seriously, I struggle with finding positivity and focusing on gratitude and this thread has helped me with that today. Thanks for this!

n19w2e,"In America this is generally considered weak mentality. If you can't be successful on your own then you are considered weak and pathetic.

Why do they get paid leave and not me? Why should I pay for them to get paid maternity leave?"". To a certain extent yes you should be able to support yourself in general but that mentality usually extends to politics which then effects basic human rights which is dumb. 


A perfect example of this is health care in the US. Business owners don't see why they need to pay for health insurance for their employees or if they do, they don't see why it should cover anything more than a basic doctor visit. Work providing a health insurance plan that includes birth control is a very controversial topic.  Then politicians don't see why they should invest in universal health care if work places already provide health insurance to it's workers.

l2x9lj,"My wife and I are the co-founders and the heads of operation, for a kitten rescue focusing primarily on seeing kittens who we foster both in our home, and in the homes of several members of our physical network adopted into loving families! In the last year went from fostering for other rescues, to becoming a rescue ourselves, and making this our full time occupation!  As a matter of fact, the whole family is involved! My 11 year old daughter, home full time herself to attend classes via distance learning, is an active participant in our mission and she has become an invaluable member of the team, she has learned a lot about the care and maintenance this species requires, and we are very proud of her! My 16 year old son, well, he likes to pet the kittens sometimes, and they certainly require that as well, but he’s not big on getting his hands dirty, but he still is big help with a number of other chores around the house and he has come along with me to resupply our other fosters at times. He’s a good lad! 

 To sustain this mission, we are filing a 501(c)3 packet this year, but in the meantime, instead of asking for donation, we make very clear that what we instead do is “collect gifts”. We do so through engagement of several community members of our online community, as well as others. The Gifts we request and collect can be found on an Amazon wishlist on our Facebook public group, but sometimes there are more significant needs, for instance, sometimes we gladly accept the pledge of a member willing to pay one of our veterinary partners for a variety of services they provide us, (at a discounted rate.) These include: Well certificate/“Check-up” vet visits, spay and neuter procedures, and occasionally, there is a need for emergent clinical intervention when necessary for sick or injured animals within our online and physical communities, but not exclusively, as sometimes another community network may not be having much success collecting pledges for a foster animal of their own. And if we are able, we would preferably offer to help them get pledged, rather than look the other way. Because when it involves a sick or injured animal who found themselves without a home and family, they are all of our responsibility. That’s just how we feel, and how we operate.

We can be found on Facebook at
 “The Hands That Feed Kitten Rescue” 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/2769161806706400/?ref=share ... 
I’m not looking for any pledges or gifts, today, except the gift of having some of the lovely members of one of the better Reddit communities to also come join our Rescue’s public Facebook page, and when a need does arise, maybe one you great people can act on it, or, just share a post that will reach those inclined to lend a hand ... that feeds!

That’s not an excuse. If we can’t have cobalt without child labor and slavery then maybe we shouldn’t have cobalt.

He’s the one getting his cobalt from Africa. I agree that it’s the fault of Belgian Colonialism, but that doesn’t mean that Elon isn’t at fault.

aoqsxj,"Well what im referring to is the fact that males create an objective environment and a standard for women to battle within each other for affirmation and acceptance on a level of attraction. All in all no, men dont generally give a shit about small details but those small details make up a bigger picture. If we stretch it to extremes for example...a girl who dosesnt wash her clothes and never wears make up and doesnt present herself in a ""pretty"" manner isnt going to receive the same feedback as the girl who keeps her hair well done, is fashionable, always wearing something stylistic and different, and has make up on all day. The feedback im referring to is from men and it doesnt always come in the form of explicitly pointing out a dress but it comes from facial expression and how much men may smile at them.

So with all that being said there comes a hierarchical system that men create within women for competition of attractiveness. Men play it off as if they dont care to keep the discussion out of their mind but the key is the nonverbal feedback creating competition.

If we wanna get raw with it it really boils down to socio evolution where certain things that have meaning make that person more convincing to procreate with (money, clothes, cars, where you live, your skin tone etc.) and the more details you balance into attraction the more desirable you are and not many people want to spend their entire life alone. So theres that i could go on but wanna hear peoples response.

The test of reasonableness shows up all over our judicial system so it seems, well, reasonable to apply it here, too.

A school is staffed by educators and administrators. Educators and administrators should not *reasonably* be expected to be willing to use deadly force in the execution of their duties.

When people's answer is to employ armed security at schools, it blows my mind that we are one of the wealthiest countries in the world and apparently the best we can do for our kids is the Wild West or military dystopia.",2022-06-07 19:54:35

And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face,” said Fauci at that time.

I’m guessing no one will answer it properly, because they are too racist towards other people to see past their own bigoted noses and self-grandiose life to understand the true meaning to the definition of hypocrisy. “Only black people are cool,” says the mindless drones too afraid of going against the conformity. “White people are the reason for all the problems in the world,” says the complicit, hypocritical, self-righteous racist. “Systemic racism is everywhere,” quoth the raven nevermore; who sees through the eyes of Cognitive Bias.

Feminist Andrea Dwarkin states, “If you want a definition of what a coward is, it’s needing to push a whole class of people down so that you can walk on top of them.” — unwittingly she talks about herself and the Marxist movement she represents.

I think I walked into an echo chamber. This sub  is full of cucks and clucks. Ever see Wall-E? Remember the space cruise ship? Remember when the red drink all of a sudden became out of style because the blue drink on the screen told them so? Yeah, that’s pretty much everyone in here. Critical thinking?—more like critically stinking. It’s rancid in here. I’m guessing I spoke too much truth and will canceled like the cowards that run the “brains” of this psychological operation. 🤓🤯😳🤭",2021-05-17 05:07:33

I just wanted to chime in, since I hear this a lot. Though I can't speak for legislators (who always seem to get things wrong anyway), I can definitely say this is only ever the case with people who would be considered terrible from both sides of the isle.
The conservative side of the abortion issue has everything to do with the conservation of life. Saying conservatives don't care about life outside of the womb simply isn't true. The reason we are so passionate about this issue in particular is that unborn children can't defend themselves.
I know you probably will disagree with me on one thing or another, and that's fine. But it's good to get a mix of opinions. People who disagree with you aren't evil ☺",2021-05-16 23:11:21

No, man. There's no *maybe*. You need to open your eyes. Read a Bloomberg article or something. Jesus Christ. I am not here to educate you either so before you even ask no I will not Google for you. That's on you.




>but it speaks volumes about how bad people on Reddit want to hate the guy that they’re willing to just take the word of an ex. 



Yeah, you really got us. Reddit hates a psychopathic, abusive, narcissistic piece of shit. Really good ""gotcha"" there, my dude.




>Like maybe he IS a scumbag. But MAYBE, his ex has an axe to grind. 



Again, no maybe. Open your eyes, read the news. She *should* have an axe to grind. *That's what happens when you're married to a psycho.*




>My ex is a piece of shit. As the dad, I have full custody of the kids, which I feel is telling. 




That only means anything relatively. I.e., sure, maybe you're a ""better person"" than your ex. I don't know you. I don't know your ex. What frame of reference do I have for either of you? Why do you think it proves anything that you're allegedly marginally a better parent than *someone else* I've never met and will never give a fuck about? Wait, don't answer that. I don't care.



>She posts on social media all the time these vague references to being “an abuse survivor”. Get fucked. Never once in my life have I been abusive toward a female, and I’d challenge anyone to find anyone who would say I was. Yet here we are. Smh. 



Well. You refer to women as ""females"", and I've never known anyone to do that who wasn't a creepy incel or misogynist or just a weirdo. So.. maybe don't do that, just to start? We can really delve into the nitty gritty later but like... That is a *very* basic place to start, so let's try that. Okay? 👍


>So maybe he IS a piece of shit


Again, no maybe.



>but maybe she’s butt hurt about marrying an Uber rich guy and leaving with Jack shit.

Be more concerned with the criminal activities of
your goverment, which are funded by your own hard earned tax dollars. (Almost 100 trillion of which are off balance sheet transactions. Meaning, your government is too ashamed, or to afraid to let you know what they spent it on.)
...By the way, that is $100,000,000,000,000.

Now to add salt to the wound, im sure mostly everyone knows the money printing addiction of our government,, further devaluing your hard earned money and making you work harder and longer for the same or lesser quality of life.

Oh, and that hard earned retirement fund you entrusted to the government, social security, they tapped into that as well.  Only because they had debts to settle from being so careless with their money.  Dont worry, im sure theyll put it back before you retire.. 

Anyway, yea boo Trump. He only did more good for the country than most of the presidents. He didnt even take his salary as president and his net worth went from 4 billion to 3 billion while in office. Why couldnt his net worth quadruple or more after being in office like most of our selfless, morally pure presidents.

But there is a thing about using capital losses to offset capital gains in future years. 
So the fact that the total income in this table is -50 million means that until this dude makes a profit of +50 million he isn’t going to pay much in taxes. 
Not saying that that tax code is a good thing or that is a bad thing. Only that it’s there.

We’re not all billionaires. It would take 200-250 guys like me to earn $25M in a year. Put together, even assuming we’re all doing a good job with our deductions, our total tax bill would be something like $5M. Five times as much for the same money. People who don’t own houses and can’t itemize their deductions would pay even more. Working people pay more than rich people, simply put.

epccmd,"> Gotta be real and take small meaningful steps

It might be too late to take small meaningful steps, some of these issues require immediate attention & effort. 

> spend our economy into oblivion with blank checks

We should be able to get a budget from our politicians. It’s their job. They’re there for this specific reason: to tackle these kind of issues. 

> free college is moronic today

For example, unnecessary wars like Iraq & Afghanistan are moronic today. 

> the price of education is all over the place

the cost of those wars was exorbitant! But no one asked where we would get the money to fund them. And they were a clusterfuck!

> Reimbursed completed education for fields and industries where there is economic need is a much more practical first step.

Instead of going to war, using international agreements to de-escalate any conflict is a much more practical step to saving, not only money, but people’s lives as well. Decrease military defense spending, increase taxes for those in the highest bracket of income, legalize marijuana everywhere would all be great ways to get the funds that are necessary to pay for the programs that are ABSOLUTELY necessary (like M4A).

I am an independent, have mixed views, people should be able to gay marry and protect their weed farm with any weapon of their choice while not being taxes to death is a decent summary.

Also not looking back as I believe global warming is a thing, and the UN ICCP models are too conservative. I think the heat, fires, drought in California are going to get a lot worse sooner than they are predicting due to their conservative climate models that don't include feedback loops.

Mostly I miss the food and quality of weed and beer on the west coast. Lived in Portland Oregon from 2010 to 2016 and did a lot of work in Seattle.

The California government is running itself I to the ground as well. Done alot of work in Frisco I'm the last two decades. You literally could see that place rot in front of your eyes year after year.

If you move I would suggest saying you didn't come from Cali. Even in hyper liberal stares like Washington or Oregon will not welcome to with open arms. 

Oddly enough if you say you are from Hollywood (I went to hollywood high) it cancels the anti-cali sentiment. Works internationally as well. Say you are from the US, almost instant hate. Say you are from Hollywood and you get asked if you are an artist or have you meet celebs and then get invited to dinner

I heard some ruckus downstairs and woke up, a girl from the party stuck her head inside my room and I remembered her, “hi, name!” I said. She ran downstairs, more ruckus and then nothing. I was still too drunk to figure out what happened. Next morning the front door was open, my tv in a beanie bag, subwoofer in the drive way, dvd-player missing and they cut my lights to the Christmas tree. 

I called her and asked her to return my stuff. She hung up.

I called the police and told them what, when and who. They didn’t do anything and closed the investigation a day later. (Sweden. Police have zero fucks to give about things like this)

So I called her father and bluffed. Said I had fingerprints and already had the case open with the cops. I would drop the charges if she gave my stuff back + $150 for damages. 

It took her a few hours to come by with the money but the dvd-player was shipped to the literally the other side of the country. I told her to go get it and she did 😂

This is from the WHO/FAO [Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5693e.pdf) paper.

>This is an emerging area of scientific investigation. The extent to which glyphosate adversely
affects the normal functioning of the microbiota in the human gastrointestinal tract or the
gastrointestinal tract of mammalian models is unclear. However, it is unlikely, given the available
information on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, that this would occur from
glyphosate residues in the diet. 

[Glyphosate has limited short-term effects on commensal bacterial community composition in the gut environment due to sufficient aromatic amino acid levels](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749117328099)

>Recently, concerns have been raised that residues of glyphosate-based herbicides may interfere with the homeostasis of the intestinal bacterial community and thereby affect the health of humans or animals. 

>We found that glyphosate as well as the commercial formulation Glyfonova®450 PLUS administered at up to fifty times the established European Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI = 0.5 mg/kg body weight) had very limited effects on bacterial community composition in Sprague Dawley rats during a two-week exposure trial.

>We conclude that sufficient intestinal levels of aromatic amino acids provided by the diet alleviates the need for bacterial synthesis of aromatic amino acids and thus prevents an antimicrobial effect of glyphosate in vivo. ",2019-03-18 22:27:14

The truth is nobody cares if people like me or my family die - considering our well-being is ‘inconvenient’.  The true, disturbing nature of healthism is believing that people can control their health and circumstances 100%, and if they have something wrong with them, it’s their fault - that belief is responsible for so much horrible, apathetic, gross apathy and judgmental, ignorant assumptions that stigmatize so many groups of people - disabled folks, chronically ill folks, mentally ill folks, terminally ill folks, and so many more.  
People want to believe they can control their health out of fear - they’re afraid of being out of control of it and realizing that their health is pure luck that could give out at any time.  
I wish more healthists would realize that one day, inevitably, through one course or another for 90% of people, their health WILL fail them at some point and I honestly pity them on the day they realize none of it was ever under their control at all.

sl866m,">sources saying Canada has some of the highest taxes of any country in the world

Lol. You need to do a better job vetting your sources then. 

Even in a state like Texas that has no state income tax, someone making 100k a year will be taxed around 23%. 

>Too many things out there to verify everything of every country 🤷🏼‍♂️

It literally took me 30 seconds to pull up that Canadian tax calculator. 

If you're too lazy to verify misinformation when it comes your way, don't go around parroting that same misinformation by saying ""Well I have no idea, but I *heard* so and so say this."" It does nothing for public discourse but to muddle the facts and sow confusion.


>Is it just a rumor spread for propaganda? 

Yes

>Also, does that calculator include the healthcare?

Healthcare is funded through taxes, so yes",2022-02-05 18:24:35

But this argument is all about convoluting the waters. We live in a country where healthcare is a privilege, where students literally cannot default on student loans (thus eliminating virtually all risk banks have to assume when ""investing"" in us thus not allowing an education bubble burst, which has caused the rapid devaluation of a 4 year degree), and a handful of technology companies dominate every aspect of our lives. This argument is offensive; it's the laziest effort to defend our broken system and (you guessed it) assign personal responsibility to consumers (rather than dissect the fundamental problems at work.)

>To turn $100 into $110 is work. To turn 100 million into $110 million is inevitable. 📷[ **Edgar Bronfman**](https://www.forbes.com/quotes/author/edgar-bronfman)

Edit 2: If 4 year degrees weren't so prevalent, they would carry more value. **This is what I want.** My generation was told unions are evil and blue collar work is demeaning. Yet electricians and plumbers earn \~55k/year (average) which is more than entry level marketing roles **which require a 4 year degree (app. \~40k).** Education has become a predatory market. (But I suppose the people who disagreed with me on the original comment will find this equally absurd.)

A new thing they're saying, when we point out how deeply unpopular their opinion is? Comparing it to anti-abolitionists! 

*Lots of people wanted to keep slavery, but we were right to abolish it!* I kinda feel like wrecking my body to carry something that weakens me for most of a year is unpaid labor, which is similar to slavery...

This shit makes me **so angry.** I had an abortion ten years ago. I wasn't sad. It wasn't a heartwrenching decision. I don't think about what that nine-year-old would be like today at ALL. It was the right call, and I'd do the same thing tomorrow if it happened again.

It's so wrong that they will say anything they can think of to justify banning what other people do with their bodies. They're calling that little girl who was raped a woman.

How about republicans put their money where their mouth is.

So we can:
1.	Lock all down, which requires govt to actually work for people and not enriching their corporate buddies.
2.	Reopen responsibly, with mask wearing, distancing, and closing when spikes are happening.
3.	Say, fuck it, let the poor people die and have our already fucked medical system break even further.

Idealists would go for 1, realists would go for 2, except Americans are somewhat special in being stupid and can’t wear a fucking mask, so apparently 3 is the only option.  Sucks to be poor, I guess, and good luck on not having major symptoms when they inevitably get it 🤷‍♂️",2020-08-09 16:08:21

There is an investigation. It will be looking for evidence to support the allegations. If the allegations can't be supported then the investigation is dropped. If there is enough evidence, non circumstantial, then the evidence will be given to a prosecutor who will then present it to the grand jury.

The grand jury will decide if the evidence supports the charges, and if they do (they always do*), the prosecutor files the charges and arrest warrants are issued.

At this point there will be a bail hearing blah blah blah and it goes on.

Long story short, an investigation is a long long way away from a guilty conviction and sentencing. There is no reason to preemptively ruin someone's life during the investigation phase simply because there is an investigation.

Lol, I don't understand what your point is. All I said is that the previous president, the one that you reckon would dissuade Putin from pulling this shit. thought (or at least said) that Putin is pretty great.

>The Biden administration is a joke Afghanistan and now Ukraine they can’t due anything right

Trump's the one who signed that treaty with the Taliban. Biden just honoured it. Now he's treading carefully because no one wants a repeat of the Cold War. Do have any idea of how delicately the intricacies of this situation need to be managed? The US can't just barge into Ukraine because Russia's in the wrong. The possibility of a war with Russia going nuclear, no matter how slight, is a truly dreadful prospect that must be avoided. Right now, lots of countries are trying to balance helping Ukraine out with not causing Russia to get mad at them and declare war/cut them off from the major oil supplies that they control. The US had troops in Ukraine, training the Ukrainian military in the days leading up to Russia's invasion. They are aiding the Ukrainian government with supplies. They currently have troops in Germany ready to mobilise if Russia does manage to gain control of Ukraine's government and decides to attack a nearby NATO country. It's okay to stfu if you don't actually know what you're talking about.

>you guys still want to blame a guy who started 0 wars

Lmao, again, I was just responding to your comment that Trump would have handled this better. Trump is an unstable egomaniac who replaced any advisor who might tell him something he didn't want to hear with yes-men. He didn't start this conflict. I'm not blaming him for this conflict. All I was saying is that you're wrong about him being tough on Russia. There's a reason why that country's government interfered with the 2016 election to shift results in his favour. Russia and China both benefit from a destabilised US government with an unpredictable leader because it makes the US less of a threat to them. It's not hard to understand. I'm not a fan of Biden because he's just returning the US to the old status quo, but at least I can wake up and look at the news without finding out that POTUS has made a threat of nuclear war over twitter now.

>Too bad we didn’t ship the billions of dollars of weapons we left in Afghanistan for the Taliban to Ukraine. That would have completely modernized their military but no those weapons will be used to kill Americans around the world.

Do you think the Taliban is going to take up their old occupation once more? Really? Fuck no. They would very clearly rather avoid giving anything resembling a Western military superpower an excuse to fuck them up again. They have what they wanted, which is the US out of Afghanistan. They'll fuck up people in their own country (which makes me angry as fuck), but not the USA. They don't want to have to deal with that again. They're gonna focus on consolidating power in their own country, organising their government, securing their regime.

>As for my gun ownership. We are being invaded from the southern border you just don’t realize it yet. You will when the cartels start to play a bigger role.

You are not being invaded, oh my fucking god 🙄. You melodramatic fool, get your news from somewhere other than Facebook. Also, I'm from a different country. Hence why I have a clearer view of this.

It’s death. With the stand your ground laws t is perfectly acceptable to shoot and kill anyone for trying to steal from you. The CT loves law and order and will not convict, or in most cases even charge, cops. The CT tried to take over the Capitol to kill opposition politicians, killed some people, destroyed property and wasn’t punished. I’m not a Democrat, they’re just as corrupt as the CT Republicans, that’s why the USA is quickly becoming the Holy States of Americastan. Even regular Republican voters know something is rotten in Washington. They get mocked, not for wanting change, but for thinking that trump and his ilk are going to be the ones to get it for them.

vajsi4,"Don't apologize, as a fellow ""worry wart"" I completely understand. The pandemic doesn't help. Not having health insurance is tough, chicken and the egg. I would research your rights under ADA and what an employer can request when you request an accommodation. I know an employer can request a doctor's note, It doesn't have to require specifics, only that you qualify and how/if that may affect your safety doing the job. That doesn't mean an employer is going to ask for a note, just preparing you
Unfortunately 🤪 I've had experience writing letters to get various things covered through medical insurance. I realize it's not the same thing but a similar process applies.  In my experience, researching what's required (In this case ADA statutes, You may also be able to find sample anxiety accommodations online). Then writing a letter addressing why you meet the qualifications (It took me 2 weeks because of my anxiety, one sentence at a time) has the most success. My doctor's prefer when I do this because simply asking for information to be provided is so vague. 
A piece of advice about insurance has always stuck with me and I think it applies to most things in life. 
Even when a diagnosis is given, insurance can't assume how it impacts an individual. Make sure your documentation tells a story and spells everything out.
Good luck I'll be thinking about you!",2022-06-13 05:03:52

Everything had to be “by the book” & if you blew off the custody of weapons or lost ammunition, then you would be #FAFO’d & getting major charges.

Sometimes good people do silly or bad things that they regret and it might get them in trouble or embarrassed later on in life, and as a good person they feel bad about it and think maybe the best way to own their mistake is to apologize and even remove themselves from the public eye.

They didn’t really have to because no one is forcing them, but something inside them felt like it was the right thing to do even if most people think just realizing and learning from the mistake was good enough.

This might have been true of the ""old"" republican party, but I'm not sure it applies to MAGA republicans, who are overwhelmingly made up of fundamental Christians who don't believe that the ""word and will of God"" can ever be changed to please society. These MAGA republicans don't believe in adaptation; there is no way for them to adapt a new stance on abortion rights - they either believe abortion is murder or not; there is no way for them to adapt a new stance on fluid expressions of gender - they either believe gender identity is binary or not.

Current republican ideology embodies rigid societal structures, and those will either stand or crumble....

ksu7hs,"I agree, hope can be good thing. Unfortunately sometimes not that much cos than you cling to that hope and you don't realize you got cheated, all because you didn't want to let go of hope.

I'm speaking from experience, as some 20 years ago same thing happened in my country(Serbia). The people were polarised on two sides, with each side telling their people that those other ones are traitors to our country. And when finally change came and revolution happened(due to stolen elections) we were all full of hope that better times are coming, alas it turned out that change was only on paper and that those new ones were the same as the old ones, lying stealing bastards, all the same.

And now after 30 years of political struggles we are in the same place we were at the beginning, maybe even worse and all I can thinks about is how every time someone promised us changes for the good of people ended up screwing us and destroying our hopes and our belief in people and the government/politicians.

And then Bernie showed up and I had that hope once more(since everything that happens in USA reflects on the whole world) That was one of the reasons I was mad, you guys missed it with Bernie. That man was constant all his life, never changing and more importantly he had been fighting for the good of the people without compromise and he has deeds to back this up not just empty words and that's a huge deal in my book. Hopefully AOC will continue in his footsteps and than maybe there''s still some hope for you guys.🙂",2021-01-09 02:33:30

This is a straight up lie. 

Go to any conservative leanings sub and you’ll see that their top posts are memes or pictures. 

To say the right side is the factual side when they are most likely to deny science is just absurd.

pe8p1m,"They do, but what's REALLY in their best interest is mutually sabotaging the existing system with the resources of all of those companies combined. They make it so complicated and expensive and impossible to use or navigate that it's guaranteed to make them money off our suffering. Insurance companies, the FDA, big banks, big tobacco, coal and petroleum and oil, pharmaceutical companies, HOSPITALS, consumer conglomerates (Nestle, Amazon, Kellogg's, Johnson & Johnson, Kraft, etc.), are all profiting off of us and many of us are just degrading without proper physical and mental healthcare. Why are mental health, teeth, and eyes not covered under primary health insurance? Are they not part of our bodies? Why do we pay co-pays and pay for our drugs out of pocket, and for ambulance rides? Why aren't those covered by the insurance WE ALREADY PAY? It's like paying for cable. You are literally paying to be advertised to. Why aren't there any/nearly enough studies on medicinal herbs? Why aren't vitamins regulated and held to efficacy standards? So that we cannot reliably use them as medicines? Why don't city planners plant fruit trees instead of decorative ones? Why don't we have community gardens every other block? Why isn't there a budget for that? Why aren't we all taught about local herbs and sustainable foraging from the time we're young so we can literally eat off the land? Why don't we have solar panels that power the country? These are literally all things we could have.

Because people are making so much money off of us, man. Off of poisoning us, making us fat, selling us cigarettes, and alcohol on TV and in music and at football games, and brainwashing us with constant advertisement of  prescription drugs and plastic crap we need to buy, then making us miserable with infotainment news and political shitshows, making us all hate each other with caricatures of ideologies, exploiting our labor for horrifically low wages, monopolizing housing so we can never own anything. The fact that it's so interconnected gives me the extreme and overwhelming sensation that this country will not exist for much longer. 

As a kid it always seemed to me that the USA wouldn't make it to 300 years. But I was just using kid logic. It might be like 300-320. I don't know. But there's no way this is sustainable for more than 30 or 40 more years but they'll drag it out another 30 or more.

k20bm3,"In this episode of ""Black Broad says shit to make her feel more comfortable about her innate stupidity""...
Sounds like someone has to get ahold of their multidimensional failures instead of feeding those insecurities with support from other equally as un-""gifted"" minorities. This is a perfect image of how ""crabs"" stay at the bottom of the barrel in society. They cry that a system isn't flourishing because it's withholding the development of intelligence, yet NEVER cry about the development of intelligence withholding the flourishing of a system. Let me guess, this cow supports all of Biden's platforms like the rest of the leeches supporting this filth here? Or, let me guess, a twisted one liner like ""Found the gifted kid"" is much more suitable of a response than actually talking about the idiocy this is giving way to? The Black Broad doesn't realize there are not going to be any more gifted children when everyone thinks they're the victims of a framework of society that doesn't lend them any help or resources when it literally gave way to the same network (Internet) you people use to complain about life and existence. Women/feminine men are literally killing academia; even community colleges aren't free from their scourge of self-centered morality. ""Ted Talk"" educated, obese minorities spouting off at the mouth about academia while White edgelords cut themselves on self-guilt deserve what's coming. You've left actual minority kids underserved to fend for themselves in the inner cities so you can have your clean phone screens reading inane amounts of useless information. Hey, I hope that stroking your own egos helps y'all sleep at night, because it certainly doesn't help the amount of kids who can't afford a computer to even attend virtual learning right now with anything. Imagine thinking you can have an existential crisis spiraling out of control when you don't even know how to control your own existence properly. 😆",2020-11-28 19:26:50

cg464z,I sure hope she uses something other than disposable plastic straws. I work at Starbucks and I’m always a little concerned when people ask for a straw for their hot drinks. Those straws are obviously intended for iced drinks so I’m not convinced they’re even safe to use with hot coffee because plastic can leech chemicals under certain temperatures. All of this is just based on assumption though 🤷‍♀️,2019-07-22 02:03:55
cg464z,"Thank you!!!! I literally cannot lift a drink to my face without spilling/dropping it/injuring myself, & this tweet’s tone really sucks. I also often aspirate liquids when not drinking through a straw, & have sensitive teeth (though that’s the least pressing issue I have.) 

For those who CAN pick up a drink, cool— definitely do that. But I cannot. I’m infantilized daily & I don’t need random people carrying this attitude around. 

Having to disclose to wait staff, etc, WHY I do in fact need a straw is humiliating. Disabled people’s needs are not recognized & we are seen as attention seeking, lazy, benefit-abusing babies if we don’t have an immediately recognizable illness, look anything less than half-dead, or aren’t *”inspiring”* in some way. I hate it. 

I have my own glass straw that I use at home, but sometimes when I’m out I have an unplanned treat & don’t have it on me. I can’t tell you the amount of rude comments, looks, & demands for explanations/personal medical information that I’ve been given by employees of businesses I give money to, because I asked for a straw. & I use mobility aids/a wheelchair, & do not look like the perfect picture of good health. It’s even worse for those with less visible illnesses/disabilities. 

Thank you for speaking up!!! I’m not sure if you’re disabled, & you do not need to share whether you are or aren’t— but, if you aren’t, I cannot say how grateful I am to have you advocating for us. If you are, I feel the same way (thank you 🖤) it’s just that usually disabled people are the ones who are advocating & raising awareness of access issues for disabled people.",2019-07-22 06:00:05

Thanks so much for being on our side! I’m truly grateful. 

Totally— I absolutely get that & am with you. I know the person writing this didn’t do so with intent to harm! I’d say their intention was to motivate people to do better. It’s unfortunate that it’s harmful, regardless. 

Most people don’t even think about disabled people, tbh (I’m not moping or resentful, or being cynical, just stating what appears to be true,) so not knowing about the need for straws or other things like that makes total sense. 

*What upsets me is that there’s been a ton of disabled people advocating this issue, & so few non-disabled/non-chronically ill people are listening.* It’s disheartening. The other aspect that is hurtful is that so many people will read this tweet, or tweets like this, & they will carry this energy into their real life exchanges— choosing to be snippy & reductive, instead of empathetic & openminded— & that’s the attitude we’ve been getting ever since the straw issue took off. I don’t think that that fire needs anymore feeding.

Thanks, again! The people you work with are lucky to have someone like you on their team. Best of luck in your studies & future career! ✨

*(I actually wrote another lengthy paragraph about the emotional & social issues I & many others face for needing certain accommodations, but I didn’t want to seem like I was addressing you specifically, iamdinosaurRAWR— I wrote it to further explain to those reading this thread, who are still struggling to understand why its important, & illustrate that this isn’t disabled & chronically ill people being not picky.

cg464z,"I think most of you don’t understand the actual pain of real sensitive teeth. There are also special needs people that need them. It’s ignorant and honestly kind of intolerant. What’s  selfish is to limit less abled people’s options because of your irrational belief that their insignificant straw usage does anything. 

This whole straw thing is just a stupid way that people can low effort feel like they’re doing something when they’re making almost no difference at all. Then you can all pat yourselves on the back for making a difference without any *real* effort or sacrifice at all. Meanwhile, you childishly call people that need them selfish. Absurd.

The sad thing is it’s working. You’re all tripping over yourselves about the straw thing and the real issues, like the fishing industry royally fucking our ocean with assloads of plastic, just rolls right under your radar. But that’s fine. You’d have to actually give something up or put in some effort to enact change there. Easier just to stick your head in the sand and not use straws. 🙄",2019-07-22 03:37:08

One managed because nobody stop him. Another one didn't because some stoped him.

Both wanted, both acted.

You evaluate the situations by there outcome. 

When you attempt to do something bad, you are punished, even if you fail.

She tested negative for it upon readmission but the pneumonia from it killed her. Anyone KNOWINGLY spreading COVID-19 should be JAILED! We don't know how my aunt got it but it took her life. She was an extremely healthy 90 year old who still traveled every summer to stay with family. She was taken from us and it's NOT fair! To make matters worse, I didn't get to see her this past summer. I was feeling a bit under the weather and got COVID tested. My symptoms cleared before she left BUT it took CVS 15 DAYS and my going on local media to FINALLY get my results. I was negative but missed seeing her because of the incompetence of CVS. I will NEVER forgive them now! I'm looking for a new pharmacy as we speak. RIP Aunt Jewel 💎! You truly were a gem! ❤️",2021-01-03 18:16:52

koxb2g,"And every time one of you come out of the woodwork the death rate really does get worse. Do you know what morbidity rates are? They are underlying conditions that contribute to a death. Very very very very little healthy people with no underlying conditions die from COVID-19. 

Yes I get the reality of the US is that we are filled with obese, diabetic people with heart disease who don’t take care of their health. Which I can totally relate to. I used to shoot fentanyl in my veins. And guess what? Society doesn’t give a fuck about addicts and treat them like animals. So I changed my life and I made better decisions to protect my health and status. 

So why should anyone give a fuck about the apparent 1/50 (I can’t find any numbers supporting this) who die because they also don’t respect their bodies? 

Why should normal healthy people have to shut down their ability to feed their families so your shitty family get protected from a disease? 

The data clearly shows that we should focus on protecting the elderly and morbidly sick people. Which if you’re fuckin morbidly sick then MAYBE you should sit out the pandemic permanently until you get the vaccine. Let everyone else get on with their lives. 

Yet nobody gives a shit about the increased mortality rates of anything else affected by the handling of the pandemic. 

So fuck all them I guess. Don’t be surprised when the response is fuck you too 🤷🏻‍♀️",2021-01-03 01:26:28

cafop6,"Your notion is fantastic, I will just say this: the women touring the country that just won...they’re not the women we need to help feed. There’s a league of hundreds of PROFESSIONAL women, who go toe to toe with these women every week, they need our help. The NWSL has a minimum salary of $16,000 with a MAX of $43,000. The women who won the World Cup don’t get paid by their NWSL teams due to their US Soccer contract, luckily that pays a minimum of $100,000 more per year + endorsements. Before this World Cup, Crystal Dunn had an approximate net worth of (iirc) $6m!!!

You can support the women who balance a soccer career and side job(s) and have to live with a host family and shower after their practice in a trailer. The trailer is new, by the way. It was brought in at the end of last summer. Sky Blue uses a community park with no changing rooms to train and play at Rutgers for their *professional* league. Those are the women we need to help. 

They can be helped by finding a team (pick your favorite US player and find her club team. I’m partial to the Orlando Pride 😏) and supporting from home! Watch when they have their weekly ESPN game. Watch their games on Yahoo (and yahoo sports). Buy an NWSL jersey. It will make you seem super hipster with your Reign FC Rapinoe Jersey vs her USA one.

And I will start listening to the Sanctity of Life™ argument as soon as the people trying to outlaw abortion start caring about children after they are born. When they stop trying to defund public education or assistance programs like SNAP and stop kidnapping children at the border and holding them in cages without soap or toothbrushes (because basic hygeine is apparently unnecessary in cramped, overcrowded, dirty conditions) they can talk about valuing life.",2019-07-08 16:03:02

pk8ffu,"~~Otherwise, the symbol is meaningless. It's just an arbitrary shape.~~ Whoops, mixed my words up. It's ***because*** of its shape that it carries meaning. 

Also, I wanted to address that this isn't a historical/mathematical perspective on the shapes. John Q. Math didn't sit down one day and come up with the cute pictures that tell you what to do on your homework. Rather, I'm explaining **why I think the most widely-used symbols have some design to them that conveys their function**. 

We can see this works with the symbols for basic arithmetic. Given that `|` is a `number`, we can see:

* `+` combines 2 `|` to create a new `number`

* `-` removes a `|` from this new `number` to make a smaller one

* `*` creates many `|` to create a `number` intrinsically ""bigger"" or ""heavier"" than `+` by **adding many** `|` 

* `➗` splits a `|` into smaller equally sized `.`

This is why many people can easily grasp basic arithmetic, but begin to struggle with algebra and calculus, IMO. Many of the symbols begin to carry less semantic meaning. This is purposeful; the abstraction attempts to keep the mathematician from anchoring to arbitrary axioms. For example, the rules I gave for the basic operators don't entirely encapsulate their purely mathematical counterparts (e.g. my division scheme doesn't address remainders, etc.). But as far as trying to *teach* the material in an efficient manner where the students learn what the operators are *doing*, instead of rotely-memorizing the outputs. You see many people say they started to get lost around the time they introduced `x` in algebra, and it makes sense. What about the symbol `x` conveys a mystery number? `x` seems more like a `rotation of a multiplication`, maybe something to do with exponentials or complex numbers, but that's already straying too far from the topic at hand.",2021-09-08 14:14:01

pk8ffu,"More than and less than works great for me. Here’s why, the crocodile 🐊 mouth is facing the larger number so it looks like the teacher was telling me here’s this little number with a crocodile mouth facing the larger number, so therefore in my kid brain I was like ok so the mouth is open towards the larger number so the smaller number is eating the larger number so it is greater than the larger number! Nah and they thought I was an idiot then. So, the crocodile didn’t work for me at all. However; greater/less than did because if you place the larger number on the left side or right side as long as angle of that signifier is larger (“wider angle”) facing towards the larger number, the reason being is that it’s greater than the number on the right or left side signified by the (smaller angle; point) facing the direction of the the smaller number and that made perfect sense. Greater than and leas than saved me in kindergarten. And then the topic of angles explaining it helps to conceptualize angles later on in geometry/trig.  I think math is fun and easy when explained well but being able to do that lies in the hands of the teacher/professor and they have to be able to explain 3 maybe 5 different ways or they’ll risk losing part of the class let alone different generations.",2021-09-08 20:12:46

When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, “You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.”   Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, and plotted together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. But they said, “Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.”   Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,  a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table. And when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste? For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor.” But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me.  For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.  In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial.  Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”   Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, “What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?” And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.   Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?” He said, “Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.’”  And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.   When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve.  And as they were eating, he said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.”  And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, “Is it I, Lord?” He answered, “He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me.  The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”  Judas, who would betray him, answered, “Is it I, Rabbi?” He said to him, “You have said so.”   Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”  And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you,  for this is my blood of the  covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.  I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”   And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’  But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.”  Peter answered him, “Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.” Jesus said to him, “Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”  Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!” And all the disciples said the same.   Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go over there and pray.”  And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch  with me.”  And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”  And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, “So, could you not watch with me one hour?  Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”  Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.”  And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Sleep and take your rest later on.  See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”   While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man; seize him.” And he came up to Jesus at once and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” And he kissed him. Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you came to do.” Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.  Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?  But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?”  At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.  But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”  Then all the disciples left him and fled.   Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. Now the chief priests and the whole council  were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.’” And the high priest stood up and said, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?”  But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, “I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.” Jesus said to him, “You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”  Then the high priest tore his robes and said, “He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your judgment?” They answered, “He deserves death.” Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him, saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?”   Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.” But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you mean.” And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.” And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man.” After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you.” Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know the man.” And immediately the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.

Never said it was against the law, just more laughing at the backwards thought process that lands you at “it’s not safe to go out and vote by person, but I’ll show up to where everyone else votes by person, in an attempt to cause drama” (sounds real Christian) 

“He who is without sin shall cast the first stone” not “those without guilt” I’m very familiar, I just don’t think you actually are. You know, thinks like name calling and insulting someone’s intelligence isn’t exactly a very religious thing to do. (Tell me which one of us is trying to use religion against the other again? 

Where did I say anything about wearing a hat? I love this constant deflections tho. Keep them coming. My belief of you censoring people doesn’t come from you wanting to wear a hat. It’s having the belief to wear a shirt “better American than republican” and you were happy about wearing it? You know what the funniest part of that is? “America” is a “republic”.  “Better American than America” 😂😂😂😂 btw since you wanna speak on religion, you do know pride is sinful right? Just figured I’d make that connection for you. So being proud that you wore that shirt with no good intentions, that’s very sinful (no longer free to cast the first stone) 🤦‍♂️

Do you have any proof that then republicans rigged the election? Because from what I’m seeing it’s looking a lot more like the democrats attempted to rig the election. Or 1 shred of evidence that shows anyone is threatening violence on the Republican side.


Lmfao wait I just realized you called me a troll while saying “the mere thought of it appears to have triggered you, so big success” that’s literally the goal of a troll, to say something in an attempt to rile up someone and get a reaction. The hypocrisy that flies outta your head. Although I’m sure this will be downvoted since I didn’t conform to societal pressures and instead continued to use my critical thinking and FREEDOM of speech. 

Btw what you’re attempting to do is gaslighting, and straw manning. Neither of which are going to work. 🤦‍♂️ thanks for the laugh. It is obvious you are still bothered by the 2016 election, and not of stable mind. It’s okay.

Edit: the only part of this I actually want any kind of a reply to is this evidence of election rigging and enticing violence. Because it was democrats wishing the streets would fill with more BLM riots, 70+ million people are mad at the results. I didn’t see a single riot. And all this election fraud evidence is pointing to votes being flipped FOR BIDEN/Democrats, not for TRUMP/republicans. But it’s ok, you keep doing you. When I come back here in 5 days and all you’ve done is break this all down, answering line by line thinking you’re doing something. All the way while it’s just proving my point that all you are is a troll with terrible attempts. Trying to use the bible against me, without even getting the quote right, while showing pride in the attempt to upset others. You wanna talk about religion? How about “love thy neighbors”?

I dont care about claims he was fired, went to Mars, or got elected President. I am arguing against your disbelief that a company would ever report a crime that was disclosed to them to the police. Because they would. And do. Because federal laws obligate them to in certain instances, like sex crimes committed at work / using company property. [Here are some case studies outlining an employers obligation to report crimes of all types. ](https://www.cozen.com/admin/files/publications/Hayes_Employers_Duty_to_Report.pdf?embed=1) Despite you downplaying this as just gossip about nudes, it is, as ive said before, an actual crime with actual victims both of which are employed by the company.

No bullshit. If five police are on scene and facing a suspect and four cops are yelling incoherent, unintelligible commands (instead of de-escalating) and one of the cops is screaming, ""put your guns down, he's holding a.phone!"", when the other four cops murder that person the cop who didn't shoot will get fired. Policing is rotten from top to bottom and inside out.

n3fb2i,So my dilemma lately has been anxiety about going back to school. On the one hand the service industry is an unfulfilling slog but on the other hand it’s paying me really well atm. The part of me that longs for purpose wants to finish school but doesn’t know how BUT I don’t think it would even be worth it to cut back on working to take on all the debt to graduate into a field that pays worse than my unskilled labor anyway 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️,2021-05-03 02:01:40
n3fb2i,"When your parents told you to go to college they probably meant stem or medicine though...

I had one professor tell me english/language majors were quick hires too so maybe there's some room. Feel like a degree in so many fields were already so bogus and they're worth even less today. Not to mention the numerous degrees that only pay well as consultants, because the average of those positions are between bank and unhirable, so people the average and think that's a good field.

Tbh though a degree in like art is cool for learning or perfecting skills and maybe networking but doesn't seem to pay very well except under specific context. Think it would be better if it was a trade 😬",2021-05-03 05:34:20

I'm not afraid of the hard work now but I went through MOST college (had to move  stupid pandemic) and the next level of this long-con they put us through is the expectation to have experience and a degree for entry level. So they want you to intern and just not survive. 🤷‍♂️",2021-05-03 00:24:40

He suspends accounts for breaking that rule, They know the answer. They are journalists, If they didn’t know then they aren’t that great at journalism. I’d say reinstate the accounts after a week and send out a detailed correspondence before suspension is lifted. Like an I agree or don’t agree type of thing. If they do it again the. Permanently suspend them because at that point it’s clear they just don’t care. 🤷🏻‍♂️. I’m broke AF and I still don’t want my 1:1 location out there. For what?

IMO personal safety goes above all as long as you don’t destroy free speech. https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/twitter-elonjet-account-suspended/  a detailed reason why he did what he did even though this suspension was after that incident. We have no reason to be paranoid about the public, Every billionaire world wide does. We will never understand what happens on the back end of their lives just like our own. We know we all go through shit but we don’t know the extent. Lift the suspension, Do the whole delayed crap he was talking about and move forward. From the beginning he said free speech is absolute as long as it doesn’t come from a place of violence or potentially incite violence. I’ve seen people getting shitted on at twitter and posts are still up. Just a few mo the ago it would of been reported and someone suspended or banned. You, I or anyone in the world will not make everyone happy. The quicker society comes to term with that the better society will be. That’s not to say you should t fight for what you believe in but, If it can potentially become lethal which with the article attached shows 1 instance. Then any person will do what feels right and that’s shut yourself out from the world to keep location..etc on the low. Look at what happens to music artists who get out of line from their norm, Their career is destroyed legit in a few days if not hrs. Always 2 sides to the same coin, I respectfully agree to disagree with people. We don’t have to have the same views to respect people’s perception of things.

They were running my medical insurance through dental and hadn't updated my medical insurance despite me presenting my card each time and refused to acknowledge that it was a data entry error. 

Finally, I called my insurance to figure out if there was anything they could do because the hospital had sent my bill to collections after a year and were refusing to look into the file notes made. The CS rep was crazy nice to begin with, but as soon as he heard my story, he geared up and went ""Oh ho ho, we're going to take care of this right now. Do you want to do a conference call? Or I can call them directly on your behalf, whatever you want."" I gladly let him call on his own, and not even two minutes later, he was back on the line and said everything was cleared and I'd be receiving a zero balance bill soon. I was so relieved I could have cried.

The hospital billing department manager also called me a few minutes later and said they had found the notes made in the file regarding the dental insurance error.

By countering body shaming with more bodyshaming you continue the bodyshamers work ☠️

Your information stating otherwise should be the obvious framing of their statement (society wasn't ready for it yet!!! aren't we all so lgbt friendly in 2020, it's time to come together!), coupled with the fact they only made the statement to promote their new film, this wasn't some random interview, the interview question itself was likely planned.

The problem is many bills have a generally positive or seemingly direct title, but are packed with provisions that don’t even relate to the main subject at hand. The provision of a bill that made tobacco illegal for 21 and under, in my state, was tucked away in a completely unrelated bill. I believe the bill was about funding a building project of some kind. 

Regardless of political affiliation, we should strive for representatives who take the time to read all legislation that’s being voted upon. Sadly this doesn’t happen.

Is this the case here? I don’t know. But it’s highly likely, given the “Republican” viewpoint that something or some power was granted to the government that shouldn’t be the role of government.

Business' have to right to refuse service for any reason except for protected classes. Did you even read what I said? 

Race, nationality, sexual orientation, religion etc. Are all protected classes that businesses cannot discriminate against.

Also I might have misinterpreted what you meant by ""no harm no foul"" because that infers that you wouldnt care if a shop was discrimating a protected class? Maybe clarify?

Really isn’t an argument. Plus passports won’t actually  help the end user on anything. They’ll just be required but still have to quarantine, test etc. 

New York state isn’t even recognizing immunity after 90 days from last dose. Policy between states and countries will be so different many places you might have to be vaccinated 4 plus times a year just to get in, plus testing anyway 🙄 let alone variants and boosters for that as they appear.

Reasonable vaccination once a year is fine...but that's not what's going to happen. Half the world won't even get vaccines for over a year, the other half will have a policy mess so convoluted it won't matter functionally we'll be treated like un vaccinated anyway.

Theres going to be unscientific and overly aggressive measures for security theater. 

Those passports will be good for local venues but inter state and national travel is basically fucked for years.

The idea isn't negative inherently but being used to track ever interaction local, interstate and international isn't good and implementation won't benefit people directly, ""reopening"" won't be affected the way people think it will.

I get people are hopefull but frankly it's naive. Actual passports are not a pleasant experience, there won't be an international standard etc. 

This is good for going to the local bars in a state that has reasonable policy, not much else. Lots of free data otherwise and that's about it, it'll be required but you'll still be going through the same hoops as now.",2021-03-31 14:40:30

Connected to her wifi, sure.

But: No local coffee shops, no Starbucks shopping, etc. She avoids that shit like the plague.

She has a keurig that she exclusively buys folgers kcups at kohls with her 30% off coupons. No online shopping for coffee. No other/fancy brands or beans. 

At the time that this happened I was exclusively an herbal tea drinker. No coffee/caffeine at all. 


It stood out so much because: My ads are generally for things like: hiking/running gear, gardening supplies, dog stuff, books. My targeted ads are usually *really good* at knowing my interests, and I pay attention to them and will shop them. I actually think they know me better than I know me to an extent with how much I will jump for joy at the weirdest targeted shit (and then buy it). I just went into FB to see what my ads are and my first ad was for Merrell boots (which I have 2 pairs of), and then an author who is releasing a book in April that I already pre-ordered. Third was an LL Bean ad for an indoor/outdoor rug with 2 dogs on it (I bought 2 similar rugs from LL Bean back in November). Fourth was an ad for Keen boots (which I dont have but are similar to Merrells). This is pretty typical of what I see. Kickstarter floats in and out because I back a lot of board games. I got some ads for chicken coops and feed when I was googling raising chickens and trying to talk my husband into getting some... 


My ads are usually *spot on* (Well, until my friend went wedding dress shopping and sent a group of us pictures of the wedding dresses she was trying on in Facebook messenger, and for like a month I was bombarded with wedding ads). 


Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I am generally speaking incredibly aware of what information is used to target ads, and that when there are weird anomalies (wedding dresses) I can pinpoint the why/when/how of it.

Yes vote meant “no gay marriage.”

Another cool thing in California is if you get ill and cannot work, you get SSDI.  You do not need to purchase disability insurance because you already have it.   All my Republican co-workers believe every state offers this.  I cannot tell them anything.  They love having this compassionate SSDI and have no idea it is a liberal snowflake idea… 🤫",2022-10-19 23:10:40

I thought it was weird that Santa had written my name on the present in the same colour gel pens that my mother had bought. 

Add to that that a year or two prior I couldn’t sleep for excitement, and was worried Santa wouldn’t come in to put presents on the bed because I was awake. So I hid under the covers. I heard someone come in and I heard the crinkle of wrapping paper, so I flew out from under the covers and startled my mum. Kind of surprised to see her, I asked if she’d put them there just now “No, I came in to check on you, but I tripped on them”

The fact that you worded that little caricature as knowing the truth is kinda telling honestly unless you just worded it poorly

>stupid fairy tell

Nope nevermind, apparently you *do* think it's the end all be all truth. So you're not a ""very smart 15 year old kid who decides god isn’t real and then thinks he is smarter than everyone else because he knows the truth"", you're a ""very smart 20-something year old adult who decides god isn’t real and then thinks she is smarter than everyone else because she knows the truth""

I don't think the bible says anywhere ""fuck trannies lmao 😂👌"". That's just sound like a result of your own shitty family using it as justification though I see why you might draw the connection. You really oughta just cut them out of your life if you haven't already.

The right is conservative. They don't want their kid to get a trophy just for showing up. They want it to be earned. This is just a euphemism or whatever for even more things....

When you say ""society"", I hear, ""the left"".... And I think that's the problem. For a long time, I feel, the right was just fine with feeling different than the left. They understood the left was allowed to have feelings. I don't feel the same about the left....

If I don't want my kid rewarded for mediocrity, I'm allowed to think that way. And SHOULD respect me thinking that way....

To my point then, it certainly seemed as though the left didn't care what the right thought or felt, and really started to show it. Just the indoctrination in schools, for example.....

Conservatives DEFINITELY want their families left alone. I certainly don't feel like the left acts that way.

44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’

45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’

Also, those other places will understand more the strain it places on the community that they go to…….. even with just a few dozen immigrates verses hundreds of thousands that communities in the south are trying to cope with.

It’s so easy to tell someone else to accept the situation along our southern borders but I don’t see to many Congress people or senators or presidents taking in our new illegals (healthy or sick…COVID)

How many people do you accept in your house when you have only three bedrooms….???….6?7?8?9?10?……..at what point do you stop accepting before your own family dynamics collapses???
Don’t forget the food, toiletries, clothing, washing of clothes, travel to and from schools and work for your now new illegal family???

xeuy4f,"Immigration is not a problem if the community is large enough (i.e. time, money, resource and space rich)  ""absorb"" them as they are in this case.  Most people are welcoming in these scenarios.  

When the volume is ""too high"" (and it will be smaller for more insular/homogeneous communities), you get friction. I suspect if there were 2,000 flights the local community may not be as welcoming.

I wouldn't judge them though (or the migrants), they are people trying to make there way in life. 

It's just people in general will look to blame the ""different people"" if their (or their families) perceive life chances/survival are curbed/threatened. 

I am not sure politics would come into it, although you would hope that socialist/communist (who value the ""whole"") would be more welcoming - but given USSR in the past, we know that is not always the case.

Beyond there being ample evidence of its ineffectiveness, the restricted capacity itself is also arbitrary.  In some states it’s 15 rounds, in others it’s 10 rounds or 7 rounds.  I watched a politician ask the CEO of TikTok whether the app can access a person’s home Wi-Fi 🤦‍♂️, and these politicians are the ones deciding how many rounds a person might need in a future situation that cannot be predicted.

Magazine restrictions are one of many popular gun control proposals that almost nobody has bothered fact-checking or thinking critically about.  I think people just assume that anything labeled “gun control“ will automatically be affective.",2023-04-13 21:26:02

122mhqg,"nah, there are plenty of conservative artists, just not a lot of the true murrica guns n jesus types (they tend to view the arts as hoity toity librul cuck shit). many important artists of the 18th-20th centuries were some flavor of right winger (dali being a very open fascist comes to mind), and it feels like every few days there's some controversy with some popular contemporary artist online being an unhinged bigot.

as an aside, there is a preoccupation within fascism that there is some True Art Canon that we have degenerated from, and of course the True Art Canon is like, baroque paintings of nude biblical figures and statues of greek warriors and shit. nazis had a particular preoccupation with modern (especially queer and feminist) art and eradicating ""degenerate"" forms of art, which is a pattern we see continue into the modern day with tucker carlson types.

edit: everyone needs to watch ""Who's Afraid of Modern Art?"" by jacob geller. there is a common sentiment of ""ugh what happened to Real Art😒"", especially on here, in regards to modern, abstract, or installation art. i'm not saying that you HAVE to like modern art, but it is important to understand where that sentiment comes from and leads to.",2023-03-26 16:22:21

Taught us a pretty darned effective way of responding to a gish gallop during a formal (competitive) debate. Basically explained this tactic is ordinarily used to throw off the person they're using it against by trying to trick them into responding to several (unrelated) points hastily, and often running out of response time, or simply not being able to articulate reasoned responses to so many different ""points"" they're trying to refute.

The trick to turn that little tactic on its fucking head?

""Respectfully, since you've made multiple points quickly and without exposition that would each need an individual rebuttal, why don't you pick one and offer a more detailed argument on your stance for that particular statement? Might we give my opponent some time to make their case about one of their claims?""

Being well coached, every time someone ran into an opposing debater who gish galloped, we ended up turning the tables on them *while also making them look like a disingenuous debater.*

mjxb5o,You can tell a lot about a persons personality by their profile picture 😂,2021-04-05 00:15:21
mjxb5o,"For the life of me I have literally tried to prove the concept of “men and women can be just friends!” for years. I grew up surrounded by female cousins. I prefer to have female friends. I love femininity and men actually bore me. 

But the reality is that I have never had women be a true friend. They either “bench” you as a potential if their relationship is in trouble. And they literally just exploit men for their gender roles. Female friends are literally just a burden. And if they’re not fucking you then they are literally not offering anything that I can’t do or produce myself. 

Most men are too stupid to realize they’re being completely exploited by female “friends”. Like ya... let me do all the nice things that your boyfriend should be doing while I get absolutely nothing in return. And yes I don’t give a fuck. That means sex. Sorry. 

There is a very very obvious quid pro quo that goes on between the genders. Men are objectified as disposable tools of labor and providers. Women are exploited as sexual objects. It fucking sucks. It’s horrible. We all have taken gender studies. 

But for the life of me I still can’t understand this concept of why the fuck I would even talk to a female I’m not trying to fuck. And I don’t mean “oh we are friends on Facebook and we chat”. Or “no I have tons of online friends that I text and talk to!” No. I’m talking about friends you literally spend time with. Console. Nurture. Have deep meaningful conversations with. And if you do have that person then why aren’t you trying to be with them? A girlfriend should just be your best friend who also has a vagina. So if youre such great “friends” then fucking be together? Or else what’s the fucking point? So I can create my own sexual tension and get literally nothing I can’t already get out of a male companion???

And before I’m labeled the biggest douche on Reddit. It’s not like I haven’t had female friends. It’s not like I legit haven’t tried. But if I’m not trying to fuck them, then they are trying to fuck me. The moment you get into a relationship then they try to fuck your relationship up and fuck you. 

Fuck that shit. Enjoy that shit while you’re young and stupid. But when you become an actual adult it’s pretty obvious (considering the first comment) that the moment you actually enter a marriage, the opposite gender doesn’t want shit to do with you. Friendship or otherwise. 

I also love how men are treated like they’re the insecure ones. When it’s like... wait so you need constant male attention and that’s not insecure? You need to be constantly surrounded by men who want to fuck you in order to feel self worth? Again.... maybe I have a deeper concept of what “friendship” means. Because I certainly have co-workers, girlfriends of male friends I consider friends, women I do business with, pen pals across the country I keep in touch with, and plenty of female acquaintances that I interact with but never spend any meaningful quality time with. So what the fuck are these female friends? 

The concept of men and women being friends is either pointless at best, or more utopian than fully automated luxury gay space communism. And what’s even worse, it’s one of those things that we all know deep down inside but nobody will fuckin say. We all know what we’re trying to do. Our population didn’t get to be 8 billion by men and women being “friends” 🙄

I’ll take my downvotes. 

And of course I’ll be responded by tons of people (high schoolers) who will promise me they have tons of opposite sex friends. But i attest. If she ain’t fucking you then she’s working you. She’s getting something out of you that she wants and she ain’t giving you back what you want. That’s fucking exploitation on a literal level.",2021-04-06 02:45:15
mjxb5o,"My wife was friends with this guy in highschool and they never dated but they went to prom together a couple times. She said they kissed once but decided to just stay friends and she met me and told me everything about them. They were still friends and I was fine with it, I had met him plenty of times and I had no problem with him. One day my now wife, then fiance, came across her friend anniversary with him on Facebook so she tagged him with a heart and said something nice about being friends or whatever. Immediately after it was posted he called my wife and told her to take it down because his girlfriend didn't want to see another woman post a heart with him even though they were friends. We never heard from them again after that. We invited him to our wedding but we were never invited to his.🤷",2021-04-05 03:13:18

Even as far as to say they were interested at first but stopped being so when no moves were made and now they don't think of them that way anymore, sorry 🤷‍♀️

Toxic masculinity is composed of cultural concepts that aren't just believed in and propagated by men, women often play a large part as well. I'd actually say it couldn't exist to the degree it does without it being a group effort between genders to some extent.",2021-04-04 19:51:07

Business A makes product A.
Citizen buys product A.
Part of the purchase price was to cover the labor and expenditures to make product A.
Expenditures include shipping of parts and/or to final destination point over roads that are paid for by tax payers.
The more citizens buy product A the more the roads are used.
The less citizens buy product A the less the roads are used.
Company A doesn’t use the roads unless needed because of demand by citizens.
So…citizens who drive demand cause the increase of truck traffic directly on the roads.

Furthermore to clarify more on your previous post. Another reason businesses pay less is because local governments give them tax breaks to set up shop in their towns to give its citizens jobs. Otherwise towns dry up if there is no work.

He came armed to a riot and started instigating people. He was *seeking* violence, it was premeditated murder. We have around 74 million people in this country who believed Donald Trump should have had a second term,  I'm sorry but I find it hard to believe a jury of his peers would be impartial.

It got really hard when it was new housing developments with their own unique street names that weren’t on maps yet, huge apartment complexes, universities and businesses/office buildings.

One time I drove to a small college and wasted half an hour walking around the offices and different buildings, literally just asking people if they ordered a bunch of sandwiches, only to find out the order was for a different college with a similar name on the other side of town (person who took the order didn’t know both schools even existed).

pkw2st,"I used to be a pest control technician. I’d drive to houses and treat them for various pests, and worked both before and after GPS became popular. A few points about navigation pre-GPS:

1) you had a much better sense of direction because you had to. I would literally drive to a customer once, and be able to navigate back perfectly YEARS later. That ability is gone now, lol.

2) there were other navigation tools. People mention maps, and those were definitely a thing. So were atlases. I literally had a book for every area I serviced that had page after page after page of very detailed road maps. It also had a index at the back where you could look up a road and it would tell you what page that road was on, and where on the page.

3) driving is a lot more fast-paced today than it was back then. Like, people didn’t drive as fast, and people weren’t as aggressive or as quick to get angry. It wasn’t that odd to see someone pulled over on the side of the road studying a map to figure out where they were going. It also wasn’t that odd to stop and ask for directions.

I’ve never delivered pizzas, but if I was, and it was a pre-GPS world, I’d make sure I knew where that road was before I left. I also would have the delivery area memorized in a week, lol.

(Another thing that no one has mentioned is that delivery areas were smaller. It used to be like 2-3 miles, that’s it. Today I can order wings from a restaurant 10-12 miles away. It’ll take an hour to get there, of course. 🤣)",2021-09-09 14:43:31

our Store also had a giant gridded map in the back and the computer told us this delivery is B2 or whatever. This didn't really work well because the computer would say oh you can take a double for B2 and C2 disregarding the giant fucking lake in between.

You just have to know a few major ones to visualise an adress anyway.

I feel like people should generally be taught some semblance of etiquette for getting food delivered to their homes. You probably wouldn’t invite people over to your house and then hide out inside with all the lights off. It’s a bit rude.

I’ve also had so many people get shit delivered to stores and business addresses and not mention the name of the business they’re in, which seems like the absolute minimum amount of common courtesy and common sense if you’re getting food delivered to your work.

ie8mqp,"gotta hijack top comment to talk about wealth inequality- please just hear me out: 
 
Inequality in general is so much worse than most people realize and there's plenty of information that proves it. So, where to start?  
  
[The 400 richest Americans do, indeed, have enough liquid wealth to finance all of the USA's needed aid, ITS NOT TIED UP IN STOCKS](https://github.com/MKorostoff/1-pixel-wealth/blob/master/THE_PAPER_BILLIONAIRE.md)

[The ultra-rich are hoarding as much as $26-36 trillion ($26,000,000,000,000) in offshore accounts to avoid taxes.](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/panama/2016-04-12/taxing-tax-havens) 
  

Most people know that wealth inequality is a huge issue, but they don't understand just how bad it is. Here's an example: **If  you had a job that paid you $2,000 an hour, and you worked full time (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all  of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much money as Jeff Bezos.**


I've been researching this issue for years because I was shocked at just how bad it really is, and I've put together some information to help illustrate it.

ojdwcx,"That is only about the income tax though as you said. Apparently payroll taxes (OASDI taxes at least? Not from the states) for example are mostly taxed from the first 142k you earn. So in relation to total payroll the richer pay a tiiiny percentage compared to the working class. 

>This means the rich pay a far lower payroll tax rate than regular people. A nurse making a salary of $50,000 per year pays (counting both the employee and employer side) 12.4 percent in OASDI taxes (for Social Security and disability insurance). But a sitcom star making a thousand times that, or $50 million a year, will pay the 12.4 percent only on the initial $130,000 of their salary, working out to a total OASDI tax rate of just 0.03 percent on their $50 million. And because OASDI taxes are only levied on earned income — meaning, money you make from a job — a billionaire investor with a $50 million annual income from dividends and capital gains will pay exactly zero percent in OASDI taxes

If a corpo buya equipment, maintenance, furniture, vehicles, petrol.... whatever business expenses they have can usually be written off from taxation. 

When the brand and IP rights of the corporation are held in a shell in panama they can 0 their profit by billing their profit total to panama for said rights. 

It was pretty hard to find anything else on google about the %-share of taxes other than the income tax thing. A lot of think tanks speaking just about that in the results 🤔

Do individual states levy their own income tax? If so that is also missing from the 40% figure. 

The filthy rich of course can also just loan money against their assets to get tons of money outside of their income which is hidden from these stats too

E: the quote was from https://theintercept.com/2019/04/13/tax-day-taxes-statistics/ and used older number of 130k. Dont know aboit the reliability of the site itself but looking from https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/cbb.html the logic in the example seems to hold. 

>Thus, an individual with wages **equal to or larger** (emphasis mine) than $142,800 would contribute $8,853.60 to the OASDI program in 2021,",2021-07-13 15:41:31
ojdwcx,No I just work hard and don’t complain. Apparently that upsets people enough to start throwing insults at me🤷‍♂️,2021-07-13 16:10:18
ojdwcx,"A good start would be the payroll tax being made more progressive anf tiered higher than 140k. 

The loan thing is more about the fact that billionares dont have *that* much income income as it is but they can used their asset gains to still access liquid cash. They have a way to step over getting the income to straight having the cash in hand. 

I dont think it really helps the nuance either when the parties are for status quo or cutting tax for the top even more. Like Trump's tax cuts being permanent to the wealthy but being rolled back to same or even higher levels over the years for the working class. Absolute clownery 😂

Then the media, all the think tanks, and even as we now saw google results guiding and talking about such a narrow topic as *federal income tax* and ignoring everything else about the tax codes. Ignoring all the bits that have holes the size of semitruck in them. 

Saying billionares pay 0 taxes is more of a rhetorical tool in my eyes. If a billionare's taxes are in the permilles of their wealth its close enough to zero in relation to the wealth

I'd say the origin is IRS being underfunded. They dont have the funds to go after the people abusing the system and have to focus their resources to working class again",2021-07-13 16:23:41

You can have very specific guns with very specific licenses - like some farmers have single shot rifles for example but they have to keep the gun locked in a locker which is inspected annually. 99% of people in the country can’t legally own a gun. As a result there are a HANDFUL of shootings nationally each year. Like it’s so so rare. Idek like it’s so self explanatory 😂,2021-11-30 20:10:11

>Then why does everyone scream about gun laws instead of the things that would actually reduce violent crime? Even if you could magically disappear every gun in the country, you might save 30k people in a year -- but some of those deaths are going to happen anyway. Then next year there will be more guns because you can't stop the weapons trade. If you fixed those issues I listed then you could save 300k or more. But no, lets focus on gun laws and ensure that nothing will ever get fixed.

Hahahaha what? People talk about both all the time. This is a nonsense strawman. 

>So can you tell me, since you brought up Switzerland, do they have the same gun laws as the US?

>Irrelevant. 

Hahahahahahahahahaha so the country you brought up, in the context of gun laws, is now irrelevant? 😂

In Switzerland they have almost no gun violence and they have the same amount of guns per capita as the US. The reason why they have no gun violence is because they have insanely strict laws. Switzerland in fact some of the strictest gun laws in the world. You can’t just bring something up and then call it irrelevant once you realize that your argument is garbage 😂",2021-11-30 18:54:12

qbyl3c,"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.",2021-10-20 14:23:36

qbyl3c,"Sorry for the long post. Hope someone still reads lol

I know it seems like this on the surface, ""one less exorbitant bill..."" but this isn't how things breakdown. Healthcare is based off percentages and group input.

A very simple example: Fred has a plethora of medical issues and would stand to pay somewhere around $200,000 during his lifetime (completely made-up numbers). Bill is relatively healthy and would stand to pay 50,000 during his lifetime. So what healthcare tries to do is average out the costs so now Fred and Bill will both pay $125,000 during said lifetime.  Good for Fred but bad for Bill. Let's say Fred eats whatever he wants whenever he wants and doesn't exercise. That means that Fred would be paying for Bills unhealthy life choices. Not always the case obviously but I think it would be hard to argue that it would be the case very often in America. 

There would be a snowball effect: 1. The majority of health issues stem from improper diet and exercise. Considering America is one of the leading obese countries in the world you would have a lot of ppl paying for ppl that don't want to try and reduce costs associated with their healthcare. 2. A lot more ppl would go to clinics because it is free instead of tough out minor things etc. 3. More ppl going to clinics would then require more ppl to work in healthcare industry and increase costs per patient which would increase costs for healthcare. These are just basic things off top of my head that would go wrong. 

Your second point, service dog prices would go up because the trainers know they will be able to charge more for each since the govt is picking up the tab. The same was true for college tuition. Govt started giving loans to anyone who wanted one, you basically can't be denied. Once college caught in they started charging more and more because they knew that ppl would be able to take out loans for it no matter the cost.

All that said, I think the more randomly occuring things like cancer etc the population at large could pitch in to help because they aren't life choices that caused it. Even then how do you feel about lung cancer caused by smoking 3pks a day? The thing I'm trying to get across is that ppl should be held accountable for their own actions.

Your last point is that you'd like to try. I'm all for that in cities and states etc. Try it out and work out the kinks before something nation wide is implemented and we have another crisis in hand. BTW Bernie Sanders tried this in his state and it failed. Not saying all would fail but hat version did. Cheers 🍻🍻",2021-10-20 16:17:27

Chickenpox vaccine became available in the United States in 1995. 

Millions of doses of the vaccine have been given, and there is no evidence of any increased risk of developing a long-term health condition as a result of the vaccination.

There are no long term effects of this vaccine .  And there was never at any time 15% sterility.

13cqb4f,"I'm at the point where I'm so frustrated and angry that I have no hope that it'll ever get better. Our government won't do anything to stop mass shootings, no matter how many of us die and no matter how popular things like universal red flag laws and banning assault weapons are. Republicans won't allow any stricter gun laws because lobbying groups like the NRA pay them not to. They blame the problem on mental health but then they fight to cut the budget from government services that would help mentally ill people get treatment because helping them would be ""socialism"". Even if you believe what they say and think that stricter gun laws for some reason work in every country except America, how do people believe that they really care about the problem when they blame it on mental health and don't want to make mental health care more accessible either??? The only thing republicans are doing about mass shootings is fucking nothing. Anyone who votes for these people contributes to the needless killings whether they realize it not.

And it's even more frustrating to me because I'm close to finishing my degree in a government related field. The jobs I'm looking into require security clearances and the more I read about the process, the more pissed I am that we don't apply it to potential gun owners. They do a VERY thorough investigation on you. They investigate former and current friends, neighbors, employers, schools, coworkers, and landlords to figure out what kind of person you are before they decide that you're trustworthy to work for them. But buying a gun? The only requirements in my home state are being 18 and not having a criminal record yet (even though nobody has a criminal record until they, you know, commit a crime 🤦‍♀️ even mass shooters). They'd rather let someone harm another person and *then* decide they aren't allowed to own a gun after the damage is already done. The government already has a system in place to learn everything about a person but they just choose not to apply that to guns for some fucking reason. 

I'm so tired of trying to ""compromise"" on this. My life is more important than your fucking gun and if you disagree, I'm not going to respect your opinion anymore. You can go to hell.",2023-05-10 01:57:58

v8dx80,"I mean, you're wrong on so many levels. Pro choice advocates have made leaps and bounds in the past century. You do know that abortions weren't always medical procedures, performed by professionals right? 

My problem is that when a woman isn't able to support a child, the child often does not become a productive member of society. It can often pose a greater ethical and economic risk to force that woman to carry that pregnancy to term. 

I love that your only defence is ad homonym attacks on my position, rather than refuting what I've said. I am a learned professional, my field of work involves biology and chemistry. I have thought about these things more than most people 😂",2022-06-09 15:58:50

The majority of people campaigning against abortion want zero abortions to be performed ever. You'd be a fool to deny that. I don't believe in super late term abortions, but I also ultimately believe that we men should step back, and let women decide what their own freedoms should be.

My step siblings definitely take them for granted but I try to call them at least once a week and get lunch with them when I’m in town. 

Edit: Thanks for the silver! They are really amazing people. I hated grandparents day at school because I was usually the only one who didn’t have someone there. It was so upsetting to miss out on that relationship as a child so I cherish it now. For the record, my step siblings are good people and love their grandparents very much. They just grew up differently than I did so they don’t know what it’s like to not have grandparents.

Also this (him being a psychopath) would explain why he didn’t care how many people died of covid, and convinced his followers not to care…

Hey also who remembers the pee tape theory? Looking a lot more plausible now that he was selling secrets the whole time…

edit: does anyone have a list of all the things he ever accused everyone of? Biggest paper trail ever. I think I saw one on reddit one time

I kept extra feminine sanitary products in class so my female students wouldn’t have to waste time going to the nurses office for the cheapest most uncomfortable shit on the planet. Even had them in discreet makeup clutches to avoid embarrassment. 

But I suppose this bill has more to do with the mandatory puberty video we all had to watch in 5th grade. Regardless it’s dumb af. 

Honestly though, had I not left after Desantis won, I would have been fired long before this since I was an English teacher peddling woke literature like 1984 to my senior students 🙄. I always kept a large personal library in my classroom that got kids reading who hated reading because I would let them freely read anything they wanted on my shelf. 

I’ll never forget one of my kids who borrowed my Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy collection from my remedial classes. Her mom reached out to me a couple of years ago talking about how my class turned everything around for her daughter who went on to study Biology on scholarship. And my god looking back on my debate classes…. Those classes alone would have had me sued by snowflake parents because god forbid I allowed my students to speak their own opinions so long as they provided evidence to support them.  I have several former students who tell me every time they vote lol. The year I taught debate was the trump election year so they had many extra credit opportunities watching the debates and critiquing them based on what they learned in class. And of course we’d discuss portions of the debates in class. Could you imagine teaching a debate class in an election year and not being allowed to talk about politics because of the possibility that someone might say something that is considered woke??

Look, there’s a big difference between following proper decorum in the right place, at the right time, & then there’s this bullshit. 

Should young ladies run to the school auditorium during a talent show, & announce that they’re bleeding & need a tampon? Probably not. There are other ways of getting your legitimate needs met, even if discreetly. 

But what happens when a teenager really does need a tampon?

She cannot approach her teacher, a school staff member, a fellow student, & state her needs without the possibility of facing some sort of disciplinary action? Legal ramifications?

Fuck these bastards. This is all about shutting women up. It’s about shutting minorities up. It’s about shutting gay people up, about shutting lesbians up, about shutting trans up. 

Soon, they’ll be shutting up every single person who supports this lunacy and the lunatics leading the charge. 

You doubt me? Please do not. There are myriad examples of this same exact pattern & trajectory, over & over, throughout history. 

Maybe if these cunts read something other than their non sensical Bible, they’d have a clue. 

And the irony is, that their idol, Jesus, was murdered BECAUSE HE USED HIS FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AS A HUMAN BEING, AND SPOKE. 

He didn’t die for our sins. He died because he spoke up against a government that could not handle an ounce of free speech, the free exchange of ideas, or philosophical/ideological dissent.

When you do not stand for anything (REAL), you fall for anything.

Elon Musk should pay his taxes, but SpaceX is also not the company you should be bitching about where it comes to public taxes since I actually take very very very little I'm almost all of their capital comes privately, a large portion of it's coming directly out of Elon musk's pockets. Of course, he writes off all the money he spends, which is why he's Not paying taxes or getting poorer  despite dumping millions and millions into SpaceX.

SpaceX even paid for the lunar lander. It's ready and was ready before they paid them. They would have continued to do it even if they hadn't gotten paid. Unlike a certain other billionaire with rockets.",2021-10-27 16:01:47

Historically makes companies have taken the NASA approach AKA scientifically test everything before you even light it up and let alone put humans on it but SpaceX is of the opinion that it is quicker and safer to work out every possible kink physically rather than scientifically. He takes such huge amounts of risk but the reward for those risks is immense and the risks are fairly calculated. I mean we went from people believing it was literally impossible to belly flop a rocket to having done it perfectly after only a handful of launches ever in two years. In that same time. We have proved the feasibility of a full flow staged combustion engine using methane, though obviously still have some stability proving to go but raptor 2 hasn't misfired yet... I'm a big fan of the rapid development model.

You were given cups and pointed in the direction of the soda machine.  Ketchup dispenser next to the soda machine.  It was set up like a cafeteria line. I didn't see an employee working the drive thru, but there had to have been one. But it was super efficient and also super clean.  I don't recall seeing any indoor seating,  but I didn't look. We got our order and left. Not inviting at all. Definitely no playground.  I also noted that Panera was offering $16 (+) per hour and had open job interviews.

>But during my time on the other side, this was 100% the gameplan. They'd make ""sock puppets"" and coordinate on the board + IRC (showing my age here) to selectively choose targets to brigade.

>Depending on the target, you'd either have some talking points to ""debate"" (sometimes with yourself/other anons working alongside you) or you'd go in there guns blazing trying to cause as much damage/chaos as you can. However, even then you can't go out there yelling slurs (you'd just get banned instantly); you have to maintain some level of plausible deniability by framing things as ""jokes"" or thought experiments.

>You purposely do bad-faith arguments because the time it takes for them to dig up sources and refute you is longer than it takes for you to make stuff up. You can vary how obvious the bad faith argument is; when you want to troll you make very stupid claims (I once claimed I was a graduate of ""Harvad University"" and when people assumed that I meant ""Harvard"" I would correct them right down to Photoshopped images).

>When you just want to cause dissent you do exactly what those /pol/ screenshots do: you get to a thread early (sometimes you even make it yourself) and present reasonable-sounding arguments which are completely false if anyone bothers to look into them. If someone does, you bury the message under strawmen, downvotes, reports, and sockpuppets.

>The invincible ignorance fallacy[1] is a deductive fallacy of circularity where the person in question simply refuses to believe the argument, ignoring any evidence given. It is not so much a fallacious tactic in argument as it is a refusal to argue in the proper sense of the word, the method instead of being to either make assertions with no consideration of objections or to simply dismiss objections by calling them excuses, conjecture, etc. or saying that they are proof of nothing; all without actually demonstrating how the objection fit these terms

13rpdbc,"Oh yes, I love telling stories. Okay, you should know this about Christian school kids- wild, wild, wild. Some kids are kicked out of public school, some kids are just crazy, but pretty much every kid is repressed so they came from a really controlling home. My mom used to go through my room when I was at school and make sure I didn't have any CDs or tapes or music. She found my Dr. Dre CD and broke it and then when I got another one she broke it and grounded me for weeks, it was disheartening, she tried to take away music but I loved the beat so much. I fuckin hated Christian music. Most kids had home lives like mine, super repressed, mean parents, weren't allowed to do anything, etc.

So for every class of 20 students, 5 really loved Jesus. They wore crosses and memorized scripture and wanted to be a pastor or marry a pastor. 5 fuckin hated Jesus, wore black all the time, dark eyeshadow, painted their fingernails, drank vodka at lunch, you know the type. The other ten? They wanted to see something lit on fire. We had so many fires! We had a locker just for fires, we would just walk through and light that shit on fire like once a week. I remember the smoke alarms going off my last day there wading through three feet of trash in the hall when the police were handcuffing my friend Brian and taking him out, the black cop he goes incredulously, Man, the fuck is wrong with these kids? Ha!

On the day in question we went to the National Typewriter Museum. I know what you are thinking, what the fuck, they have a place in Kansas City thats just a museum for typewriters? No, they don't. They USED TO HAVE a place that was a museum for typewriters. We were terrible, knocking over trashcans, yelling, throwing shit, it was like someone had brought a bunch of monkeys out of their cages and let them go in a typewriter museum. And as soon as we got there 5 kids immediately crawled into cabinets and hid and pretended to be Anne Frank, the rest of us would go look for them and pretend to be Nazi soldiers, like I said we were terrible.

The teachers had had enough, they were fuckin pissed. This wasn't late in the afternoon, this was at like 11:30am. They said thats enough, all of you go get on the bus. Well all the Anne Frank kids are still hiding so they had to find those little fuckers meanwhile the rest of us were on the bus unsupervised going crazy, fuckin rockin that bus back and forth. I pulled the emergency brake and yep, sure enough, it started rolling down the hill. Paul, (very, very crazy guy, almost psychotic now that I think about it) jumped in front of the parking brake and stretched his arms across the front row and screamed YEAH WE ARE GOING DOWN TOGETHER! Not funny Paul we said as we tried to rush past but he wasn't joking either, he wanted us all to die together. The first two kids that rushed past he hit in the nuts as hard as he could. I felt responsible because it was me that pulled the brake so I hurtled my body at Paul but he blocked me and I went careening into the windshield. I looked back to the rear of the bus and people were jumping out the back scared. I forgot to say this but at this school but there was a strict dress code. The boys had to wear khakis and we lined up on Wednesday mornings before school to make sure our hair was not too long. Because we all know if there is anything Jesus hates its long hair and denim.

Also short skirts, I guess Jesus hates that. This was back when they still did corporal punishment and most of the girls I knew had been paddled for having skirts that were too short. Which, now that I think about it and knowing what a creep our headmaster is, taking girls in the back office alone to paddle them because their skirt was too short is so fuckin creepy. The last time I remember getting paddled was for blasphemy, my teacher was sick and queasy so when he prayed for lunch his voice cracked and he goes A-----meeeen. I jumped up in the back and yelled, A-----meeeen and he beat the shit out of me with a giant wooden paddle for blaspheming Gods Holy name.

So there I was crumpled up against the windshield from Paul's defensive blow watching the back door fly open and scared kids jumping out and rolling into the ditch. In that moment I remember it being beautiful though, a slow motion parachute jump with dresses flying in the wind amid the cacophony of sound.

Austin used my temporary diversion to get past Paul and pull the emergency brake up to everyone's relief but Pauls, that guy was definitely suicidal. We looked out the windshield, easy for me I was already right there crumpled up against it and saw that the nose of the bus was in the intersection of Paseo boulevard, one of the busiest street in downtown Kansas City. 

The teachers came running down that past all the kids in the ditch that had jumped and onto the bus full of what was left, all of us miscreants. We were all going to be suspended because we all took a vow of silence but somehow it got out that I was the one who pulled the emergency brake that day. I got suspended again (first time was for yelling at an opposing fan at a basketball game ""Shut up you penishead!"") and coupled with my older brothers suspensions (mostly from smoking) and my little brothers' suspensions (vodka in the water bottle) they asked our family not to come back to that Christian school, even though we were all good athletes and had helped our teams win conference championships. Enough was enough they said and that ended my parochial school education forever. I am banned from every campus of Liberty University but that was just on a visit, I never went to school there. From that moment on it was public schools for life!

vs4568,"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.",2022-07-05 21:20:19

Your comment can be applied in the opposite political direction, and to quite literally anything else that a parent has an extreme propensity for. Kids aren’t as stupid or as malleable as you might think. And not having a choice but to listen to someone — much like some people have no choice but to listen to and in some cases even agree with their bosses — doesn’t mean they actually buy or are susceptible to their bullshit. They just may not have a choice. Except kids can’t just find other parents the way some can “simply” find another job with another boss. It just looks like you’re trying to demean the kids for what is likely their parents’ poor judgement, which the kids can’t do a whole lot about, even if they disagree. If a kid feeling like they kinda have to listen to their parents over their schoolteacher is what constitutes cult-like behavior to you, then the cult of family should be far from the top of your mind when much bigger fish, like the cults of US political parties, the cults of religion, class, ideology, etc need to be fried.

You’re coming off as the kind of person who’d say that we should start watching the offsprings of all criminals because they’re probably going to be criminals too — by virtue of their parents being criminals: Both of John’s parents are extreme examples of tax cheats so John must probably believe that tax evasion is kosher too because taxation = theft. Because John totally lacks a mind of his own, and his brain is nothing but a photocopy of his parents’ brains. Cult of criminality, right? 🙄",2021-08-15 16:32:16

After a while, I had the most seniority, so I got to choose which side of the dorm I wanted to clean, women or men.  I personally preferred cleaning the men’s side. 

Women’s bathrooms are consistently icky. Not horrible, or super gross, but there will always be more hair and there will always be those little period product receptacles.  Wiping up hair is a pain in the ass, and used period products that have been sitting for a day have a very unique smell. 

Men’s bathrooms weren’t that bad. Wiping down a toilet and sink was about the same as on the women’s side, but less long hairs. But what the men’s side that the women’s never seems to have was occasional messes of mass destruction.  A lot more vomit from the folks who didn’t make it to the toilet. Gross food poured into the bathroom sink with a drain it obviously wouldn’t go down. Literal shit in the shower because…?  I got to wear a lot of hazmat suits, lmao!

I've been attacked 3 times in my life. Each time NO ONE was around, & it happens so fast there's no chance to yell security if I could have. None were in a restroom.

Edit: I honestly can't believe this is my most popular comment ever when just below this on another comment I started a Boromir/LOTR thread 😭😭

But I'm so sorry so many of you have experienced this kinda shit at the hands of organised religion, I can't begin to imagine the trauma some of things have caused you all.
But for everyone else: please remember that individuals are not the enemy. Having religion and believing in something bigger than them is not a flaw or something to be shamed about.

The shame should be directed towards *organised* religion and the commercialised versions of each type of religious preaching, and the people who use others as a way to further their own convictions to gain power and wealth.

Individuals who have fallen into congregations and indoctrinated into cults to ostracise and shame others like so many have mentioned on this thread are victims too, they just don't see it that way-

EDIT: Some people have forgotten their Constitutional Amendments.

Amendment 19 (women): *The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.
Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.*

This is only implicitly granting a right to vote to women. Explicitly it says that if your law denying the vote singles out a group of people defined by their sex, then the law is unconstitutional. If it manages to define a group of people which happens to include women without explicitly singling out women to lose their votes, the women in that group lose their ability to vote.

Contrast this with the First Amendment. A law denying freedom of speech to anyone falls afoul of the Explicit Constitutional Right To Freedom of Speech. Freedom of Speech has explicit Constitutional language. **There is no explicit Constitutional right to vote like there is for Freedom of Speech.**",2023-02-22 06:40:28

118ebk6,">This looks pretty explicit to me. You’re just trying too hard to find a way to say “there is no explicit right to vote in the Constitution.” That’s just BS. 

Look, it's very simple: the US Constitution doesn't contain explicit protection for the right to vote like it contains the explicit language protecting the rights to freedom of expression, right to a jury trial, and so forth.

You are trying to say that laws which limit the restrictions that a state can place on voting constitute guarantees of voting rights for the affected parties, when the explicit language doesn't say anything of the sort. 

Actual text of the 15th Amendment says states can limit voting rights, just not for the specified classes of persons:

>The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

Actual text of the 19th Amendment says states can limit voting rights, just not for the specified classes of persons:

>The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

Actual text requires a limit placed on the power of states to deny the vote to specific classes of people because they had the Constitutional power to do so. Note this power in the fact that black men gained the right to vote but black women did not, and had to wait for the 19th Amendment like all the white women.

The problem with your 9th Amendment argument is that voting is clearly laid down as something state governments control in Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the US Constitution.

https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S4-C1-2/ALDE_00013577/

This section of the Constitution is *why* the 14th, 15th, 19th Amendments to the Constitution had to be written. Until the passage of the 14th Amendment, the US Constitution generally did not apply to the state and local governments. This resulted in cases wherein states that did not have freedom of speech in their own state constitutions and could arrest people for expressing insults to *state* governments.

The 9th Amendment only covers areas not explicitly stated in the US Constitution, and the US Constitution says that states, not the federal government, define voting rights. This has been upheld by courts for centuries, and an expansive reading of Art1Sec4C1 has been the standard upheld by the courts.

9th Amendment:
>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

The US Constitution enumerates the right of figuring out who votes and who does not in Article I, Section 4, Clause 1. The right to vote is thus not one another right retained by the people, because it's already excluded by the first half of the 9th Amendment.

>But there are three sentences that say “the right to do X cannot be limited by Y.”

And if there was an explicit Constitutional right to vote, *the act of limiting the right to vote wouldn't have been allowed in the first place.* But there had to be Constitutional Amendments limiting the state government powers as laid down in Article I, Section 4, Clause 1, because states get to define who gets the right to vote.

I don't know how to be any more explicit: states get to define who has the right to vote; prior to the Amendments limiting the state governments' right to do this, they could easily decide not to allow women to vote, black men to vote, etc. because the US Constitution gave them that power; and because the state power to define who gets the right to vote is defined in the US Constitution, the 9th Amendment doesn't apply.

>Ben Franklin even pointed out that by creating an enumerated Bill of Rights, there would be fools who would later do what you are trying to do - argue that it was an exclusive and exhaustive list. Which it is not. 

Unfortunately for your argument, state governments, as enumerated in Article I, Section 4, Clause 1, are empowered by the US Constitution to define who gets to vote. The Clause stipulates that the US Congress can change this as needed, such as with the 14th, 15th, and 19th Amendments, but until they specify the change, state governments can decide that a person doesn't have the right to vote. Even Ben Franklin would agree that what is in the US Constitution is in the US Constitution.

People really need to read their Constitution more often, instead of reading the Cliffs Notes version. There's a lot of law in that document many people don't realize is in there, and a lot of law many people mistakenly think is in the Constitution when it is not.

The right to travel, for example. There's no explicit right to travel in the US Constitution. It only exists because of a Supreme Court precedent from _. The current Supreme Court has shown little regard for past precedent, so the right to travel could be on the chopping block for, say, Democrats moving into Red States. 🤔",2023-02-22 21:58:19

118ebk6,">Explicit doesn’t mean the same thing as enumerated and you are mixing those concepts up (either obtusely or unknowingly). 

I have no idea which legal dictionary you have that declares that enumerated isn't explicit.  You should sue. Enumerated in the Constitution is explicitly written therein. If it is not in the US Constitution, then it is explicitly written in the Supreme Court precedent, but not enumerated in the US Constitution. Enumerated means there's a number for it, like Article I, Section 4, Clause 1. Look, there's the place it is explicitly written.

>The amendments as they are written right now make it explicit that voting is a right (one that can be limited).

No, it can be denied outright because it isn't explicitly enumerated in the US Constitution. Those Amendments exist precisely because the right to vote is not explicitly enumerated in the US Constitution. States don't get to decide that a prisoner lacks his Explicit Constitutional Right To Freedom of Speech. They can deny them the right to vote, as per ArtISec4Cl1 allowing them to do just that. They tried 9th Amendment too, and failed, because there is no fundamental right to vote in the US Constitution.

>You’re actually arguing that the “Right to Vote” wasn’t enumerated in the original Bill of Rights. Which is true. 

Never said that, though this explains your argument style a great deal. Look up ""strawman"" sometime.

>But you’re trying to then say that your argument therefore means it is not explicitly in the Constitution now. Which is not accurate.

What is accurate is that states have had their power to deny Americans the right to vote, as noted in Article I Section 4 Clause 1, explicitly limited by some Amendments to the US Constitution.

**There is no right stated in the US Constitution that anyone has the right to vote.** There are reasons states cannot deny you the right to vote, but because it isn't explicitly protected, or even enumerated if we must continue with your legal fiction, states can deny felons the right to vote. Because states can deny the right to vote. Because the Constitution specifically says they can define who votes, subject to certain limitations.

>As is the right to travel. It’s called the “commerce clause,”

Sigh.

The Commerce Clause, Article I, Section 8
>The Congress shall have Power To...To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;

That's it. Congress can regulate it. No mention of a right to travel.

As for the actual right of travel, there are three versions, and the one American citizens need isn't in the US Constitution. 

>The doctrine of the right to travel actually encompasses three separate rights, of which two have been notable for the uncertainty of their textual support. The first is the right of a citizen to move freely between states, a right venerable for its longevity, but still lacking a clear doctrinal basis.

There's a Supreme Court precedent for the first one. No law or text in the Constitution though. Travel between states isn't automatically commerce.

>The second, expressly addressed by the first sentence of Article IV, provides a citizen of one state who is temporarily visiting another state the Privileges and Immunities of a citizen of the latter state.2 The third is the right of a new arrival to a state, who establishes citizenship in that state, to enjoy the same rights and benefits as other state citizens. 

This is all Fourteenth Amendment stuff, again not The Commerce Clause. Commerce Clause is used in subsequent Supreme Court precedent to create the right to travel between states, as well as the Fifth Amendment, but at the time the Commerce Clause was written, it was not a right to travel between states.

Supreme Court precedent declaring right to travel a fundamental right, like abortion is part of our fundamental rights.

The only thing we did really push on was the hole in the ozone layer. Removing CFCs from refrigerators, spray cans, etc... Just imagine if we'd gone all in on the rest. I don't think that Gen-X in general is *actively* evil, but we've definitely been the people sat on the sidelines playing with our Walkman and waiting for another straight line on Game Boy Tetris. 4 lines gone! 🎉🎊🎈

Although I do need to remind folks that MTG, Kevin McCarthy, and (I just found out that I'm the exact same age to the day as) Rhonda Sandtits are all Gen-X. And for my fellow Brits, Richie Sunak, Cruella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Liz Truss, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, Matt Hancock.

It's hard trying to make it through, and the more the roulette of life spins, the more it feels like we're being crushed. Honestly I got lucky that I've only got epilepsy and some joint problems, it could always be worse. 

Factory work is both some of the most cursed, yet best work for hard living situations and circumstances, but at 30 I already feel the heavy affects of the life. But we stay the course right? Try to find our own way and do things better for the best chapter of life. Especially after having bad examples and failures as the people that brought us into this world.

If someone told you that you had to hide your appearance then they were just scared or upset about the sight of it. People tend to be scared of what they don’t understand. That’s your god given right to do what you want to with your body. It’s in the amendments. You have freedom of speech. Freedom to do as you please as long as it upholds the law and nobody gets hurt. Fuck the hat everybody else in the world thinks. You do you. You be the best you you can be and with that being said this world is ours. We might think it belongs to the people who have power and money but look around you. The money we hold so near and dear is fading away. The value of it is trash now. The power these people have obtained won’t last very much longer. There are WAY more of the people than there are the government. You really honestly think the people that are in the army are gonna side with the government when shit hits the fan rather than help their loved ones who aren’t in the government? I don’t think so. The government is just stepping stones away from falling apart with all sides going against each other. Pretty soon we might be at war with another country. Have you ever wondered why other countries HATE Americans? Because we always go sticking our fat noses where they don’t belong. I’ve heard people say the government will be our demise and blah blah blah but the reality of it is that humanity itself will be the demise of humanity. Alls we do on a daily basis is tear the world apart. Destroy our atmosphere. Pollute everything we touch. Manipulate everyone we come near. Humans are scum. It’s in our nature. Not all of us but a big damn percentage of us are. Thanos said it perfectly. The world is unbalanced. It’s resources finite. It’s food finite and without correction we will fall. There’s ALOT more to movies and comics and documentaries than we let on to be. People put messages and warnings in all kinds of literature that we just faintly flick away and despise and think 🤔 our government would never let that happen. A good example of how our government is is the movie don’t look up with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence. If you haven’t seen it, please by all means go watch it. It basically shows that in times of crisis our government tries to find ways to use the crisis to their advantage and their own personal gain and fuck the people. I might get a lot of down votes for this but the shits true. The government could give two fucks about us people as long as they’re put on a pedestal like they always have been.

The specific point you made that was trash and invalidated.yoir argument. You know, the one where you try to invalidate future responses like a typical bad faith argument. But I'll address's some.of the stupid responses you just made if you want.  
\>But country to country comparison says it's cheaper to live in Norway and Sweden- both democratic auxiliary countries with fairly extreme liberal policies and laws  
And it's also cheaper to live in China, don't make it better. Also cheaper to live in Cuba, Venezuela, Russia, North Korea, I can go on and on with countries more socialist and ""liberal"" than Norway and Sweden just to prove cheaper ain't better.  
\>The point being made is that this is not a blue issue, it's a united states issue. An issue that's been solved elsewhere in the world.  
Not in the countries I mentioned. Just in those homogeneous countries like the 99% White Nordic ones you love. So, let's just boot all the non white people out?  
\>I don't even know what this means on a conservation about (checks notes) blue areas being over expensive and living like a king in red areas with a moderate income.  
But you've made this about countries compared to other countries, so why do you now focused on the Original topic? Oh, right. You wanna deflect and shift the topoc, then project that idiocy onto someone else, because you argue in bad faith. You could have stayed on topic about red vs blue states if you wanted, but you don't want to. You don't want to give actual arguments and contribute to the conversation, you want to complain about the US and whine that we aren't an all white European nation. Not a helpful way to solve this ""United States"" problem.  
\>No, it's not. Maybe you feel it is, and it's okay to get your feelings hurt. But country to country comparison says it's cheaper to live in Norway and Sweden- both democratic auxiliary countries with fairly extreme liberal policies and laws.  
If it's not, why you up in arms because I started making country to country comparisons, trying to imply they are illogical? I know why... Because you argue in bad faith. ""Country to country comparisons are logical."" ""Why are you comparing a country in a conversation about US states? Not logical"".  
\>If you were comparing COL in Japan vs Norway (and Japan, after a cursory search, is cheaper), you may have an argument, but you brought up teenage girl's panties.  
I believe I did. I'm quite sure i stated Japan was cheaper, but I could be wrong as I can't see my comment. Also, references to Japans unique culture being important because a countries culture, as well as it's history, playing a crucial role in it's politics, cost of living, and quality of life, definitely went right by you. ""US needs to do like Norway because they are cheaper and therefore better, their all white socialist liberal culture and politics is far superior. Has nothing to do with the way nation developed over time and what social values it's people have come to adopt to get there.  
\>The socialism boogeyman is why  
Another irrelevancy. Bring up an opposing argument no one made, or at least yet, so you can invalidate opposing arguments without having to actually argue against them. More poisoning the well arguments. Textbook Bad faith.  
\>Next question, is Japan more, less, or equally as liberal as Norway and Sweden?  
""Liberal"" not being properly used here. Do you know what Liberalism is? It doesn't mean Socialist? Liberalism is a 17 century French sociopolitical system that stood for individualism, prosperity and removing power from authority back to the populous. It was created during the Enlightenment Age. Ever heard of it? It sparked John Locke's ""Natural Rights"" philosophy, which was the foundation for the US structuring it's government and political system. It helped give birth to arguably the greatest form of free market system in history. The same free market system that your precious Norway and Sweden adopted to help fund their Socialist policies. Ironic.... Nothing you stated this far in reference to ""liberal"" has been true, just like you claiming to be making logical, valid arguments in a thread about US states when all you are arguing is how other countries are better because ""cheaper"".   
\>If they need help, we'll throw a bunch of money to contractors.  
What, all of like 2 million? 📷 I'm sure Boeing or Lockheed would just cry with enjoyment from whatever your country could scrounge up. Your country, with an economy smaller than 15 of our states? Your money couldn't cover food stamps for a state.   
\>Again what does that have to do with the COL in blue areas.  
As much as you bringing up Norway in the first place: nothing. 📷 You are laughably incompetent with this. ""I'ma bring up a whole other country that is not relevant to the discussion to argue completely off topic how my country and all the other White countries by me are better than you because we have no people of color here. Like maybe 5, but we whip them into obedience.""  
""Why are you bringing up these non white countries to argue against my White countries? That makes no sense, it has nothing to do with CoL of Blue States! Here's an improper usage of the Liberal because I'm better than you because I'm a White Scandinavian dude and we are the superior humans.""   
I'm not arguing against a fool who deflects to a non sequitur and tries to discredit any future opposing arguments, then gripes about a counter argument to his straw man with how it doesn't have anything to do with the original topic he moved from.... I am mocking the fool. The fool is you, in case you weren't aware. Your country didn't solve anything, Norway is still economically Capitalistic. You're entire economy is not only dependent on an economic system We created for you, but also, you're also entirely dependent on US both in how well our economy is doing AND us being big ass bullies and keeping oppressive regimes like Russia and China away from the West. Your country is no better really than one of the small blue states or the red ones. You're like Kansas. It's laughable to think you are in anyway better than the US.  
Yes, what works for Norway won't work for the US. It's a simple statement. Just like parenting in one home won't work in Every homes, and how no one business model works for Every business. We are just Culturally different. We like things in Excess, we are not as community oriented, we are a far greedier nation all around. We have numerous demographics with entire cultures that differ from region to region. Even amongst blue states, California as a whole is functionally, economically, socially and culturally different then New York. They eat different foods, live different lifestyles, have different values. There is No Such Thing as homogenous here. We have more communities and cultures and ancestry than all of Europe as one country. Your country doesn't. You're all one type of people, raised to value one set of social values and political policies. just like in most of the Nordic countries, and much of Asia. You've had a millenia to build one tiny nation and work out all issues, and yet you still had Anders Breivik. Guess y'all aren't all that perfect as you thought. Still got a lot of issues. 📷📷📷📷 you know, you Could focus on Norway, making it better both technologically and economically so you're not vastly outpaced by a little island that suffers from tsunamis and an oil despot that enslaves Africans in forced labor contracts. That's a reference to Japan and Qatar; Japan be exponentially technically superior and Qatar being vastly more wealthy in all aspects. Or you can keep acting like you have some important Anti US philosophically groundbreaking argument that will revolutionize the biggest, baddest, richest, most powerful nation in Human history so we could be like Your tiny, imputent, broke, backwoods country that's not really known for anything except the fairytales of a bunch of savage tribals and their otherworldly wizard warriors. Hell, at least Sweden is rumored to have the best looking women on Scandinavia. Later, child.
