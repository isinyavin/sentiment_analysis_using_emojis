All I see on Twitter, news media, or any other social media are talking heads that support Trump and the insurrectionists, people fanning the flames of arguments, and little to no rational thought. What happened to logic? Thank you to each of you who showed it in your comments. It gives me hope for our country. We may not agree on everything, but this, this I can work with.

l1fxyh,"Yes, please conservatives reclaim your party from these Q wackos! As a pretty left leaning liberal, I'm very saddened to see what's happened in the Republican party. More like seriously concerned actually. Not that I've ever been a fan of Republicans, but that was mostly because of policy and ideological differences. I enjoyed having reasonable, rational discussions with my right leaning friends about politics. Sure there might be some name calling thrown around occasionally by both sides, but at least I felt I could talk to a Republican leaning person and see where they would be coming from with their views. 

But this Q Anon conspiracy crap I just can't deal with. Even if it results in Republicans losing support from middle of the road, non partisan types and helps the party I tend to support win elections. Because I know we're always going to have conservatives with us, we should have a strong opposition party to keep both parties in check. Neither party can expect to win every election for the rest of time, and its reasonable to assume that we will eventually have a Republican president. And one party rule always breeds corruption and erodes democratic freedoms no matter which one has the power. 

However, we can't run a country if one of the party's loses its grip on reality and becomes a party that has no logical basis for its policies and positions. If one party becomes one of cult-like conspiracy-laden people who are so far down the Q rabbit hole that they can't be reasoned with, even along conservative leaning people,then we can't function as a country. It's not healthy for a democracy when one side can't agree with objective facts, like something so simple as water being wet. 

I tend to think that most of these Q Anon type Trump supporters aren't really conservatives, they're mostly people who were apolitical and aren't quite educated much about how government works and how basic democratic functions work. Many aren't even in favor of democracy. That's not a great sign that our political discourse is so far gone, that people believe in the wildest things. 

I'm not trying to come off as insulting conservatives. I have lots of Republican friends who are reasonable. I'm not talking about coming to an agreement about tax policy, or universal health care, or the merits of social welfare programs. I'm talking about people believing in crazy, insane stuff like politicians are literally eating babies and that the earth really could be flat. They're outlandish, batshit theories aren't just about Democrats, liberals, or Hollywood either. They think this about Republicans too. They're literally trying to destroy the Republican party from within. And its not from a place of good faith. Its terrifying that these people are winning elections. 

I can deal with generic Republicans as much as they are a thorn on my party's side. But if y'all start electing these Q Anon types to represent you guys, not only will you guys lose most of America who hasn't been sucked in by the cult, and thus national elections, y'all might not have a party left period. Maybe consider joining the Libertarians or something, but whatever this Q Anon movement is, it sure ain't conservative and its not healthy for Republicans or for this country. Conservatives believe in object reality, down to earth, rationalism. It's part of what makes them conservative. Some of the greatest thinkers of our time considered themselves conservative. This...this ain't it though. Please reclaim your party from these wackjobs. We're begging you, for the good of the country. 🇺🇲",2021-01-22 00:35:21

But I don’t think that’s gonna happen. 

Trump is basically a messianic figure in all of this. He is the savior of the death cult of whiteness. Whiteness itself requires an acceptance of so much cognitive dissonance to buy into it, so I don’t think his failure will end this movement. Last time a fervent cult’s savior failed to become the messiah that was promised to liberate them, they didn’t all abandon him.

Do you really want to start with the Trump isn’t racist nonsense? The man ran on fearmongering about Mexicans raping and murdering Americans and Muslims trying to wipe us off the map.

Also that's real funny the klan has switched their party affiliation to democrat and endorsed joe biden. Probably because the democrats have done far more destructive things to black lives than republicans could even think of. Again, you won't list anything. I'd bet money on it.

jnxgm3,"Well where do we start? The media has spent 4+ straight years trying to set Trump up, disregard his accomplishments and tell everybody he is a dictator.. Then we get told by the same people how to think, what to say 24/7 in news, movies, sports and online media. At some point you reach a breaking point and say no more, enough.

As far as policy goes, the Democratic party has drifted too far left on virtually every issue and it is too much to stomach - this is a constitutional republic, we are not mini Europe.

**Edit:**
Thanks for flair and upvotes. For the record, people are asking me if I’ve even lived in Europe - yes I have I’m from Sweden and I pick USA 🇺🇸 over living in any other country in the world.

A ton of unflaired users have written replies to me that Im able to see momentarily but they are auto removed since this post is locked to flaired users only. 

I understand why its locked, and most people who have come to this sub due to feeling the bias of /r/politics/ probably value free speech, as I do myself. It is what it is, this sub is getting brigaded a lot, but I thought Id break down some of the replies I have received and let other people answer, in case any of you non conservatives are interested to hear out a different perspective.

**- But Trump IS a fascist, he doesn't want to count the polls**  
**- I live in Europe, what is wrong with Europe?**  
**- Biden is a centrist, what is wrong with him?**  
**- Why do you consider Democratic party drifting left?**",2020-11-04 14:27:42

Not only has Biden voted in support of some questionable things, but he has promised to violate our 2A rights even further, has promised to take AR15s away, etc etc. Not to mention all the gaffes and idiotic things he's said. I really don't see how he could be considered any better than Trump. Like someone else said in this thread, I employ the president, I don't have to like him, I just want results. And look at what Trump did for our economy? Look at how he yanked us out of wars that we had no business being in. Where is ISIS? They were a headache the entirety of Obama's presidency, Trump gets into office, and bam, they're no longer a glaring threat to international safety. Our economy soared before COVID, unemployment tanked, and most notably, the Hispanic and Black community had the lowest unemployment rate EVER, under the guidance of a man everybody calls racist. Ironic🙄. Do I think he shits rainbows, and the sun rises and sets on his every whim? No, he's a complete ass sometimes, and shoots himself in the foot ALL THE TIME in regards to PR, but damn he's a good president. And this new, SJW, progressive agenda that the DNC has been pushing, is radical at best, straight fascism at worst.

My comment primarily talks about the press, I'd imagine if her differential treatment was  because people thought meghan was obnoxious she'd have her bad traits/actions highlighted. Whereas what actually happens is that Kate and Meghan are doing almost the exact same thing yet the headline would be deragtory for meghan.

Like look at this headline about them eating avocados😂

we shld know this by now.  

btw, the bbc always says “without evidence.” im not sure what theyd accept as evidence of electoral fraud aside from all those who have been caught already 🤷‍♂️

i, for one, am GLAD he thinks out loud.  most transparent potus ever, it shows his confidence that he wont lose even if ppl react strongly to what he says, and it generally encourages the 1st amemdment.

jpc1xn,"Depends on level of resources and type of ballot being counted.  In PA for example, they were not allowed to open or begin processing mail-in ballots before the election.   It took a takes longer to process a mail-in ballot due to the verification process, which includes checking the signature on the ballot against the voters signature before it’s counted.  So the initial ballots counted in PA were Election Day ballots, which were quick and easy to count.   Then they had to count the mail-in ballots which took much longer.  

Other states like Ohio and Florida avoided this because state law permits them to begin processing mail-in ballots before Election Day.  The Republican legislature in Pennsylvania refused to permit the early processing of ballots however.  

This is also why some states started off as blue then shifted red (Ohio and North Carolina), while others started red and shifted blue (Pennsylvania and Georgia).  It all boils down to when the mail-in ballots were counted.  

Ohio and North Carolina counted mail-in early, and these favored Democrats.  So it looked like the Democrats were winning when in reality they just counted the Democratic leaning votes first.  The same happened in Pennsylvania and Georgia, but in reverse.  They counted Election Day ballots first, which heavily favored Republicans.  Then they started counted mail-in ballots which heavily favored Democrats.  

Hope that helps. 😀",2020-11-07 17:17:27

1. Russia Invades Ukraine! If Trump was still president he would have flown over to Moscow in Air Force 1 and delivered such a brutal MMA-style beat down that Putin would have to beg for forgiveness while tears streamed down his face. That's why he never invaded while Trump was in office, he was afraid of the Octagon.



2. Gas prices went up and then down again! I can't even barely afford to fill up my Escalade. It's so bad that I had to buy a bunch of ""I did that!"" stickers and put them up on gas pumps all over town. 



3. Inflation! Why does the free market not always work 100% in my favor? If anything, prices should always be going down, not up. My children are literally starving. We have reduced Chik-fil-A rations to thrice a week.



4. Biden shook hands with nobody! This is the worst offense to date. Truly, truly horrifying. If he's trying to interact with ghosts on stage, in broad daylight, just image the terrible occult-like stuff he's probably (and by probably, I mean most definitely) doing in private.",2022-10-07 11:04:53

However, when a moderator removes a comment during a discussion with respect to a political issue when that commenter is being viciously attacked and disrespected, yet the moderator removes none of those comments, it reveals the apparent bias- the moderator unjustly removed the comment because they sided with the aggressors instead of remaining neutral and objective and removing all of the inappropriate comments altogether. Althouh my original comment may be perceived as being general, I'm referring specifically to those moderators who blantantly commit such acts. I would never make such an irrational statement as to say all moderators are libturds.

gto8ul,"Black men might kill whites at 50 times the rate, but what you conveniently ignore is this (protests, riots, Flloyd) isn’t about a black man getting tourtured lynched and murdered again for no reason in broad daylight. That’s just business as usual for morally underdeveloped countries, the outrage is the perpetual reaction to the execution of these innocent men...

Your observation would only make sense and not be a dishonest paralellel if it were factually correct “black men kill white people ate 50 times the rate and they get to do it with immunity too”... like how these dickless cops get to beat kill and tourture people... people whom are disproportionately black being abused by cops who are disproportionately not black, while not suffering any real world consequences. 

Blacks don’t get to kill whites with immunity the same way. They just don’t. They get put in jail if they are guilty. They even get sent to jail if they are innocent. Hell I bet you guys have more innocent people in jail than guilty ones.

mdtgm9,"That’s great! I wasn’t asking you to verify it for me, I was just noting that these kinds of tabloids get people talking more about the source than the topic. Folks on the left (a lot of them anyway) would immediately discredit it because it’s a tabloid. It would be nice if liberals didn’t ask conservatives to provide 8 million sources (as if you owe them that)! And you definitely don’t have to do any research for me, I just like to note about the Daily Mail when I see it. This is actually the second article I’ve seen in the last few hours from the Daily Mail! People will shit all over the source instead of using their thinking muscles and put together a thought. Spending more time to complain about the source than focusing on its topic seems like a cheap way to avoid a conversation and/or learning experience. 🤦‍♀️ 

From what I’ve noticed in this sub though, it’s been better received than other subs I’ve been in. 🤷‍♀️🙂

I was replying in reference to your comment about people saying you were spreading misinformation. I always think those people just look at the source of the topic & immediately dismiss it. And then when (if (anything is possible)) they realize they were wrong and are expected to put-up or shut-up, they backtrack to distract from the fact that they didn’t do anything research or thinking for themselves.",2021-03-26 22:59:11
mdtgm9,"I consider myself a far left liberal (my husband says I’m not far left though) and my biggest pet peeve is anyone believing anything they read just because one source says it. And then they argue about the source credibility longer than it would take to just keep reading from a few other sources. Or just sit back, relax, decide how they feel & think & question about the topic.    

Less tabloids & satire would be phenomenal because not enough people take the time to even check the source of something they agree with. We see it all the time-politicians & newscasters alike post stuff from Babylon Bee or The Onion! And those are people we expect to know better. 🤦‍♀️",2021-03-26 22:29:32
