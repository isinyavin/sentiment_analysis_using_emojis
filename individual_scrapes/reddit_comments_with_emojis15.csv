It is made using:
*Potassium chloride from mining ancient dried lakes.
*calcium from mining (formed from living creatures that have died. Your eating animals)
*iron from mining
*cocoa butter (2.3 million child slaves used in industry)
*coconut oil 82% saturated fat
*methylcellulose a semi synthetic agent that causes diarrhea and is completely indigestible by humans.

So to clarify: it uses various plants and beans which require room to grow and various synthetic herbicides, mines for the vitamins and minerals which create lots of co2 emissions and require vast land destruction, child slavery to harvest and process ingredients and synthetic non digestible laxatives to hold it all together.

1) Trending the number of self-employed/single owner-operator businesses, contractors and gig workers against this. I think it would highlight how vulnerable the U.S. has made itself with this increasing trend.

2) Trending small businesses against this for same reasons as above.

3) Trending the numbers of U.S. large businesses/employers against this.

4) Trending uninsured and self-insured against this.

5) Trending large businesses or # of jobs that left the U.S. against this.

fj7535,"I would say the weather in India and Indians familiarity with fighting other viral outbreaks is helping. Reposting from Facebook below. Didn’t fact check everything but seems correct in the ballpark from anecdotes from friends and family in the country. 


India has dealt with the threat of COVID-19 with far greater tenacity and firmness than ALMOST ALL countries.👇

1. Firstly, despite sharing a border of 3,488 kilometres with China, India has only reported 78 cases and 1 death- compare that with 596 cases and 8 deaths in the UK.

2. India is the only country in the world to evacuate its citizens 6 times (and counting) and evacuated the most number of foreign nationals. 

3. The Indian Air Force evacuated a total of 723 Indians, 37 foreign nationals from Wuhan. India evacuated 119 Indians and 5 foreign nationals from Japan. IAF also evacuated 58 Indian pilgrims from Iran on the 10th of March. Total: 900 Indians and 48 foreign nationals.

4. India is leading the fight against COVID-19 in the South Asian region, offering diplomatic, humanitarian and medical assistance to its neighbours.

5. A total of 56 Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) have been set up in India to test its citizens as well as foreign citizens in a record time, with a plan to build 56 more VRDLs in the next month. 

6. India currently has one of the world’s most efficient and reliable testing systems, reducing the time taken to get test results back from 12-14 hours to four hours. 

7. Iran, Afghanistan  and countries in Asia have been requesting India to help set up testing facilities in their countries.

8. India has provided 15 tonnes of medical assistance comprising masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment to China.

9. India has screened 1,057,506 people from 30 airports and 77 seaports.

10. India has suspended all visas to India. The Indian nationals coming from COVID-19 hit nations after 15 February will be quarantined for 14 days. 

11. India has the world’s largest Federal Government -sponsored health insurance, covering over 500 million people  (approximately 8 times the size of the UK).

12. Indian drug prices are among the cheapest in the world. 

13. China had silenced the doctor who identified COVID-19 and he died 6 weeks later. China let this brew. On the other hand, when Nipah virus was found in India in 2018, 3 doctors identified it and authorities immediately reported it to WHO. 2000 quarantined and 17 died in total. India would have NEVER allowed it to become a pandemic.",2020-03-16 04:35:01

fj7535,"Twitter was your source for criticism?! Well that sounds reliable and reputable to me 🙄 You say critics and I’m looking for Wapo and NYT screeds, but you’ve got Tweets by god! Closing travel from Europe is a joke because it doesn’t stop the virus from getting here when it’s already here. He makes it out to be a grand gesture to stop this when in fact it’s here and the only reason why no one has freaked to this point is because we have no test kits to find it. Perhaps had he done that a month ago it would’ve been a bold lean forward move, assuming he warned anyone and had the airports prepared for it of course. He doesn’t communicate for shit it seems. But it sure looks good keeping those dirty foreigners out right? Got to have someone to blame for this mess because he sure as hell will accept ZERO responsibility himself. He’s already tried to trot out the “past administration” bullshit too. Make sure we have daily briefings fawning over what a wonderful most excellent job he’s doing too.

I agree that with more that user facing technology evolves and becomes simpler people just won't *have* to have the skills to fix things when they break because they've always just worked.

Sometimes I do wish I was around maybe another 10 years before so that I could of grown up and had a better understanding of older machines a bit more. The rest of my team are between 11 and 14 years older than me and they have a good understanding of why lots of legacy shit was written the way it was.

However on the opposite side of that it's a lot easier for me to learn new tech skills then them. (Think SDKs, Cloud, Languages)

Also they all use the mouse, but keyboard shortcuts and terminal is so much faster.

j5g7ws,"Friendly suggestion: a graph likely would make the data far easier to understand, as in a split second the viewer could immediately see your progress over time, outliers, rate of change over time, etc. Right now it likely takes viewers many times longer to scan through the data to interpret those same things. It likely would also make your data entry slightly easier, as you would just need 2 columns: date (hit Ctrl + ; keys) and number of pushups. You could still optionally apply conditional formatting separately to the date and pushups columns in order to also partially visualize the data there.

The field of data visualization is incredibly interesting. If you're interested in more, I'd also suggest such classics as the visualization of Napoleon's Russian invasion: https://sciencenorway.no/blog-blog-from-numbers-to-graphics-statistics/charles-joseph-minards-map-of-napoleons-flawed-russian-campaign-an-ever-current-classic/1618695

Also babies are very rarely born in unexpected moments like on TV (although I was, so 🤷🏼‍♂️) 

Also, people apparently have the most unprotected sex (or are the most fertile?) during the first part of so-called “cuffing season” (Labor day through mid-December), with a noticeable brief uptick around Valentine’s Day.  

This is also when suicides really spike every year.  

Not sure if there is any relationship with those things, but a few possible hypothesis: 

1) it’s not ideal to be giving birth or getting pregnant during the peak of the winter months in lots of this country. 

2) the start of fall always makes me think hard about the passage of time, future plans, and rededicate myself to long term projects

3) fall also marks the end of summer, a time in lots of the country where it has been too hot and sticky to have much sex, or where overheated/overworked bodies might not be as fertile

The adblocker and NoScript are killer features for me. Decentraleyes and HTTPSE are useful, but not essential. The rest are bundled with the app.

**EDIT:** While we're at it, let me also plug [Slide](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide) for Reddit and [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/) for YouTube. *!Many people are recommending [Reddit is Fun](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit&hl=en), [RedReader](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.quantumbadger.redreader/) or [Boost for Reddit](http://boostforreddit.com/) and [Youtube Vanced](https://youtubevanced.com/)!*

No more ads!

**EDIT2:** 😳 my first gold ever! 🤗🤗🤗

As thanks I'll list a few more gratis, ad-free and/or FOSS apps that I like:

[Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/fdroid) - bullshit-free Chrome clone. I mainly use this in perpetual incognito mode for quickly opening ad-ridden, JS/tracker infested sites (looking at you, news outlets) linked on reddit so I don't have to adjust NoScript settings in FF all the time. Properly set up, Bromite reliably deletes all residue (cookies, etc.) once you close the app.

[AntennaPod](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.danoeh.antennapod/) for podcasts.

[OsmAnd](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=net.osmand.plus) - GoogleMaps alternative using Open Street Maps, a bit clunky sonetimes, but you can make it work *without internet connection*!

[Web Media Share](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.tobykurien.webmediashare/) for streaming, esp. Twitch

[Odyssey](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.gateshipone.odyssey/) - music.

[FBreader](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.geometerplus.zlibrary.ui.android/) - ebooks.

[Sky Map](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.google.android.stardroid/) - stargazing!

[ClipStack](https://f-droid.org/fr/packages/com.catchingnow.tinyclipboardmanager/) - clipboard manager. Soo fucking useful. Just try it!

[Hacker's Keyboard](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard/) - stupid name, good keyboard. CTRL-C/CTRL-V on your phone! No tracking. No swipe either though. 😢 I still prefer this + ClipStack over any other setup though. Speech messages ftw.

[K-9 Mail](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.fsck.k9/) - email client

*[Signal](https://github.com/signalapp) - I don't use it personally (screw my social circle), but I do believe it's one of the best WhatsApp alternatives available.*

[KeePassDroid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.android.keepass/) - password management

[X-plore](http://www.lonelycatgames.com/?app=xplore) best mobile file manager IMO. Unfortunately not on F-Droid. *!Someone also mentioned [Amaze](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.amaze.filemanager/)!*

[Aix Weather](https://github.com/pveierland/aix-weather-widget) - cool little weather widget.

**NOTE:** the F-Droid website seems to have some problems atm. If you get a 404, try refreshing the page. I double-checked all the links, they do exist. Anyway, most of these apps are available through the playstore as well.

Lets talk about other things like can we start over ?

FLATTENING THE CURVE

The idea is that as the new sars cov-2 (coronavirus) is rising the curve, so has our economy raised the economic curve so the principle that our governments are applying to flattening the curve, the same can be applied to the new economic system if it will be one.

fkwova,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Covid-19. The pain is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical genetics most of the data will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Corona's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from bat literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these infections, to realise that they're not just viral- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Coronavirus truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Covid's existential catchphrase ""Wuhan Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as China's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a COVID-19 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the 80+ aged people' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2020-03-19 00:08:42

rl5w5j,"Hey OP! I'm a data engineer who was initially pursuing data science, and can definitely understand where you're coming from. Business intelligence, data analytics, and data science are all REALLY hard fields to get a job in right now.

Some things to keep in mind:

* If you don't have a GitHub with a portfolio of projects, you're likely competing against many who do with project sections on their resume.
* If you're applying to roles in tech or bigger-named companies, it's likely that company referrals are getting calls back instead of you.
* Many companies would much rather promote someone internally into this kind of role versus hiring someone externally.
* The 3 bullet points above are not a reflection of you or your capacity to do the work well - stay confident!
* Strong SQL skills for entry level are going to be more important than anything else.

I don't know you or your resume, but maybe you'd be better served getting your foot into the door of ANY role in a company where you can move into a role like you want after a year. That's how I got my first data analyst role, and while that was a few years ago, I was NOT a marketable candidate like you are and shouldn't have even had a chance back then.

Also, I've talked to others about transitioning into this field based on my own experience, and would be happy to meet with you as well if that would help! Just keep me posted 🙂",2021-12-21 11:27:03

rl5w5j,If you are applying online.... It is going into an HR pit (I have been that HR person). There are hundreds of resumes to go through. You will have a lot better chance getting a job by trying to network. You usually get ghosted because you are a backup and they don't want to shut the door.. as douchy as that is.

rl5w5j,"Many college grads are under the impression that an interview is to show an employer why they are qualified, but that is not true. The interview is to show the employer what sets you apart from every other candidate that also got an interview. Anyone who is getting interviewed is already *qualified* for the job. 

In behavioral psychology, it would be known as motivational fit. Some BAR interviews have a dedicated question for it, and no matter how they ask it, it is always a two part question: how you are qualified, and what sets you apart from the competition. 

You also need to be able to answer it without throwing anyone under the bus. 

Lastly, if you want that part to be as painless as possible, networking is the shortcut to doing so. You 👏 have 👏 to 👏 network!",2021-12-21 07:54:36

We usually take our daughter with us wherever we are going and she does fine. She is pretty polite and can be quiet when it's needed so it's not that much of a hassle. But it is what you make out if it - if you don't train your kid around that it won't work.

Right now I'm started 2 businesses and my wife work full time and we still goes over for dinner to friends or have them over for dinner pretty often. I play TTRPG often and we love binge watching stuff together. The gym is probably the thing that we have had to sacrifice and since we have a hard time getting a babysitter our movie vists have declined a lot.

It's absolutely possible to have a competent and productive life with kids. It won't be as easy as before but totally doable. For us it is worth it - but that is something you have to figure out for yourself. 🙂

2. Grehlin the hunger hormone makes you feel much hungrier and also more grumpy. They also are gaining weight faster as the body makes them feel more hungry. This will also make restaurant meals more stressful as they feel so much more hungry.

3. Testosterone from her and her partner is much much lower. So she doesn't feel as strong nor as horny, and her husband hadn't wanted to bang her in like 10 to 20 years either.

hkzg6x,"You are being too sensitive. This meme has no roots in misogyny. At all. And there is definitely a male version. As a younger woman who has worked in customer service before for many years- let me assure you this awful, entitled, and often racist/classist behavior is a trend amongst Boomers and even some Gen X folk. My friends and I discuss it in depth, and most of us have one ridiculous Karen story.

Being upset or legitimately angry is one thing- there are healthy methods to communicate your anger with RESPECT for all parties. A Karen is someone who flies off the handle, may put BIPOC in danger with her entitlement (i.e. Amy calling the coos in central park), and acts as if the world revolves around her. 

If you are insulted by that, maybe ask yourself if you see any of your behavior in the above description. Or perhaps ask yourself if your status in society as a white person is something you want to continuously weaponize, consciously or unconsciously.

Edit: and to all the sweet Karen’s out there, you are not under scrutiny with this meme. Karen is an attitude and the name was chosen because of it’s popularity amongst Boomer’s. Us younger folk are sharp enough to know that not all of you behave that way. Pretty simple. 🤷🏻‍♀️",2020-07-04 13:05:43

t52qxa,"I’m a successful phisher, and honestly, e-mail phishing is definitely on the out. There are much more useful ways to manipulate social media systems (via manipulating the people using those platforms depending on the platform of course)to spread your seed, you can really get creative with it. E-mail phishing is just way too bad, you’re gonna not only have way lower conversion rates, but you’re also gonna have a harder time finding good emails.

I gotta admit, I haven’t actually dabbled in e-mail phishing because it never seemed attractive to me, so I’m not even entirely sure how you could get e-mail lists firsthand (apart from buying them). 

Also, ads on shady websites are definitely good. That’s why so many Indians can make money in the first place. Btw, for those of you wondering, here are the top earners based on the different fraud scenes (via my observations, these are NOT based on actual statistics, but observations over a long period of time.)

1. Russia (They operate a lot of big markets, and I mean a lot of them. They spearheaded the carding era, with JStash being a great example of what was possible, although I don’t think they were Russian (2.1 billion dollars in revenue for Jstash over its lifetime))

2. The US (The US has a lot of schemes that make a decent amount of money in the short term, with a lot of the poorer scammers being able to make some money, often with some sort of risk attached which is part of why most of these sorts of scams aren't good for the long term. It's a market with a lot of money in it, with the unemployment scams definitely being a good example of how much you could make, with billions of federal funds being stolen. Before the unemployment scams, Stripe was being targeted, and that shows you how the American fraud scene works. You tend to have a lot of these trends that become popular all of a sudden.)

3. Europe (Europe is basically like the US, but there are far fewer opportunities because the EU in general has very good anti-fraud measures. For example, carding died in Europe before it did the US, the reason for that being that 2FA is way more common, and sometimes even integrated into your social security number (or the equivalent of it)).

4. India (I have no respect for Indian scammers. What they make use of is called targeting the weak. They are even worse than those influencers that scam their own fans using shitty altcoins. These people would sell their own mom for an iPhone 13. Also, they all use the same god damn method because it works, but at the same time, nowadays most of them don't even earn that much compared to what we earn in the west, I'm talking a thousand dollars a month. That's really not a whole lot of money for selling your integrity, guys.)

5. Nigerians (They've been in the game for a long time for sure, and these people are inhumane too. 419 scams are a thing of the past, nowadays, they often target social media such as YouTube comments, Facebook groups and the likes. The thing that makes me dislike Nigerian scammers apart from them not being creative like the Indians and playing the numbers game too is the fact that they also target the weak. Lagos gave birth to romance scams, a putrid form of long term mental anguish caused upon another human being, just for the sake of earning a little bit of cash. I've gone through being in a bad relationship myself, and it can really suck the life out of you and even destroy you if you aren't all that strong mentally. I really don't get how people can do this against other human beings. At least I haven't seen videos of Nigerians taunting their victims, unlike Indians, who obviously have no respect for others whatsoever.)

6. Vietnam (The Vietnamese don't really do a whole lot of scamming, but instead, they break through anti-fraud systems to make accounts and the like, with Google accounts being the most popular, since they cost a dollar a pop, which is actually a good amount of money in Vietnam for that little effort. The more advanced people sell more expensive accounts that have better use cases. Can't hate on 'em 🤷‍♂️)

There are of course always outliars when we look at the individuals doing fraud, but this is how the scene looks in general. As for me, I want to add that I have 2 rules when it comes to morality, as I'm not a total piece of shit, as you might have caught on to.

1. Don't steal from the poor or individuals at all, actually. Companies spend more money on preventing fraud than they actually lose, they can definitely handle it, especially since the losses from fraud are already a part of the budget.

2. Don't target specific groups of people, instead, do skilled social engineering which could fool just about anyone. The former way of doing things would just make me feel dirty.",2022-03-03 20:53:50

Dear Valued Customer:

As you are aware, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 (formally known as 2019-nCoV) is the name for the respiratory syndrome caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern.

On March 5 Quest Diagnostics announced that it would launch a coronavirus (COVID-19) test. Quest is now able to receive specimens and provide testing as of March 9. The test has not been cleared or approved or authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This test has been validated according to high-complexity testing under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and is pending the FDA’s independent review under the Emergency Use Authorization for COVID-19.

The Quest Diagnostics’ SARS-CoV-2 RNA, Qualitative Real-Time RT-PCR aids the presumptive detection of nucleic acid in respiratory specimens of patients meeting the clinical criteria of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for COVID-19 testing.

Key details regarding Quest Diagnostics’ test:

Test availability: The test is available nationally. We are currently performing the test at our Quest Diagnostics Infectious Disease (QDID) laboratory in San Juan Capistrano, CA. We are scaling up testing in the next 2 weeks at other Quest high-complexity laboratories across the U.S. Test ordering: Available to order using national test code 39433. The test should be ordered on its own dedicated requisition and not combined with any other test. It is not a STAT test and a STAT pick-up cannot be ordered. Specimen collection requirements: o Effective March 9: Upper respiratory samples collected using a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab. One swab per M4, VCM, or UTM media. Only sterile Dacron® or Rayon swabs should be used. Do not use calcium alginate as they may contain substances that inhibit PCR testing. Wooden shaft swabs should also not be used.

o Initiating March 16 (can be ordered now but will be frozen upon receipt): Lower respiratory specimens including bronchial lavage/wash, nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash, or sputum/tracheal aspirate samples in a plastic, sterile, leak-proof container.

o Specimens should be shipped overnight to your local Quest Diagnostics accessioning laboratory according to standard operating procedures.

o Samples should be shipped frozen (preferred). However, samples can be shipped refrigerated at 2-8°C and are stable at this temperature for 72 hours. Cold packs/pouches must be used if placing specimens in a lockbox for courier pick-up.

Test turnaround time: Test results are typically available 3-4 days from the time of specimen pick-up and may be impacted by high demand.

Please reach out to your Quest representative with any questions regarding test pricing. Supplies can be ordered via your standard process.

We will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide updates as needed. For more details and the latest information, visit QuestDiagnostics.com/COVID-19 or cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov.

Sincerely,

Jay Wohlgemuth, M.D.

iwej16,"Debatable. I have millions of plays with major names and yet barely make a $1. It hurts when you see the executives of said streaming services now worth billions. There’s still a lot of changes that need to happen in the industry. While I am happy there’s more content for consumers and an easier platform for artists to release, there has to be methods put in place to help artists survive vs profiting off what the artists make, and ways to re-build the intimacy between artists and their fans. Consumers don’t pay attention like they did when CDs and Vinyl were the primary route to listening. There’s no connection to the artist. There’s no taking time to go through the cool booklets, etc. There’s only fast playlists & the hope that the listener might research more of what you’ve done. Don’t get me started on the lack of credits. At this point I’d rather my music just get stolen, it would hurt less than the pennies our music community makes. Sure- come see us at a festival as we watch fans rotate around like we’re on display in a revolving sushi restaurant. Thanks for paying $$$ for a ticket, we’re only getting a enough cash to cover travel just to get here. Thanks Live Nation. Oh and don’t get me started on “music schools”. Most engineers, producers, artists etc. will never be out of school debt, are sold a dream to find out you’ll be stuck working for free for at least a year in extreme conditions that should be illegal, but then when you “make it” you’ll be fighting for your credits and pay for the rest of your time in the industry. No, getting a label deal doesn’t help artists survive - you’ll be forced to create just to pay back debt. Good luck tracking your publishing- it was designed to confuse you. Most artists don’t realize they’re only getting 1/4 of their royalties. The music industry is one of the most toxic businesses I’ve ever worked in (aside from tech). I know I’m not the only one, but damn I want to join together & change shit because I’m over it. Sorry... haven’t had my coffee yet & it’s been a weekend. PSA- If you love an artist - buy whatever you can directly from them. Keep our depression away and encourage us to keep creating what you love to listen to. We’ve got a lot going on. 😩",2020-09-20 17:22:54

ctq357,I'm a girl and honestly I thought everyone had at least 1000+ matches... I guess that's only for girls 🤔,2019-08-22 14:08:47
ctq357,"Broo 😭 I hope this doesn't come off rude as, it's just some genuine advice. most of the girls your swiping won't be into too much more than the ""basic"" guy. You're probably a nice lad and have a normal life. From what I saw on your reddit profile, you are into anime. That's fine and not an issue, though from knowing a LOT of people through being a social person etc. The majority of people (at least who i know) aren't exactly ""turned on"" by a guy who slaps anime around everywhere. I personally love pokemon and yugioh and dragonball, they're some of my childhood classics, but I don't let my girlfriend into that side of me. Maybe it would be good to find sides of you that women / girls like and then focus on that.

For tinder, use a simple bio and don't give too much away, otherwise there's nothing for them to find out about you. Use as many photos of your face as you can, the more the merrier.

If you have Instagram, upload often and just use that and Snapchat as key ways to talk to them.

I'm talking from experience, of course. Though I wouldn't say I'm exactly a stud, I feel comfortable in my own skin.

Feel free to message me if you want any tips about your profile. And good luck!",2019-08-22 02:57:24

21 yo educated 6ft1 in Amsterdam and I match with about 1 3rd of the people I swipe on.

You know tinder flags you if all you do is swipe right, right?

You match with fatties because you swipe right on fatties...why even do that?

I swipe left on nearly 90% of profiles as I only swipe on people I'd actually genuinely be interested in meeting.

ctq357,"Well that makes me feel a little special 😁 

I honestly  never knew gay dudes would ever be interested. Partially bc I look very straight I think 
 

FWIW I have tinder plus so I can see who matches w me before swiping. I swiped right on like 3 guys before I realized I had no interest in talking (sorry!). 644 I think showed up as potential matches 

It was truly insane and very overwhelming, although it wasn't super difficult to find guys I actually thought were very attractive. I generally didn't read profiles and just swiped left if the first picture didn't stand out 

If I had that kind of variety w women I'd get extremely picky lmao",2019-08-22 04:31:18

I still mask in public, and I'd estimate about 40-60% of others do at stores, etc.  My office was abysmal at actually enforcing mask policy, and regularly had ""chin-diaper""-ers.  But, tbh, that was on par with their general safety culture, overall.

I think rural areas got cocky/complacent, thinking it was a ""city-problem,"" because early cases tend towards population-dense areas (esp w/ major airports).  But time enables spread, and rural areas have more limited resources.  And that's not even accounting for the politicization of masks, distancing, lockdowns, vaccines, etc.",2021-10-10 05:07:50

I just love the feeling of inhaling a strong menthol cigarette. 😩 I miss being able to smoke in the mall and other places. I understand why they stopped. But what I’ll never understand, is why u can’t smoke in a bar or nightclub. Drinking and smoking go together. If someone is that bothered by cigarettes in a bar/nightclub atmosphere then they need to stay home. A nightclub or bar is not a healthy place to be period! So who cares if someone is smoking. I’m glad my other summer home down in the Gulf of Mexico still has smoking indoors. So I enjoy it! 💖 I also don’t understand why a private owned place can’t have smoking. If a non smoker doesn’t like it, then they can choose to go elsewhere. It’s not like they are forced to be In with smokers. Do u know how much money a nightclub up north would make if it allowed smoking? But stupid state laws won’t allow it! Smh! I don’t get that part!

y79iqk,"It's not actually fearmongering, it's legitimate public health. Lung cancer in cigarettes comes from a few places, including nicotine itself (which is carcinogenic), but also from something called polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

But what are these? They're not actually added chemicals -- they're **smoke**. That's right, any time you burn a plant, part of the cell walls (lignin) turn into smoke products that can slide right inside your DNA and mess things up (in a process called intercalation).

Add to that the fact that most joints are unfiltered! Which lets even more tar and PAHs into the lungs.

Look, everyone likes weed now and again. And in the past there's been a lot of ""reefer madness"" kinda bullshit. Which is why it's so frustrating when we find out that there are legitimate concerns.

What does this mean? People should still smoke weed. But the more you smoke, the higher your risk is. And people who smoke every day for years are at serious risk of lung disease. Unfortunately. I wouldn't vote for that, but that is kinda how it shakes out 🙁",2022-10-18 21:42:49

I thought again about all these people here who are really puzzled or even angry that I made that post. How can I make it clear to you that I am a perfectly normal person that just happens to like different music than you? 

Yes, technically I might have exaggerated a bit because I heard maybe only 70 or 80 percent of them. But many of them I know very well because they are (or were) played on the radio over and over and over. And yes, technically it could be that I don't like this or that one because it was overplayed.

There's no measure for taste in any sense, so really there is nothing to argue about. If made with an honest artistic intent, there's no such thing as good or bad music, just music some people like to listen to and others don't.

mfmlho,"Just amazing. I sent links of the map to both of my parents (art country and car country, respectively). My messages are full of new art my mom found through this, and expecting car posts when my dad gets around to it.

I find it totally hilarious that the south has a Porn Continent with a Gay Island off shore 😂😂😂 But it works perfectly for browsing means.

The only thing I had a bit of an issue with was Popular Subs country not quite being linked to its topics (ie, Art Country is around the middle of main continent, but r/Art is not there, it's over with the sort of default subs country). Ultimately a minor problem but about the only thing I ran into that could be considered an issue. 

Lastly I am curious - did this map take into account similar subreddits linked in each of their sidebars? If not, incorporating this may give you a much more comprehensively connected map.

One example: r/AttackOnTitan subreddits; there is a r/characternameCult for nearly every central character in the show (a lot). They are linked via sidebars but not frequently in comments, and looking at the part of the map that contains other AoT related subs, I'm not seeing them all there, but info in the main sub sidebar would connect them all.

I'm not able to assist code editing myself, nor am I sure how much manual work it would take to incorporate connecting subs using their sidebar info, so this kind of feedback is the limit of what I can do to help. Anyone involved in working on this, please feel free to use these ideas if they would be helpful. Credit not needed.

1- also is a creep that only dates very young / not psychologically developed women so that he can have control over them and benefit from the discrepancy between them. He is willingly looking for age gap so that he can manipulate women better. 

2- Leo is not necessarily looking for control and easy-manipulation of women, it’s simply that 20s are the only ones inexperienced enough not to see his orange/red flags and accept dating him. When they get more mature, it starts to create conflict because they can fend for themselves and see the issues in Leo behaviour 

3- pure coincidence (mmmh nope)

4- these are all contracts for false relationships for some reasons / not convinced either

Thanks for the Data but it earns a bunch of 💩 💩 💩  emojis because it's shit.

Like come on guy...this is the single worst analysis of global emissions I've ever seen.


EDIT

And to add to my comment....you claim the Western Hemisphere has a population that is similar to China. This is false, the Western Hemisphere has a population of around 900M .

""The West"" which includes all of the EU has a population of about 1.4B which is closer to your reference number. But you declined to include most of the EU in your contributions.


So 

💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 

This post is total fucking shit on multiple levels and 100% misinformation. 

2nd Edit.

This also isn't even a map of the Western Hemisphere. The line runs from Grenwich, and it excludes almost all of France except for most of the Brittany region and cuts off about a quarter to a third of Spain.... and about half of the North African inclusion.


💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩.

xihnls,But aren’t we also a major consumer of China? 🤔,2022-09-20 06:07:31
xihnls,"Wow is reddit just a bunch of China bots?

1. Per capita is not a useful metric for determining whether a country is bad at emissions. The statistics would always skew in favor of countries with billions of people because energy production isn’t based on the basis of personal consumption. Moreover, people aren’t the ones leading in emissions anyway-industries are. And the planet doesn’t care about per capita. All this does is dilute the statistic in favor of countries with large populations that have little or nothing to do with the emissions. 

2. Historic carbon emissions also do not matter. China doesn’t get a pass on the climate crisis because they developed later. The problem needs resolving now. If we have a cup of water that’s about to overflow and we have to stop pouring water in it, it doesn’t matter if the person holding the pitcher has only held it for a fraction of time than others whom also poured water may have. 

3. Fucking lmao at all the people trying to mitigate China’s emissions by claiming they have more green options and trains 😂.


4. Exports to the West account for less than 20% of China’s CO2 emissions, and even if we were to remove that the map would stay the same. Furthermore, some people here have been saying things like “God forbid China provides for its people!“ wtf do you think we’re doing? Just burning CO2 for the fuck of it? And lastly, yeah we outsourced some pollution, but on the same token, wouldnt we get a pass for historical emissions on the same basis that we manufactured to provide for most of the world?",2022-09-20 06:54:01

For example I bought my house last year, put 10% down so I have to pay a little pmi, but my monthly payment works out to be $1800/month (actual mortgage price is just south of $1600).

Now when I pull up rentals in my neighborhood, a comparable house is in the 2600-3000 per month range.  😳

Had my wife and I had bad credit, and no $ down (we had proceeds from our first home that we lived in for 4 years to put down) we'd most likely not be living here.

How the fuck can people afford to rent? And why is the bar to owning a home so high?",2021-03-31 22:38:00

11193dh,"I'm not in favor of the tips included one..

I have been to endless examples of tip-included (billed as ""no tip"") establishments.. and here are some of those experiences:

went to my favorite SF (iconic) restaurant last week, cuz love the atmosphere + farm-to-table menu.. and to see what their change to 'tip included' billing was like....

*  service was horrible - shockingly horrible, which was a big surprise
*  food/bev total was $360 (rounded, for TWO!).. glss of wine was $20 for about 3 ounces (maybe 3.5 oz if being generous)
* tip was $72, which brought the total to $432
* had to ask about this - because was vague - seemed that reciept brought for credit card signature was presented in a way in which custoemrs wouldn't ask about tip included vs. not included, and then tip on top of the included graturity (this felt shady, was insulted)
* I don't mind tipping 20% ($72 in this case).. but the service was awful - and since so bad, felt bamboozeled/conned.

In Europe, becasue reaturants operate on a no-tip basis,

* employ fewer waiters/waitresses.. and all service much slower
* sldo, if/when hear an American accent.. DO expect a tip on top of 'tip-included'
* I don't mind this so much -- not the decision of the waitrons, to cover many tables - slowing service.. do always tip on top of, b/c these waitrons are lovely (ALWAYS).. and b/c why not make a meal longer - so more of an experience than a phsyical need?

Recently got my car detailed....

* price was $250, I gave $100 tip upfront.. hoping the detailer would do a better job
* this backfired. he did a crap job... really lazy, not good work. 😣
* lesson learned, but made me sad

Other examples, but no need to ramble on. Just want to state that I am now firmly back to deeming tips as a way to reward great service -- and keep this communication ability with the customer",2023-02-14 07:36:35

(Maybe!) Reading this puts me off ever moving to the US! I sympathise with my fellow North Americans. 

You have to fill out a tax return regardless of your job situation?!! Surely That’s SO time consuming. 

I’m surprised guns or cop violence weren’t included in this list.

I have a few tongue in cheek ones to add, 

Like, “strict firearms laws making it possible for people to own a gun but not give them the right or ability to wear it in the supermarket or local elementary school ” Something like that.

And the police one is a little bit different because it is a global systemic issue of course, But something like, “if a cop kills an unarmed person, they have to leave the force and find a new way to bully and prey on innocent civilians”

And The toilet stalls thing is so weird! I remember when i went to New York, seeing them for the first time, in a big shopping outlet. 😨In the end I couldn’t go! Talk about stage fright!! 

I was like, “Did they run out of materials when they were building the stalls or something!”

Oh and the VAT one would annoy me no end!! It’s just more efficient! It would make paying quicker too. Why would you want to put shoppers out like that! If you ask me, (which no one did 😅) shops should start doing that for customers. I bet they’d get more sales that way. Time is money people!!",2023-02-14 10:54:16

os2gmd,"this is simply not true. i am currently covid positive sick as hell from being exposed by a vaccinated person coming to work sick, thinking she couldn’t possibly have covid. while at urgent care being tested, the physician there told me that the majority of cases they are seeing right now are VACCINATED people becoming sick and testing positive. this is most likely due to the delta variant, and the way that they come to that conclusion is due to its shorter timeline of exposure to symptoms to positive testing. while i think showing the numbers in an easy to understand, visual way is great- it is giving people who are vaccinated an extremely false sense of security. i am an ICU nurse and have seen more than you can imagine. hope you all stay safe out there 🙏",2021-07-26 21:28:42

Now my wife does actually have a disability with daily migraines and the sun triggers them. We told them this and we got the pass. The pass you can add like up to 8 people on it with you or something like that and what it does is you “sign up” for a ride say it’s 2 hour wait. You can go do whatever you want then after those 2 hours pass you hop in the fast pass lane and hop on the ride or just get skipped to the front where a disability line jumps in.

8rfnc0,"After watching Spain vs Portugal this evening I wondered whether warmer countries had warmer colours in their flags ... so I wrote a little script to visualise it!

This doesn't take into account a country's size (size is a bit ambiguous when dealing with latitudes and not something that seemed relevant anyway). A new colour band is drawn each time we hit the bottom / top of a new country as we scan through the latitudes - thankfully that happens quite a lot so we get relatively continuous changes at this resolution.

There's a lot of red at the top thanks to Russia, Greenland and Canada I guess and there seems to be no real pattern; especially not the one ""warmer near the equator"" one I guessed there might be. Interesting either way!

One could read that and say: since 1920s to today we've all benefited overall the exact same in the end.  But the bottom 90% got their share first.  The top earners started negative and held negative for half the century, and only caught up recently... So yeah when you only plot earnings of the bottom 90© vs productivity over the century, the curve flattens in the second half.

But if the bottom 90% earned less in the war and post war years, and had more linear gains over the century, the graph would look totally fine.  Would that have been a better result? Maybe...

#### 1939–1941[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soviet_war_crimes&action=edit&section=13)]

📷Victims of NKVD prisoner massacres in June 1941📷One of the mass graves at [Katyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre) where the [NKVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD) massacred thousands of Polish Officers, policemen, intellectuals and civilian prisoners of war.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes#cite_note-Sanford2007-56)*Main articles:* [*Soviet invasion of Poland*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Poland)*,* [*Katyn massacre*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre)*,* [*Polish prisoners of war in the Soviet Union (after 1939)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_prisoners_of_war_in_the_Soviet_Union_(after_1939))*, and* [*NKVD prisoner massacres*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD_prisoner_massacres)

In September 1939, the Red Army invaded eastern Poland and occupied it in accordance with the secret protocols of the [Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact). The Soviets later forcefully occupied the Baltic States and parts of Romania, including [Bessarabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessarabia) and Northern Bukovina.

German historian Thomas Urban[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes#cite_note-OCLC/Urban-57) writes that the Soviet policy towards the people who fell under their control in occupied areas was harsh, showing strong elements of [ethnic cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing).[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes#cite_note-Urban/Verlust2-58) The NKVD task forces followed the Red Army to remove 'hostile elements' from the conquered territories in what was known as the 'revolution by hanging'.[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes#cite_note-Urban/Verlust-59) Polish historian, Prof. [Tomasz Strzembosz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasz_Strzembosz), has noted parallels between the Nazi [Einsatzgruppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen) and these Soviet units.[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes#cite_note-60) Many civilians tried to escape from the Soviet NKVD [round-ups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup_(history)); those who failed were taken into custody and afterwards they were deported to [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia) and vanished in the [Gulags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag).[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes#cite_note-Urban/Verlust-59)",2020-02-16 17:55:06

a4l0ta,"Cosine is the x component, sine is the y component

Also circles can be represented with an e in complex analysis. e^i*theta= cos theta + i * sin theta where theta is in radians... and the RHS has a real component and imaginary component which can represent the x and y components of the unit ⭕️ 
E.g. e^(i*pi) = cos pi + i sin pi = -1 + 0i =-1
This is called Eulers Identity and is often called the most beautiful equation in mathematics since you have i, e, 1, pi, and 0.  e^(i pi) +1=0",2018-12-09 19:06:30

a4l0ta,"This is also very cool, and close to what I was thinking of. Although this appears to use the TAN line to create the second triangle, from which the second circle is calculated.

What I was thinking - and take it with a grain of salt - is that if the point of the first triangle are ABC, then through the side lengths AB, BC, and CA, we define the first circle, which I will call ABC. That circle has point A at its center.

But, it appears to me that the circles defined by BCA (with B at the center) and CBA (with C at the center) must also fluctuate. The line segments will always be the same, but the center of circles B and C will move as circle A rotates. And, I conjecture, the radius and relative position of circles B and C will also fluctuate, tracing a very “cosmic rose” type pattern that is innately created by the geometry of the first circle. 

Or, to put it another way, this animation made me think that for any set of three points, there are actually three circles - one centered on each point and then determined by the other two points.

I could be completely wrong - but I already think what you have done from my silly little conjecture is SO AWESOME. So THANK YOU!!

🙏 🌹 

EDIT: looking at it more, you might have it. Because AB and AC will always be the same distance. Only BC varies. So it really is only one other possible circle? I think? 

Basically there is a circle around point C (which I am envisioning as the point that traverses the original circle), that varies in radius in the length of the line BC. The B circle would use line AB as its radius, and so would also be equivalent to the A circle - just centered on circle B.

One could plot the points where circle C intersects circle B, I suppose, as circle A is drawn.

dcrwq2,"The majority of people in the US live in heavily populated cities (not just the inner cities, but larger suburbs as well). These areas predominantly vote for more liberal representatives for our government.

The number of counties, or the relative size of the area people occupy is completely irrelevant. All that should matter for a presidential election is the total number of votes. The Senate was designed to be the part of government that would provide less populated, rural states with an equal status as densely populated urban states. Not the House, or the Presidency. Those were intended to represent the will of the majority of citizens. 

The reason urban areas are more liberal than rural communities is that people who live in densely populated areas are forced to interact with people from different cultures, and ethnic backgrounds in their daily lives. Therefore the scare tactics that, “Mexicans and Muslims are coming here to rape and murder us!,” aren’t as effective. When people know real life immigrants from Central America from their daily commutes, or work with actual Muslims in their offices, they can determine that the scare tactics employed by “conservatives” are pure 🐂💩!!",2019-10-03 20:24:30

hm5skw,"I mean, the costs don't seem that high when you consider the bigger picture.

The costs of leaks inside the walls which you don't notice until a large enough amount of water has been doing it's job for long enough to become apparent, could be astronomical in comparison. Specially if you have to restore the property to a historical standard, using the same materials and techniques as were common for the period it was built.

The health problems associated with water leaks and development of fungi would also make the challenges surrounding redoing the plumbing seem manageable.

And purely the value of the property itself should land the cost of redoing the plumbing in a ""significant, but not really that much"" ballpark.

> Now ask yourself how frequently your average homeowner will choose to do that, or use a slightly crappy shower.

Yeah, considering the decisions I've seen made by larger groups of homeowners working together, I guess you're right 😅

More on that point ""asking the right questions"" implies handwaving recent positive case data as mere correlation in regards to increased testing.

This is however totally disregarding the death tolls. In summer we were having five deaths per day and now we're hitting five hundred.

Furthermore the global total is 52 million cases and of those 1.6 million died. To simplify that a bit let's call it one in fifty chance of dying, which may go up or down a bit depending on how shite ones country is doing. 

Last few months the UK has been getting 20k positives per day, divide that by 50 we get 400 deaths. 2800 a week. We're doing 3000 +/- actual deaths a week, so in short fuck anyone in denial whining about more testing being the problem. We are shamefully right on target as we continue to flounder.

7v7jji,"That's what I love about it. When I was just learning JavaScript I created [an interactive version of the double pendulum](https://simulations.science/sims/DoublePendulum/) and played with it for hours. It's just so satisfying and mesmerizing.

--------------------

**[Edit]**:

1. As some have pointed out, **the inputs are meant to be adjusted while the simulation is paused.** Not doing this can get...trippy. 😂

2. If you want to view the code (in Chrome), right click -> inspect -> sources tab -> view `Double_Pendulum.js`. It's not minified or anything. It's the exact source code with comments and everything. (This was some of the first JS I've ever written, years ago...It shows.)

3. How does it work? There are typically two differential equations that describe a double pendulum's motion. I just used the simple Euler's Method to approximate the pendulum angles at each time-step, and spit out the locations to a HTML canvas. Some people like to use other integrators (Verlet, Runge-Kutta, etc) which have different trade offs. Euler's Method can have issues like losing energy, and (in my example) flying off da railz if you use a large initial angular velocity. Sorry! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",2018-02-04 17:58:08

6r3ew4,"Trust me, he may not be keeping data in Excel but he definitely is tallying that shit up in his head. 

I'm the same way in the morning. Depending on workload for the day, I spend 15-60 mins casually rotating between going through work email and system updates, looking at social media and listening to podcasts.

There's a guy on my team who has decided he is Jr. Manager (he is definitely not) and he is always making snide comments about how much time I spend on my phone in the morning. 

It might make me worry, except this is the same asshat who leaves early or calls out sick whenever we have a spike in work volume and spends at least 2-3 hours a day either away from his desk taking epic shits or sitting with his back to his computer in a mediocre middle-aged douchebag pow-wow, chit chatting about fishing, camping, bacon and his nagging wife. (Add at least 30 mins a day spent making REALLY creepy comments to the women on the team. I had to go in for a sleep study a few months ago and his sage advice comment was ""I hope you don't masturbate in your sleep because they film you."" 😑😑😑)

And because I AM the person on the team who has been quietly assigned by our boss to track important data like who handles the most work with the most efficiency and accuracy, I am keenly aware of the fact that even with my morning Reddit and coffee wake up time, most months he completes less than 1/2 of the workload that I do, which amounts to about 2/3 of the workload of an average team member who isn't me.

kugn7e,"I keep seeing people confusing sex with gender way too much or saying really silly things like they are both made up by people. 




Gender is a biosocial construct, the evidence suggests this. 






However, sex is a biological reality dependent on the reproductive system of each species of life. Some species are asexual, others are monoecious, and others like humans are dioecious. 




Within biology, the sex of dioecious species is dependent on the type of gamete an individual can produce. Some make sperm, we call these males. Some make eggs, we call these females. 






There are individuals who, because of syndromes, developmental disorders, malformations, genetic anomalies, and other atypical conditions, do not clearly fit into these categories.






Within the human species, individuals who do not have any of these medical conditions can be said to be either male or female. Sex is binary in healthy humans, an individual can either naturally make eggs or make sperm.






>""Sex: Either of the two main categories (male and female) into which humans and most other living things are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions. The fact of belonging to one of these categories. The group of all members of either sex.""




Angus Stevenson, Maurice Waite (2011). Concise Oxford English Dictionary: Book & CD-ROM Set. OUP Oxford. p. 1302. 


https://books.google.com/books?id=4XycAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1320






>""A single body can function as both male and female. Sexual reproduction requires both male and female haploid gametes. In most species, these gametes are produced by individuals that are either male or female. Species that have male and female members are called dioecious (from the Greek for 'two houses'). In some species, a single individual may possess both female and male reproductive systems. Such species are called monoecious (""one house"") or hermaphroditic.""




William K. Purves, David E. Sadava, Gordon H. Orians, H. Craig Heller (2000). Life: The Science of Biology. Macmillan. p. 736. ISBN 978-0-7167-3873-2.

>male [māl]


>an individual of the sex that produces spermatozoa.




Spermatozoa are not a social construct. 




>female [fe´māl]


>an individual of the sex that produces ova or bears young.




Ova are not a social construct.

j214ja,"This is a wonderful comment and I will (try to) come back and give it a deeper answer later, but quickly - 

> Foveal Curl  - Was it a result you were expecting?

No, I was not! This was very much a voyage of discovery! The first part was noticing the spirals (Side note - area MST in your visual cortex is VERY responsive to spiral motion) and then that led to the sorta realization that the curl was related to movement trajectory. That's the beauty of exploratory data like this - The potential for unexpected discovery is quite high! (then the next step is figuring out the hypothesis driven experiment that will test whether that is a real part of locomotor control) 

> Ocular torsion  - 

My eye tracker does NOT measure torsion, though as you note it is certainly relevant! No modern eye tracker measures torsion, largely due to historical reasons surround 'Listing's Law""  (details get complicated)

A big part of my adventures into the next iteration of this project will be finding a way to measure ocular torsion, for exactly the reasons you state. (however that said, torsion has a pretty small max extent, so it would not be enough to fully cancel foveal curl) (Join the Discord if you want to be part of that journey! https://discord.gg/r3UdBz)

I stopped using condiments. I quit eating so much red meat. My life sucked. That was all the fun stuff. Nothing worked so I took up consuming most of that stuff again.

I don't have AC but we open the windows at night to cool the house to 17/18 and then try to maintain it by closing the blinds if the sun is shining in. It's usually up to 21/22 by evening, before it's cold enough outside to open up again. The times when it stays around 20 all night are brutal! The house never resets to cool and we end up at 25+ indoors 😭

The humidity makes a difference too of course. Winter is so dry already plus the furnace pumps out dry air. But summer can be quite humid at times and makes the heat unbearable! The same outdoor temperature in Arizona feels much better, like 25° or so is absolutely fine for me there. But here anything over 20 is often uncomfortable.

jqga3a,"I remember I was at a sleepover with my band section back in high school.

My ex boyfriend, his best friend (also my crush), and myself were the only ones still awake. Somehow we got on the topic of sexuality. When my crush said he was bi I was blown away. I’m bi but I had never ever met a bi guy before.

All I remember was feeling my crush explode in size 10 fold. Also, when I told him I was bi too there was just a sudden kinship there. So few people were out in my school at the time.

And then my ex had to ruin it by getting all weird and being all like “we slept in the same room together!” Like... What? He’s bi, not a rapist. Fucking weirdo. I fucking dodged a bullet with that one (my ex later also raped his fiancé in college so.... Me thinks there’s a lot of projection going on there).

Idk about other women, but I just tend to feel like bi men are more in tune with themselves. More open and honest. So I while I know *why* straight women are weird with bi men, I just can’t understand it. These chicks don’t know what they’re missing out on. 🤷",2020-11-08 23:35:00
jqga3a,"Also a huge, huge, huge caveat is the sample pool itself. 

People don’t know shit about themselves from 18-24. And not just in partners. Some don’t accept their own sexual preferences or curiosity until their 30’s or 40’s. 

In fact, on the subject of that, I’m pretty sure I saw a study online that said a pretty high percentage of men actually start experimenting with other men once they hit middle age or older. 

Not to mention religion plays a huge roll in this as well. Some don’t admit their sexuality cause they feel it conflicts with their beliefs. Which tend to change as one ages too.

Edit: case in point, me. If you’d asked me from age 18-just recently I would have  said I am  99.9% sure I’m straight. And yet now, after rewatching the first season, I might be open to at least trying something with True Detective era Matthew mcconaughey🤷‍♂️",2020-11-09 00:44:27

9r9mqd,"What a joke. That employee will work for six months and realize how bad they’re getting fucked.

My first boss basically looked at me like a kid out of poverty or something, and paid me $24k for an on-call job.

We had a talk and I hinted that I was ready to leave. I asked him, “What if I told you someone’s willing to pay me 55k?” 

He was offended, and said “That’s ridiculous, I’ve been doing this for x years and I only make 83k.”

He called me the next morning and doubled my salary to 40k.

Little did his bitch ass know, I got that offer for 55k.

iwyzma,"We spent roughly the same amount for a wedding abroad (California), which isn't too bad.

Couple of things helped keep the costs down:

* A very generous good friend let us use his back yard for the reception (we did a bbq) and he even was our officiant
* family & friends paid for their flights from Europe + their accommodation themselves
* we had no DJ, just a spotify playlist and active speakers
* we did all the decoration and lighting at the reception site ourselves (which kept us very busy during our stay)
* we bought all the alcohol & other drinks at Trader Joe's and BevMo and skipped the bar tender (self service bar)

Food was crazy expensive and we also hired an agency to organize the ceremony at the beach, which would have been impossible for us to do.

We had a beautiful (yet unusual) wedding and I'd definitely do it again.

But we also had the most stressful weeks of our lives prior to the wedding 😂",2020-09-21 18:28:19

iwyzma,wow that's a lot of money. We spend like 2.5k Euros 😄,2020-09-21 19:36:40
iwyzma,Our wedding cost less than £100 😂 That's inexpensive,2020-09-21 19:39:42
iwyzma,"Here's how it goes if you're Asian:
1) Each guest at the reception table is expected to give $100. There are usually 10 guests per table. YMMV of course but this per guest amount also goes up with inflation. Each member of an invited family count as a guest, except little kids.
2) Close family members (close aunts, uncles) are expected to give 10x the standard amount.
3) Bride and groom's parents are expected to give at least 3x (usually 5x) of close family members.

An average Asian wedding near me is about 30 tables. You do the math.
Oh, did I mention that some families bring more guests than RSVP'ed? Yeah, I needed to add like 5 extra tables for my wedding.

Some people try to make a profit by holding reception at a crappy restaurant/venue where they pay less than $400 per table (food cost & service). Decrease cost, maximize income. Crazy to treat your wedding as a ""business"" but some people do. That expensive honeymoon doesn't pay for itself.

For non-Asian guests, you start a registry and hope for the best.

Anyway, parents are really looking forward to their kids' weddings. If anything, to recover the costs of previous weddings 😂. Because of this, and the fact that weddings are treated as an important life ""accomplishment"" (that bride/groom's parents can show off to families and friends), small weddings are out the window.

It's not bad. It just makes for big, festive  celebrations. Despite all that money coming in, couples tend to pay extra into it because they themselves want a big, beautiful wedding.
The point is: you don't have to foot most of the bill. The community helps itself.",2020-09-21 19:48:13

fw4iv0,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Futurama. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Bender's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from John Hughes' films, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Futurama truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Zapp Brannigan's existential catchphrase ""Stop exploding, you cowards!"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Douglas Adams' *Hitchhikers' Guide to the Universe*. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Matt Groening's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Futurama tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eye only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2020-04-07 00:49:56

While true, that doesn't mean that there is a failure in representation in the legislative branches. The House is intended to represent people by proportional population; it does so. The Senate is intended to represent states by equal representation; it does so.

You can't add the constituencies of two different apportionment models and two different systems *a la* the Electoral College and then claim ""The Electoral College doesn't provide direct proportional representation!! It has a inherent advantage for states with low population!!"" ... because the answer is ""Always has been 👩‍🚀🔫👨‍🚀""

That's not what I am talking about though, maybe read better next time. Now just because I don't know if there's alien life doesn't mean that I start worshiping little green men. You don't know leprechauns don't exist. They could exist on another planet or dimension and be the creators of the world with their cauldron of gold, you don't know. You see how stupid that sounds?? You are basically worshipping a leprechaun. Just because we don't know, doesn't mean we can just make up shit. Just like when people didn't know how the sun rose, they made up that Apollo was hurling it across the sky on his four-horse chariot every day. It's so dumb. Reality doesn't change. If there's aliens, that's a reality now. Just because we haven't discovered them doesn't make them not reality. The fact is we don't know. You don't get to make up shit as you do, that stupid. I worship the blue people on planet Aquarius then. We don't know they don't exist. It's madness.

God is life outside of the universe? You make me laugh! What a claim! Leprechaun are the source of universe then if we are all making shit up. I have read the Bible 😂 and just read it again recently in fact and it's a book for deranged people. There's enough geological, archeological, historical, scientific, linguistics evidence to debunk that book a million times over. I have fun reading people actually studying that shit, not someone with a preconceived bias that somehow invented himself an imaginary friend. How do you know that god is outside the universe? It's bullshit you all say to argue over the fact that there's no evidence of god. You just push it outside the universe. It's so basic god of the gaps, it's funny. People said god was on the mountains before, we went there, nothing. Then he was above the clouds, we went there, nothing. Then he was the sun, we went beyond that, nothing and now he is beyond the universe. We'll go there, in the future and I am sure they will find nothing. Then god will be beyond outside the universe. Keep pushing your god back and back, it'll disappear easily. 

You don't even understand the basis of science so don't talk about things you don't know. Science ameliorates, it refines, facts just get more precise. Your god notion is static and just gets smaller every single day. Your god who needed spit to heal people 😂, your god who you think is about love when he clearly says he is only there for Israelites and calls a Canaanite woman asking for help a dog. Your god who only helps her after she denigrates herself for it. Your god who said the world would end soon and people are still waiting after 2000 years. Your god who asked everyone to sell their stuff and give to the poor but not perfume to be used on him cause he was a narcissistic dude. He even says that people won't have him for long but they will always have the poor. Why? Wasn't the world supposed to end soon? Your god who delivered Israelites from slavery in Egypt but no archeological evidence of such Exodus has been found. Your god who delivered Israelites to go get lost for 40 years in a place that takes 9 days to traverse lol. Your god who moved Israelites from Egypt to go further into their promised land which was more Egypt since it belonged to the Egyptians. Your flood myth that is copied from the Epics of Gilgamesh, Sumerian texts. Your flood that never happened as there are geological evidence there was no global flood. Adam and Eve not existing as shown in evolution, with evidence from transitional fossil to retroactive viruses within DNA. Your god whose birth narrative doesn't even match at all between Luke and Matthew, they don't even follow the same path, the same years. Your crucifixion, resurrection narrative that if anyone with half a braincell did a horizontal comparison of line to line, would sit that it doesn't match. It's hilarious to me when I see how easily you guys get brainwashed over some goat hearders writing from centuries ago. One thing the book gets right. You are all sheep for the cult leader shepherd, getting fleeces without knowing. You guys have been so indoctrinated and fear instilled in you to never question that you never asked yourself what if it's all fake, it's all to control you and swindle you out of your money. But no, you are too fearful, too scared of hell, a perfect grift for scared people. 

Maybe instead of reading the Bible and getting your brain turned into more mush, learn to read history, scholarly sources, archeological evidence, read about retroviruses, biology, geology and then you can talk.",2023-03-02 05:04:05

Me in garage and says: “you have to smell this, it smells just like peach faygo “ pulls mask down and takes a whiff.....nothing. Quick pulls mask back up and says “oh shit”

Cousin smells weed and looks at me as she puts her mask back on. “Ummm we should be outside “ everyone scrambling for the door. I go in the house and wife cracks open a jar of jalapeño sauerkraut her brother made. I take a big whiff and nothing. Cousin on porch gets the jar about arms length away and gags.

I am incredibly lucky. I had a great aunt and uncle who were childless and, either through dumb luck or prescience, left their inheritance to all the kids in my generation and not my parents.

I bought 2016. House has gone up in estimated value about 50%. That is bonkers in 7 years.

I expect it to drop back at least 15%, probably more. When it happens, not only are people going to get skanked by higher interest rates, some are going to fall into different LTV brackets, maybe even go negative equity if they bought in the last 12/24 months.

tchjny,"Average net salary is a bad metric to describe a country. The median is a better metric - especially if you want to show that a population might struggle because of that.

The average is calculated by adding all salaries and dividing the sum by ne number of salaries. So if Jeff Bezos (let’s say he owns 150b USD) is in a room with 149 people with 0 USD the average says that they‘re all billionaires. The median takes all amounts in a line from lowest to highest and uses the one in the middle.

Example: It says 1.55 % in the US.

According to SSA,

Source: https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/central.html

the average net income in the US was ~ 53k USD in 2020. The expenses would be amounting to ~ 822 USD (1,55 % of 53k).

If you take those 822 USD and apply them to the median income (Edit: ~ 34k USD) , which affects many more people, they amount to ~ 2.4 %.

Now be the numbers +/- a bit - the fact is that the average will mostly - and knowingly - be used to give people wrong impressions about income, furthering people‘s reluctance toward realizing the reality of the obscene income inequality around the globe.

I mean if your 15 miles out from your last stop you better leave at 3:30-4pm just to maybe make it back to the office by 5ish and that’s time on the clock owners not bringing in income unless it’s unreasonably high rates. 

But what area do you reside in? It may be getting better since the exodus to Texas, Boise and Colorado. My best friend is from Orange County and also lived in Irvine and Newport and those areas are a little better than downtown LA obviously.

I guess strategically it makes a lot of sense though. It's been done since the beginning of time. Send out thousands of barely kept soldiers to be gunned down and wear down the enemy defences while learning valuable intel.

w4mcmb,"Lol this is such blatant bs. 
The “article” is clearly written in a way to insinuate things as fact without looking at multiple variables. 
The data as presented could just as easily show that Democrats living in Republican states are watching tons of transgendered porn. In fact it is much more likely that this is the case. All the areas that the article suggests as Republican are broad I.e. Texas, Florida, 
But all the data regarding porn searches is much more localized around major metropolitan areas, inhabited by Democrats. 

Texas is a red state sure, but when you find democrats there you can bet they live in Dallas. Also, it seems to make sense that these people who are ideologically out of sync geographically are watching misfit porn about trannys. 🤷🏻‍♂️

5c5k4e,"I would hope that you would understand what I am implying. Trump campaigned for the non college educated voters to come out. Those are the ones that are being affected the most by the liberal politics. Lets be honest tho. The only reason trump won that election even if he had the rust belt followers is because the Bernie supporters jumped ship. They and a good majority of the country are tired of the politics that do not work. If it wasn't for the democratic leadership sticking there crooked little hands into fixing the primaries in the favor of Hillary we would be watching president elect Bernie on television. I think that the whole nation will be surprised however with how well the long time democrat who ran as a republican will do. He may not be the first black president but he is the first president with no prior political or military experience. Your statement of college educated voters lean left is incorrect by the way. A factual statement would be that the college educated tend to vote for the party that wins the election that year.

http://www.gallup.com/poll/139880/election-polls-presidential-vote-groups.aspx

It is also factual that the margin in educated voters when a republican wins office is higher than when a democrat wins office. I can see how you are confused though because you are correct in colleges with little kids being democrats. I wanted people to just give me stuff when I was a little kid too.

Which maybe just maybe is why they have to protect these idiots from getting wiped out.  Look at the masses right now who clearly have never witnessed a pump and dump😂😂😂.   

With that said people getting screwed by RH have only themselves to blame here.

l9f4nu,Yes. Naked shorting should not be. If we had an intelligently designed financial system it would not be physically possible to short more shares than are in the free float. I hate 🌈🐻 but I do think they have some role to play to help balance moves in the market. One thing that really pisses me off though is that it is not mandatory to OPT IN  to your shares being lent out to short with many brokers and many people don't know that if they are using margin you'd better believe those shares are also being lent out. I use leaps when I want leverage for this reason. You are still paying for the leverage but at least you aren't paying to also open up yourself to get f'd on the other side.,2021-01-31 17:47:20
l9f4nu,Out of the goodness of their heart? 💎💎,2021-01-31 21:11:07
l9f4nu,"That’s not the whole truth. 

TL;DR: It’s likely that robinhood is having liquidity issues, and couldn’t cover the capital requirements to guarantee the trades could go through. 

Its seeming more and more like like robinhood couldn’t front the capital to settle all the trades that happened. 

DTC set capital requirements for GameStop shares at 100% due to the volatility. Since Robinhood started operating as its own clearing house, that means they had to front all the capital to DTC for the trades that were occurring. Given the volume, Robinhood more than likely didnt have the capital to cover for 2days while the shares settle. 

So we are dealing with a brokerage that has liquidity issues, which is nearing a death sentence for brokerages. 

The thing is Robinhood should honestly have just said this was happening, and been transparent with us. Because the alternative was (and is) the Internet now thinks they are colluding with institutional short sellers. 

The reality is it’s likely a combination of both of these things, but my money (besides being on GME 🚀) is on Robinhood having liquidity issues.",2021-01-31 23:25:59

suqj9n,"Im sorry but this isn’t true, prices do go down. Been working in retail for 16 years. There’s many factors that make it go up (shipping ports, pandemic, material shortages, material costs, labor shortages, politics, tarrifs, etc) but they do adjust back down once those issues are solved.

As an example, when workers were striking in California ports a few years ago the prices did go up due to low supply. But once they fixed their issues and they opened back up, they went back down to what it used to be before the strikes. If a company just keeps its prices high while the costs have gone back down, then a competitor will take advantage of that and eat its lunch. Thats why they have to adjust (down or up). Unless they’re a monopoly like telecommunications, big pharma, etc. Then yeah, thats a different story 🤔",2022-02-17 16:42:49

So wonderfully amazing!!

Cones mediate high-acuity vision and are utilized when lighting is good.

Rods and cones are the receptors in the retina responsible for your sense of sight. They are the part of the eye responsible for converting the light that enters your eye into electrical signals that can be decoded by the vision-processing center of the brain. Cones are responsible for color vision. Every green mark on this image is a specific ion channel necessary for the function of these cones. The cones marked in magenta are responsible for detecting colors on the spectrum from red to green. The cones marked in blue are responsible for detecting the color blue. Researchers are investigating this ion channel as a potential explanation behind cone-rod dystrophy, an inherited disease that can cause vision loss over time.

Most brains can, at least. Some people — roughly 8% of men but just half a percent of women — inherit genes that fail to produce three fully functional cones. Like artists working with restricted palettes, the brains of these “colorblind” folks can process a limited number of shades. At the other end of the scale, some people — usually women — appear to have the genetic machinery to make four cones, letting them tell the difference between two shades that appear identical to most people. 🤗",2021-01-01 12:06:51

The fact that early-stage infections may present as pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic at detection shouldn't be controversial. Neither should the \*possibility\* that such infections may progress to actual severe COVID, especially in patients that are already hospitalized and therefore already at higher risk \*as a cohort\*.

The study showing 40% asymptomatic infections doesn't attempt to determine the percentage of infections that \*remain\* asymptomatic. It's calling out the reality that there is significant transmission risk from individuals that are \*asymptomatic at detection\*. The generally accepted pre-Omicron unvaxxed rate of true asymptomatic infections is about 20%. Vaccinated individuals are probably double that. Omicron may or may not change the ratio.

The point estimate for infected hospitalization ratio for infections in the paper you linked is 2.1%. .4% is the estimate for those under 40. Over-65 it's greater than 9%.

If you have a good understanding of the ratio of infections to cases, it's quite simple to estimate the number of hospitalizations from cases, especially since it's fairly easy to account for the lag in detection to hospitalization.

There were 900,000-ish reported cases yesterday. The case to infection ratio is probably 6x or so, meaning 5.4 million cases.

Assuming a 2.1% hospitalization rate, just the cases reported yesterday would add 113,400 hospitalizations \*for\* COVID.

In one day.

Make whatever assumptions you want. A hospitalization rate a quarter of the above is unsustainable.",2022-01-13 19:29:53
s2vni6,"😂 COVID clearly cares about politics, given the vast differences in death and hospitalization rates in red vs blue counties. That’s reality, it’s data. Would you like links, or can you stumble upon them yourself?

Yes, Trump is responsible for his red team dying. I’m glad Biden is there to clean his mess up. Those who listened to the policies of his administration have overwhelmingly been spared hospitalization and death.

If the other side wants to ignore those policies, I encourage them to do so. I just wish they’d die for the principles, rather than cowardly run to the hospital.

Edit: and again, you said voting blue doesn’t protect you from COVID. It is correlated with doing just that <3",2022-01-14 05:25:08
s2vni6,"I think you are having trouble with reading comprehension.

Well A) yes Michigan is clearly one, and B), I think a lot of the states you conveniently left off are.

That’s the point, you numbskull. We are discussing if voting blue is correlated with you having better odds with COVID. Why would we count the deaths under a red admin for that? We already established with county data that they don’t care if people die or are hospitalized with it.

Those people were majority republicans who refused to follow the support given to them by the administration. Those are the facts. Again, do you need help finding the links?

Not following those policies is to blame, because the politics of one side have become dependent on their base not caring. 

Again, COVID kills and hospitalizes Republicans at higher rates than Democrats. Thems the facts 🤷‍♀️ so yes, it does care about politics. If reds joined blue policies, there would be a drastic reduction in COVID hospitalizations and deaths.",2022-01-15 00:40:06

Not from 1000% mark ups from government contracts. (I was in when Obama was Commander In Chief). I think if you sat down with a conservative, you'd find many share the same social view points but don't want heavy taxes. Democrats are supposed to be for peace and tolerance.

But assuming you're going for the looser definitions, where ""classical"" doesn't refer specifically to the classical period and where ""piece"" doesn't have to be an *entire* work (i.e. that a movement with a work counts as a ""piece""), then...

The two that come immediately to mind are the prelude of Wagner's *Das Rheingold* and Ligeti's *Lux Aeterna*. I'm sure there are plenty more; it's a virtual guarantee that more modern composers are going to play around with never changing key, simply because it breaks with tradition.

Also, while this technically doesn't qualify, Ravel's *Bolero* stays in the same key for the entire piece, except for a shift that last around 20 seconds close to the end.

And then there's John Cage's *4′33″*. But maybe that's cheating. 😁",2022-11-27 05:40:52

Bro, hey Jude is a 7 minute long song with multiple key changes, complex vocals and is almost constantly put near the top of music critics best songs of all time lists.  Just because you don't like the song doesn't mean it isn't musically complex.  I'd guess (and I will admit I couldn't care less about listening to Kendrick Lamars music, so maybe I'm wrong here) Hey Jude is objectively a more complex song than anything Kendrick has ever put out.  The inclusion of Hey Jude on your ""not musically complex"" list invalidates your entire comment imo.

[The ultra-rich are hoarding as much as $32 trillion ($32,000,000,000,000) in offshore accounts to avoid taxes.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth-idUSBRE86L03U20120722)  As a way to understand just how much 32 trillion is, let's use time as  an example. One million seconds is 12 days, and one billion seconds is  31.7 years. That's already a massive difference between a million and a  billion, but how much is 32 trillion seconds? It's over a million years.

Most people know that wealth inequality is a huge issue, but they don't understand just how bad it is. Here's an example: **If  you had a job that paid you $2,000 an hour, and you worked full time  (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all  of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have  to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much money as Jeff  Bezos.**

I've been  researching this issue for years because I was shocked at just how bad  it really is, and I've put together some information to help illustrate  it.

Every year we think the best solution is to come up with another rule, to combat the issue and show that they (politicians) care and or are listening to you. Well that just creates another 10 problems down the line. 
Life is simple. Find your values. Things that mean the most to you. Like healthcare, equal rights and so on. Not your favorite coffee or favorite model. Then once you found yourself. Move to that area were those values are respected. People will gravitate towards you. 
Instead we jump into the hamster wheel. Go in debt, make children and debate with people we don’t even know or like. Then around 40-50 we hit that window. What’s life’s? actually about living and doing something you love. We divorce , go into more debt, fucking up our kids futures and then eventually we die. Wow that was fun! 
The only way you’re going to create change is money. So if this value of yours means so much to you. Then position yourself to succeed and strip the money out of politics. Anyone can be a victim, not everyone can be a hero. 
We need more hero’s and the only way you create that, is to ask questions and educate the youth. 
So let me ask you this, if you changed your dominant hand and used your least dominate hand, it would be a struggle right? We’ll think about the kids growing up in the 50’s if you spoke out you would be shot or Killed. They learned these values through their parents. They saw pain in this and thought it was normal. All you can do,ask questions to these racist people. find why they think like this? Remember though you can’t force some one to change their opinions.Would you like if the bank would force you out of your own home? No. Force isnt the solution. You can’t change everyone, you can just educate them, but also respect them. Like cigarettes, time is the only variable, that matters. 30 years will be better than the last 30 years. In this department.
We put too much trust in institutions. Educate yourself. If you can’t explain the situation to a youth, in one clear sentence and they can grasp the entire concept of racism out of it. Then how much do you truly know? Everyone have a great day. Smile more. We only have 100 years or so, if everything goes well. Enjoy it, find your passions and make a difference.

nbvox3,"> Uneducated anti intellectual rants about issues the ranters don't really understand is a much bigger issue than starlink ever will be.

You should try not to assume things from people you don't know. I rant because I know what I'm talking about. I'm not a rocket scientist, but I'm not a guy talking out of an article he read on the Internet either.

Satellites don't become debris in a 1:1 ratio. They become debris in a 1:millions ratio. A satellite can be turned into millions of coin-sized chunks that, given the speed at which they travel through space, can by themselves destroy another satellite. What I mentioned was described [by a Nasa scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome) decades ago. But maybe NASA scientists are ""uneducated anti-intellectuals"" in your book, too.

[It is a concern for the IAU (International Astronomical Union)](https://www.ft.com/content/7ded0def-1715-4d01-880b-939a89cc33d7), too. But maybe IAU means ""Idiotic Anti-intelectual uneducated"" for you.

If you think I wrote my rant because I saw the visualization, took it as real, and made an impression out of it, you are utterly wrong.

> Astronomers will have no issue observing the sky due to star link

https://www.livescience.com/space-junk-blocks-view-of-cosmos.html, https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/spacexs-dark-satellites-are-still-too-bright-for-astronomers/ I could share many more articles, or more specialized ones. SpaceX is actively working on making their satellites as dim as they can. I guess they are just throwing money because ""it's not an issue for real™ astronomers"".

> just absolutely tiny sections of it

How is this relevant? A light polluting the sky can pollute the tiny section you care about, too. And hell, [real astronomers are worried about Starlink](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18642577/spacex-starlink-satellite-constellation-astronomy-light-pollution), but I guess real astronomers are not real astronomers in your book.

> “It’s going to become increasingly likely that the satellites will pass through the field of view and essentially contaminate your view of the Universe,” Darren Baskill, an outreach officer of physics and astronomy at the University of Sussex

""Officer of physics and astronomy at the University of Sussex"" or, as you'd call him, an ""uncultured anti-intellectual swine"".

> Hopefully this nonsense will stop once the millionth satellite is launch with still no collisions ever happening.

Collisions are already happening. Even [collisions between two satellites happen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_satellite_collision)

tl;dr some day you'll grow up and you'll discover that everybody not agreeing with you is not automatically an ""Uneducated anti-intellectual"". Moreover, you'll discover that the anti-intellectual was you all along, that want to impose your exact views and disqualify everything else as flat-earthism and anti-vaxxicm. You just wanna be right and attacking people rather than their arguments is an easy way not to put effort on your arguments.",2021-05-14 08:58:13

I didnt realize you could guild comments for a long time, so I had a bunch accumulated. Are you saying you get more the longer you have it? I had over 20k when I figured out I had coins. I didnt realize there were different gifts either, I thought it was just gold, so I was giving them away a lot. Like any comment that made me laugh out loud, took a lot of time to do, or was really thoughtful and caring. I like knowing there are different amounts you can give now so I can keep going longer .

My favorite one was I was watching a broadcast of some chill hilarious asian dude  who was broadcasting during his night shift  at his security job, and it was kept going if he got gilded. He was so appreciate of people gilding him! I wish more did, I would have more but I didnt want to seem like an obsessive fan girl. Not yet 😂 now that I see how much it really costs, I'll probably buy more when I run out because I love giving and getting gifts and I've only received a thank you from the broadcaster and no one else I've gilded, but I bet it feels good to have a comment get a gift and I don't need to get acknowledged to keep doing it.

Nonsense. It would just mean fair elections.

*Precisely* - and states should be incentivized to grow and become stronger economically so that people are attracted to them (and therefore, they gain more power via votes). The current system outright disincentivizes this. 

>	Maybe in the future Wyoming will have some economic boom and people will move there, who knows.

Right. And when they do, their votes shouldn’t be watered down because they decided to move to a state with a growing economy. 

I’m honestly super happy you brought these points up because it’s one of my biggest reasons as to why I support the abolition of the electoral college. It would make states stronger and incentivize economic growth and population growth. 👍",2022-04-22 16:02:35

u9c5jp,"When did anyone say poverty was “acceptable”…? Again-what a bizarre take.

You’ve taken figures that examine the whole picture and have chosen to fixate upon the negative extreme. Guess what? There’s a bottom ten percent in every country’s workforce. It’s too bad, but until we all collectively agree upon an exact sum that’s acceptable to retain in assets, that’s how human society works.

“Other countries show that a 13% poverty rate is not necessary”

You mean the countries where said poverty rate sits even lower because the rest of the economy isn’t as healthy as that of America? Cool.

Nobody’s arguing that wealth inequality isn’t an issue. What is being forwarded is the objective truth-America as a whole is ridiculously wealthy, and the vast majority of Americans have it better than the vast majority of the rest of the world.

Feel free to agonize over the impoverished as much as you like; I’ll continue to vote for progressive candidates advocating for a more equitable tax structure and donating to charity while I enjoy the fruits of my labor in this lifetime.

j32bfd,"Looking at the chart tells me that when Obama got into the White House he didn't really understand all the tax loop holes because his first year he was paying $1.8 mil.  Then someone in there obviously helped him out because the following year he payed a little over just $400k.  4.5x less.  Then it looks like he fell off the wagon and started to go back to his old ways again being lazy and had to pay more but the rest of the years he got back on track paying closer to just $50k a year in taxes.

Imagine going from paying $1.8 mil a year to just $50k.  That pretty amazing 👏",2020-10-01 10:56:08

Even if all the people who wanted change in ways that seems super obvious to you (and them) it wouldn’t make a noticeable dent in an election.  The ignorance runs so deep it’s practically hopeless.  I think the only thing that would solicit any meaningful change is for something absolutely terrible to happen that would shake Americans to their core and would force us to rebuild literally from the ashes.  2 perfect examples of how fucked we are here: 1. The election of Donald Trump to president, 2. The way the support for him EXPANDED once he took office while accomplishing absolutely nothing except acting like a donkey in 👏🏽Every 👏🏽Single👏🏽Facet.👏🏽Possible.  We are fucked in so many ways:  Healthcare, Insurance, Education, Banking, Finance, Utilities.... Corporations and business profits take precedent over individuals every time.  However, the real root of all this, and the biggest con of all of them, is the way our election process is organized.  Even if there were an electorate of
like-minded people who wanted to change some of the predatory practices in some of the industries I listed above, AND there was a candidate who would support that change, they would never get elected in the first place.  Corporate funding has both parties by the balls and since we have no third party, if you want to be elected, you have to play by their rules.  If you don’t want to abide by their rules and be an outsider, you have a 0% chance at becoming elected in 99% of the country.

Covid fatalities are not understated when several media outlets have/had a constant death/infection ticker in the corner of their screen. Moreover, deaths were so bad they had to walk back the stat to be “died WITH Covid” not “OF” Covid recently.",2022-01-12 22:09:11
s2at5h,"That's not what I'm saying or what the data is showing; Almost all the people who died ""with covid""(which account for almost all the deaths) is very different than people who died ""from covid"". (Which account for a very very small amount of the deaths)

""With covid"" means that those unfortunate folks fell under the at risk groups of people who were elderly, obese, diabetic, immune disorder etc... this is were all the lives were lost, the vast overwhelming majority.

""From covid"" is where otherwise healthy folks died from just from contracting covid which was very rare to happen. 

The CDC director admitted this to congress this week even though the medical community and numerous governments have known this for almost two years. 

A lot people including politicians are upset about this because it confirms that our governments handled the situation horribly. It was recommended by many studies and medical doctors 2 years ago that we should have put all the efforts, resources and energy into protecting those groups who have died ""with covid"" as those groups account for about 20% of the population. 

Instead the virus was politicized and used to make billions of dollars for already wealthy corporations and people. The lock downs, shutting down of small businesses, vaccine mandate etc didn't make a positive impact, it actually killed more people. 

The world got lied to and manipulated people to be angry at each other while powerful people gained morepower and money... Which is nothing new sadly. 

""You saying they still would have died if Covid didn't exist? This is a terrible argument.""

Those people would have been able to live longer lives if our leaders did the right thing... They didn't sadly because greed is a powerful tool.

s2at5h,"My man, she admitted that they were counting ""with covid"" deaths and ""from covid"" deaths as one category the whole time and that number was used to pressure states into stricter lockdown procedures. Like you said they knew about it but ignored it even though doctors and hospitals were tracking and sending the information to the cdc the last 2 years.

When you purposely skuw one of the most important data points of the whole pandemic to get a certain  output response as to the logical output response the correct data would have recommended just so pharma and other corporations like Amazon could make billions... It's kindy shady. It also led to more deaths.

She also said the vaccines aren't a true vaccine by definition because they don't provide any immunity which has been said by countless people before she said it on national media. She also said masks don't need to be worn by people who have had covid shots despite the fact they can easily spread it still.

She got appointed to the position by president Biden a year ago and it's the 1st government position she's ever held and had no experienced with media interviews or public speaking. So all year she has been making a long list of screw-ups stateing facts that go against what decisions got made throughout this whole thing.

They have been inconsistent with just about everything and it has cost the public a great deal.

Your last question ""Why shouldn't this count as a covid death?"" It does but the huge differences between the two types of deaths (from/with) needs to be accounted for when it's so rare for healthy people to die from covid. Like I said before if we concentrated our efforts to protecting people in the high risk groups from which almost all the deaths accounted for we'd have more of those people alive today.

Something to think about; In the whole western media, that's Australia Europe and the United States n Canada too for every ten conservative media outlets there are 88 left leaning with the last 2 percent including everything else. 🤔  That's papers websites radio magazines corporations and TV. I feel 99% of people don't know that and won't put the time to finding out stuff for themselves.

As I mentioned before their media outlets are in high-level damage control over a numerous amount of things related to the covid virus right now

All that said my main point was about the importance of ""from and with"" covid, the going against the medical community's advice on how to proceed with the handling it and that fact more lives were lost. Also how the economy got crushed while the wealthy got richer.

78fywy,"* We don't have to care about how a number is represented because it is already in base-2 and endianness is irrelevant here. The base used for radix sort is a different type of base than the base of the underlying system. From what I've seen around, octal and hexadecimal are preferred in programs and decimal is used in visualizations. 

* This is why the number of digit places doesn't matter, because we don't care about representing the digits. The only real limiting factor to the runtime is the largest value in the set that will determine the passes required. Which conveniently in unsorted, unstructured data, can also be found in linear time.

* The number of of unique elements doesn't matter, because we are going to apply the modulus operator to determine what counter to increment in the auxiliary array for counting sort. All values will fit into our known base.

* I've been operating under assumption that we're only talking about about radix sort as it applies to fixed size integers. The only reason to use radix + counting at all is that there is an exploitable property of bounded values that can have a modulus operation applied to them. It doesn't make much sense to use it to sort anything else in CS as comparative sorts are much better suited for general purpose sorting.

cdwmb0,"I feel obligated to share my (likely) unpopular opinion on this matter. 

As a man who generally wears slimmer, form-fitting pants I wish that the pockets of these pants were smaller and I understand why this is the case on womens pants which are generally more form fitting. And no, I don't believe it's some patriarchy of men who want to restrict womens ability to travel by themselves or sell more handbags (although handbags are the inevitable solution to having none-functional pockets).

The things I typically carry are my phone, keys, and wallet. My phone and wallet go into my two back pockets when I'm walking around (I take them out to sit down) and I attach my keys to one of my side belt loops with a carribeaner (janitor style 😎).

Over time, even with nothing in my front pockets, the extra bulk of the fabric from the pockets causes pocket-shaped distress marks on the jeans exterior. These distress marks are not quite as ”sightly” as the natural (or pseudo-natural) ones you see impressed on most jeans. Eventually (in less than 6 months) the distress marks become so obvious that I feel uncomfortable wearing the jeans. 

It's not ethical to wear jeans for only 6 months or design jeans to only last 6 months. I believe this is a large reason why jean pockets for women are generally smaller. I wish that slim or skinny fitting men's jeans would have smaller pockets as well. They last longer and remain more aesthetic.",2019-07-16 14:37:38

nh3o3g,"South Korea did well in dealing with COVID-19 in the first year, but we totally dropped the ball in 2021. The administration's strategy for securing doses in advance failed due to mistaken then-future forecasts. Korean citizens didn't have guaranteed access to the doses until mid-March, which eroded our confidence in the administration's reaction which was honestly stellar until then.

And then politics happened. High-ranking officials in the ruling party got caught up in serious and heinous scandals. That party's contender for the presidential election next year (who was held in high esteem) killed himself once it was revealed he'd been sexually assaulting his aides. It turned out that a metropolitan mayor, a provincial governor, &c, all from the same party, had been doing similar things... It was clear that the party was full of horrible hypocrites who tried to cover up each other. 🙄

The media realized that it was finally hip to hate on the administration after all these years. They latched on to vaccine fatalities and harped on about how we didn't get ""the best vaccines"" because the administration is dumb or something. So people's confidence in the administration's COVID-19 response is eroded, the ruling party turned out to be pretty corrupt, and the media is going on a full assault on them with vaccine issues as ammunition...

Since Korea didn't suffer as many COVID-19 fatalities as other countries (thanks to what, I wonder...) the urgent need for nationwide vaccination doesn't seem so critical, apparently.

wb318e,"And this folks is why you see the GOP voting no against a bunch of stuff. Is not that they don’t want to give Americans good things. Its just that they’re very cautious because they know this country doesn’t have money to spend indiscriminately. While Democrats only think on giving without thinking on consequences except “people will be better off, what a great thing we’re doing for people! 😃” then when Republicans vote no they’ll be, “omg, look at Republicans, they voted no towards helping you! they hate you! Don’t vote for them!”.

I’ve always seen it this way.

Democrats are like the kid at the store, wanting everything good it sees. Meanwhile the Republican is like the parent telling the child, “no you can’t have that much candy, is going to cause you a cavity.”

Just FYI. If you venture to learn the mentality of each party instead of being like me when I was in college that would only look at 1 party as if I was part of a sports team. You can learn their reasoning and why each act and decide on what they decide. It can’t be obviously because they’re bad people, there has to be a collective benefit they see towards their constituents. What is that reasoning? Learn that and you will understand each side. What makes sense and what doesn’t. I used to be in the “Good team for the people”. I grew up more and found out, well, you can’t have everything you want in life instantly.",2022-07-30 15:23:44

Emotional coverage. Never showed Olympians on the medal stand. I want to see tears 😭😂. These athletes sacrifice their normal lives to compete every 4 (5) years (or 2 for Eddy Alvarez?) 

Covid coverage. Constantly zoomed in on private conversations athletes are having. This is a new taboo for me.

If you look for example at performance records at the NFL Combine, you see regular Olympic/World Championship level performances in sprints, weights, etc. 

The lure of scholarships worth tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars and potentially millions in pro contracts and endorsements is a VERY large factor, even if the odds remain slim due to the limited number of slots as you rise from one field to the next.

If the Romans had the atomic bomb and everyone knew the immensely destructive power involved, I'd imagine our civilization would have advanced so much more between 500 AD and 1945 AD.

The same thing has repeated over and over again during the centuries.

ib2wsj,"Overall yes, but keep in mind that it depends on the individual case. 

My parents adopted domestically through a private agency but it still took several years, tons of money, and one failed placement before they had a child in their home. There are international adoptions that have gone quicker and smoother than their domestic one did. No one can predict how fast or easy a case will be because each one is different. 

In general foster care adoption is the quickest and cheapest way to get a child in your home. It has a very high failure rate though, and the kids are usually older and come from traumatic backgrounds. The goal of the system is reunification, so you should be open with your caseworker if you are dead-set on adoption because they know which cases are most likely to end in termination of parental rights. If you‘re open to adopting sibling groups or older kids with learning disabilities then case workers will absolutely love you, because these kids are the hardest to place in a home. If you want to adopt from foster care you should have about $5,000 saved up, have a clean home with a bedroom prepared for a child to move in at some point, and be prepared to invest a LOT of time and effort into the child’s psychological needs. This includes meetings with caseworkers, court dates, and doctor/psychologist appointments. You could have a kid in your home within weeks after being approved as a foster home, but if you intend to adopt then the entire process could take years, or worst-case scenario never happen at all. 

If you want a newborn baby with no abuse background or disabilities you’re going to have to shell out a lot of money, pass a rigorous home study, wait a long time, and meet a lot of requirements. These are almost exclusively the domain of private agencies. Adoptions can also be handled between individuals for a much lower cost but I absolutely don’t recommend that, because if that person is a scam artist who runs off with your money then you’ll have no legal protection. If you want to adopt from an agency you should have about $20,000 saved up, have a clean home that is ready for surprise visits from caseworkers at all times, be a married couple (preferably with one stay-at-home spouse), be between the ages of 25-45, have a clean criminal record, and prepare to wait a minimum of a year for a baby. 

International adoptions are mostly the same as private agency ones but they cost more, take longer, and have a failure rate similar to foster adoptions. The majority of international adoptions, at least in the US, are handled by religious organizations that adopt exclusively to people who share their beliefs.

I peeped your profile and saw that you’re serious about adopting from Mexico. I’ll warn you that Mexico is an extremely difficult country to adopt from. Their government will give you no help at all and will make every step of the process difficult. If you’re in the US then you might want to consider adopting a Mexican or hispanic child who is already in the US foster system instead. It’ll be a whole lot easier. 

Good luck in whatever you decide 👍🏻",2020-08-17 06:29:27

1. find 100 ways to explain away this easy look at hard data. 

2. Alternately you will accept that it's accurate but not care a whit as ""climate is cyclical"" and feel that it will correct itself in a few years. 

3. Honestly believe that we are God's favorites and it's ok cause he will fix it.

Die Punkte welche eben solche Zahlen repräsentieren müssten doch, doch sofern ich es richtig verstehe, immer ganz oben sein, oder (wie z.B. bei dem Punkt der für die zwölf steht) ?
also müsste bei jedem zehnerbündel in richtung x Achse mindestens ein punkt ganz oben sein (immer wenn man eine 2 auf der Einer-position hat. bei den zwanzigern sogar zwei, weil 20 und 22). 

Das ist aber soweit ich sehe nicht der Fall. Schon im Bereich 0-9 ist ""die zwei"" zwar im obersten Kästchen, aber eben nur am unteren Rand davon 🤔

Tinder doesn’t capture the timbre of your voice when you’re remembering a story your grandfather told you and sharing it yourself.

So firstly not technically wrong. And even if it was over the margin of 50% that still would leave it at only a 50% chance of you meeting an American on reddit. 

Why is it so hard to take into account the other huge margin on Reddit? Like just appreciate you're not the only country on the internet.

And furthermore, mate, I'm sure if you take subs such as /r/politics which IS a US politics sub then yeah sure you're gonna get a way higher margin. But it's honestly not a big ask for Americans on Reddit to just have a little consideration outside their own country.",2020-04-29 10:08:06

rmv41k,"**Purpose:**  
To investigate if what Pixar Animation Studio movies males prefer more than females (if any).

**Source(s):**  
I used the List of Pixar Animation Studios films [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films#Films). I scraped most IMDB ratings mid-2019, but manually added in the post-2019 movies yesterday. When you have an IMDB account, there is a page that shows you gender demographics and age demographics. IMDB gets these demographics from their IMDB members who have registered with their gender and age.

[Excel Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XBr8Y_pyQsEKrSxM6TeTunVx1cAux-mN/view?usp=sharing) | [Annotated R Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XDLwBLTfAb3bNaury6v49SDa0VM9yqxQ/view)) | [Disney version](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/rlis65/oc_boy_vs_girl_disney_movies/)

**Highlights and Considerations:**

* Females tend to rate movies more favorably than males (Δ = 0.14). I group mean-centered the data (by gender) to see if women still liked Pixar movies more than men after controlling for this small systematic bias.
* Pixar movies are rated higher than the average IMDB rating (Δ = .74), and there are no gender differences in overall ratings for Pixar movies (♂ = +0.74; ♀ = +0.75; p = .92). This means across all movies, males and females like Pixar equally well, but this does not mean that they like all movies equally.
* The popularity of the movies cannot be determined by the graph, only the differences between male and female ratings.
* The average Pixar film rating is 7.7 (the average IMDB score amongst popular movies is 6.9). For comparison, Disney Animation Studios has an average IMDB rating of 7.4.
* The highest-rated Pixar movie is Coco (μ = 8.5) whereas Cars 2 was the lowest-rated (μ = 6.3).
* It seems through a naming convention mismatch between Wikipedia and IMDB, Wall-E was excluded from my data (sorry!). The movie scored a +0.14, showing a moderate preference by males. 

**Formal Statistics:**   
Using a paired t-test, the mean difference between male and female scores (x < 0.01) was not significant (t(22) = -0.10, p < .921). These tests are included in the R code.

**Graphics:**   
I made the graphic in Excel and a few edits and tweaks in PowerPoint.",2021-12-23 13:00:17

Canada. They won't let me in due to a 45 year old felony

Canada. It's just too nice there with nothing to complain about. /s I love you, Canadians

Alabama. Driving from Canada to Florida PCB, the GPS suggested to drive through rural Alabama. There was a section of about 200 miles where I had to drive through swampland with old houses and confederate flags hanging everywhere. We avoided to stop for any reason.and noped out from there as fast as we could

Canada. I’ve been 4-5 times. That’s enough

Canada is the 1 country I will never visit again because if there's a next time.. I'm staying! I don't even care very much where, tho I love Toronto. Would love 2 move 2 Montreal , B.C. sounds great. I hate the cold, no tolerance, but I'd work it out. O Canada 🇨🇦, indeed

This comment section shows how lucky I am to live in my country (Canada) it is annoying how many wars are ongoing. So I am grateful for the life and fortune my mom and dad gave me.

Canada ... would love to visit again, but they won't let me in ..... so never going there again.

Canada, bunch of A-holes. Just kidding, I really like Canada, I just wanted to make the ""A"" joke.

Canada. Not because I don’t like it, but just because the chances are low.

Vatican City. Everything is covered in gold, and the majority of their parishioners live in poverty.... The catholic church promised 25 million for Residential school survivors in Canada about a decade ago. They've provided 5 million and spent 300 million on new churches.

Once I move out, the answer is Canada.

Canada, people are awesome, good local foods, border partrol, I came to buy a car, I had 9k on hand, you searched us for 3 hours, nothing found, let us go, I buy the car, heading home, back toward the bridge in buffalo, before I even get there, I get pulled over, another 2 hours as I get searched again... then newyork side decided to pull the smae shit. this was 2007, so maybe they was still really paranoid, but a fat ass native with a small white guy in a miata coming in and fat native in a concorde exiting.. with paper work, meh soured my stomach.

Canada, because border agents said they will strip searching me if I don’t let them look through my iPhone and give them my password. I gave them the pass code and they took snapshots of my email and everything. I started undressing in the interrogation room just to piss them off and they became really nice and said that wasn’t necessary. They still didn’t let me into the country, so I won’t be giving them my tourist dollars anyway.

Canada. I drove through when moving from Alaska to the lower 48 and I think every person I encountered woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Super racist to my wife and needlessly aggressive to me. I know many Canadians from Ottawa and Nova Scotia that are lovely people. But everyone in Yukon, BC, and Alberta that I met needed to take a chill pill.

omr3x4,"So I'm an egyptian redditor and this is an answer I posted to understand the situation in Egypt.🇪🇬🇪🇬

I'll try to give you a full answer because this is a deep topic. 

There are many factors which led to the massive sexual harassment problem In Egypt. We weren't always like this, til like the 80s women were very respected and free. Then Mubarak took over Egypt, any kind of progress we were making as a country stopped, education  deteriorated to saddening level and poverty just kept getting worse. Fast forward 30 years till the revolution. More than Half of the country is poverty stricken. So how do these poverty stricken people get educated? Many of them don't and those who got one was at an egyptian public school, the worst place to get education in Egypt.so now we are in the present and half of Egypt has received little to no education, religion and tradition steps in. I'm a religious Muslim guy and love my religion but from my experience, religion+ illeducation =SOCIAL NUCLEAR BOMB. Many of the men from this poverty stricken sector( not all, some are very good) turned into testosterone filled idiots who lack basic decency and think they own women. Many women were raised to obey men and accept their abuse 

Till 2020 sexual harassment for many egyptians was usually the woman's fault. To make matters worse women were too scared to actually speak.Thing have taken a great shift now and I'll say why in the end. 

So you ask me but how was tourisim on the rise during Mubaraks Era if things were so bad? Tourists in  Mubaraks Era were basically untouchable, shielded and were treated much better than egyptians ( one of the many reasons of the revolution). They were extremely protected and anyone who would dare touch them would not like what would happen to him.

While Egypt is actually progressing now, the people shaped under the Mubarak Era are still there and security on tourists is currently focused more on preventing terrorism than herrasment. 

What's happening now. The last two years has seen a major crackdown on sexual harassment after a few  big rape scandals rose up in the same time so Egyptians noticed and a massive metoo movement started in Egypt. A reaction to a women getting harassed a year ago is completely different to a reaction of the same thing happening today. It still isn't perfect but is much much better The government is treating it as a serious crime and is held at high regard. Egyptian women are much more brave right now.Even men who got sexually harassed are getting voices now. A very famous egyptian dentist just got a 16 year prison sentence after sexually herrasing his male customers.

So why isn't there a crackdown on the sexual harassment of tourists? Sadly because many egyptians don't think there is any. Like I said egyptians in Mubaraks Era had an idea embedded in their head that tourists basically own the country and can do whatever they want, whenever they want it and no one can touch them. If you ask egyptians on the streets about what they think of the treatment of tourists, they probably would say they want the same treatment.

Is it safe to actually come to Egypt cause now I'm scared? 

Go with a good tourist company or have an egyptian friend and you will be fine and will have an awesome time. I wouldn't recommend going on your own for multiple reasons  not just harassment and if your a women just don't think of the Third option.

What should I do if I get harassed?

Kick their ass ( not physically). Basically threaten them and they'll go running. They don't want a problem with a tourist .
Call the police too if you have too, they are very serious on that matter and will give him a good spanking

You are putting words in my mouth by saying that I think “people’s deaths count for less because a virus killed them” or that “not all deaths are significant”. I never said any of those things.

My issues with this comparison, as I’ve said multiple times, is these number comparisons insinuate that people are bad or wrong for not reacting to covid as they did 9/11. And that’s not fair because the events were different which dictates people’s reactions. 

I live in New York City, where the most deaths happened with both 9/11 and covid. I don’t know your situation but I can guess that I was probably more personally affected by both, and I know people who died in both. Both their deaths are equally significant because they were people. Of course. Nothing I said says otherwise. 

However, 9/11 turned my world upside down in a way that is extremely unique. I was terrified, angry, and deeply sad. While I am all those things for Covid, it has been 9 months. I literally can’t stay “9/11 level” terrified angry and sad about covid. I would kill my self. Everyone I know has been suffering mentally from this pandemic. Expecting people to treat every day like 9/11 because the death toll is the same is unrealistic and judging them for not doing so is frankly cruel. I am not an anti masker or anti vax, and I am deeply disturbed and appalled at the abysmal response this country has had to Covid. But I can’t possibly act like every day is 9/11. I was close to that in March and it was unbearable. I don’t think its fair or right of you to shame people for not having the same reaction to month 9 of a pandemic as they did to waking up one morning to their city being on fire. The situations are different and that shapes how people react. Don’t you dare twist my words to say that that means I think Covid deaths matter less. 

Anyway, this has been exhausting. I gotta go get Covid tested. Just doing my part while you call me an asshole for not doing more. ✌🏻",2020-12-14 14:27:39

Total numbers matter. Per capita numbers matter. That's exactly why I included both, which you acknowledged and ignorantly lied about. So, ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯       
        
> Yes, the US could....blah blah blah....culture matters.     
      
Yes, the US ***could***, but didn't. That was my point. The EU was ***more*** like those countries -- further demonstrating that the US ***could*** also have done better, but again, didn't. But, sure, culture does matter,...which I covered by including ""incompetence, ignorance, *and* politics"". You just ignored the first two. But, to your point, I suppose I should have also added ""arrogance, stubbornness,"" and a few other adjectives.

An actual data graph detailing “lies” is VERY subjective, that’s just my take on it.

k4w1tq,"I think YOU misunderstood the problem 🙂. 

Or maybe you are confusing a hyperloop with a vactrain which is similar to a maglev but on a tube.

Why are maglevs so expensive? Two main reasons: tracks and land.
A maglev train is a large vehicle that needs a massive track system populated with incredibly powerful markets. That is INCREDIBLY expensive, in the others of tens of millions of dollars or km or more, and you have to multiply it by hundreds of km. 
A hyperloop is just a small sealed tube, a few m in diameter, not different from a seamless oil pipeline other than straighter. It needs to be sealed to a vacuum and it has additional infraestructure, but nothing particularly expensive per mile, since unlike a vactrain it doesn't use magnetic levitation, it floats on air skis, which only need a smooth surface to run on. Per mile it's about 100x cheaper than either the maglev.

The land cost is the main source of cost for high speed trains in general. Due to the potential for derailments, high speed trains need an area of a hundred meters or more around each side, or half as much work a massive dirt and stone hill. In the west at least such area can be very expensive, e.g. in California om it was assessed to be over 100M dollars per mile not counting populated areas. A maglev might be assessed to need less clearance of the possibility of a derailment is proven to be minimal, but at least for now regulatory issues require the same clearance for a massive open air high speed vehicle. Since a hyperloop is sealed and the vehicle can't escape the tube and since it is smaller it only needs a few tens of meters around each side, and the trains and tube are much narrower than a train, so on straight areas it can be laid on small pylons between the lanes of any highway. That makes it 30x cheaper so secure the land, or even cheaper in areas with straight highways.

The hyperloop train size also makes things cheaper since instead of hundreds of times each vehicle is just a few tons, which simplifies the whole infrastructure.

Given the lack of experience there are likely unknown costs to the hyperloop, but the known costs of the maglev do not apply to the hyperloop.",2020-12-02 17:11:28

8gq5gq,"Valid point. But regardless of any temperature changes (which are definitely huge aspects of climate change) the impact of increased CO2 levels on our oceans alone should be cause for panic.

Photosynthetic bacteria in the ocean account for upwards of 70% of the oxygen produced in our atmosphere. If ocean acidification continues and our ocean ecosystems degrade enough, not only will we millions starve from lack of food, but if those bacteria start dying off and if our oceans die then regardless of anything else humanity as we know it is pretty fucked.

But you are right, we don’t know exactly what temperature the climate is “supposed” to be, but I see that as mostly irrelevant for now because first we have to get CO2 levels under control. Then (assuming these kinds of changes are reversible) the temperature and climate should work itself back to “normal.”

If it doesn’t, then we would need a good answer to that question. 👍🏻",2018-05-03 17:36:19
8gq5gq,"I see where you’re coming from and I do appreciate the optimism, but there’s that voice in the back of my head that while we may get some positives like that, there is also an increased possibility of droughts in other areas.

In fact I truly believe the oceans will be the main casualty of climate change if it’s allowed to progress as it is. Because you’re right, the land that we know has not always been as it is and is more durable to change, yet the changes in our ocean chemistry are far less precedented and it’s hard to imagine there being a secondary positive. It won’t matter if we get new plants in North Africa if our oceans die (marine Cyanobacteria account for up to 70% of the world’s oxygen for example, compared to the rainforests that provide ~30%) or if fish die because their sensory organs don’t work in acidic conditions (look up ph affects on Shark hunting capabilities).

Here’s hoping we find solutions and that the doomsday scenarios don’t come tru 👍🏻",2018-05-03 18:56:21
8gq5gq,"It’s okay, we’ve all done it 😂

But idk if the free market approach will work for this because in the short term going green is “costly” and sometimes difficult. And if the primary motivator is profit and short term stability then the free market will produce little of value in terms of benefit to the environment. (Despite the fact that long term costs are reduced by going green).

The reality is that the sooner we get green policies moving the better. And while this gif is dramatic, it doesn’t even address the more startling and potentially dangerous effects of climate change (the death of our ocean due to acidification from increased CO2).

This is a situation where it almost certainly is better to act in a timely manner, the possible benefits far outweigh any risks of becoming more efficient with our resources. I honestly don’t understand why people are so hesitant, besides the normal resistance to change and the money of the fossil fuel industry.",2018-05-03 18:25:30

hpol2c,"I started the pandemic in Ireland where I have to say we handled the outbreak almost exemplary and have now almost 0 deaths and 0 new cases for the last two weeks or so. 

I then had to travel to Mexico for 14 days to “quarantine” as the US had placed a travel ban on Ireland and the Schengen countries in Europe 

Mexico handled the outbreak in a way that I would call not the best but there were certainly precautions taken, my temperature was taken on both sides of the flight, and face masks and face shields were commonplace on public transport and a requirement in all shops, there cases were still on the rise and I believe they reopened too early and have now seen a 180% increase in cases since I left.

After my 14 days quarantine in Mexico I travelled to the absolute epicenter of the virus in Phoenix, Arizona where I can safely say that “handling” the virus is close to non existent. No mask requirements, restaurants still open as normal up until last week where the governor put in an order to reduce capacity to 50% which was apparently already being put in place by the restaurants themselves. Antimaskers and karens are commonplace and this data shows that perfectly. 

The US has made a complete mess of the situation, not only have they not listened or learned anything from the rest of the world, it feels as though they have actively tried to go the opposite direction.

You should see some of the polls in the book *Factfulness* by Hans Rosling.

It's a definite read recommendation for everyone 😀

I'm sure there was more than few parties fighting for and against the flag, that's just the parties I'm aware of. Most of the non-alts I creeped turned up as Americans though that was the minority of accounts, so I'm not sure and it doesn't really matter.

ov1v3q,"For a Data Is Beautiful post, the methodology and presentation are both stupid ugly.

This presentation looks like two likeness dimensions, with right and down both representing improvement, but it's not. There was only one ""likeness"" score assigned, and then each attempt was laid out L-R, wrapping at the end of a row.

Look: supposedly 20% of logos are ""near-perfect."" Where is that 20%? It's the bottom rows, not almost whole the bottom right quarter, and certainly not the rightmost columns. Not do the rightmost columns represent correct color or bite location.

Look: Compare the leftmost in the 4th row from the top, with the rightmost in the third row. You'll see that the former is a better representation, being pretty good in all but color. In fact, it's the best of the red logos.

Color correctness was arguably over-weighted, too: compare R4C1 to what comes after.

People don't always remember that contagious diseases are a mostly local phenomenon, and that even though we aggregate a lot of statistics to the country level, you can't actually infect someone in Oregon when you're in Florida, for example. 🙂",2021-08-01 21:27:55

On the other hand, last spring, when they started spending money on vaccines, they were hoping for 50% efficacy. That was the bar to clear. What the data continues to show is that of the people in the hospital, it is--in the high 90's % unvaccinated people. And the dead ones from Covid, definitely 99% unvaccinated. 

I don't give a shit if I get Covid and it feels like a cold/flu. 🤷‍♂️ That is by and large what the people in the CDC data released this week were feeling like.",2021-08-01 16:43:24

z3g4e4,"Infrastructure is a huge part of becoming a host for such an event. in principle: When it is promised in the bid, it goes into the cost for the WC. this goes for any prospected host.

when a bidding host country has a metro already, but the station is not big enough for such an event and maybe dont have enough wagons, they promise FIFA that they will expand the station and buy new wagons. Both go into the plan for the bid and as such, into final costs. The rest of the metro, since it wont need to be built, wont be on the final bill - but the expansion of the station and buying the new wagons will be.

When a bidding host city/country has no means to transport visitors with suitable public transport (PT) they have zero chance to get the event. if they promises FIFAhowever that they will build PT for the event, it goes into consideration for the bid, and onto the bill.

Qatar
>The transport plan, in line with the hosting 
concept, differs from transport models of past 
FIFA World Cups™ due to the fact that all key 
venues are situated in close proximity to one 
another. Signifi cant development is planned for 
both the New Doha International Airport and the 
general transport infrastructure. Nevertheless, 
the fact that ten out of the 12 stadiums are 
located within a 25-30km radius could represent 
an operational and logistical challenge. Any delay 
in the completion of the transport projects could 
impact FIFA’s tournament operations. 

Japan
>Japan has an excellent transport infrastructure, 
comprising numerous international and 
national airports and extensive road and rail 
networks. However, traffi c-reduction measures 
are essential to increase capacity and facilitate 
event transport operations during peak times.

We are born with all the eggs we'll ever have. But we don't use even a fraction of them over our fertile window. It will depend on what birth control you're on, but some cause a follicle to form but without an egg. So in that sense, you're not 'wasting an egg'. Others prevent implantation so then you are 'wasting' an egg. But you have so many, a million i think at birth, by time you start menstruation a few hundred thousand, it's mostly other factors that determine 'egg wastage'. You'll only ever actually release a couple hundred over your fertile window.

I don't think adding padding to the playground counts here... 😓 ",2018-03-02 06:43:04
81axoz,I graduated in 96 and remember the big deal was that someone had been shot the year just before I started 😖,2018-03-02 14:51:41
81axoz,I'm 37 and I feel the same way! When I graduated from high school people were not getting shot 😖,2018-03-02 14:35:04
81axoz,Me too. Obviously. Cheers mate. 🍻,2018-03-02 09:47:01

t4hyik,Get ride of all the nukes now by throwing them into the sun 😂,2022-03-02 10:21:44
t4hyik,At least there are fewer than there used to be 😓,2022-03-02 11:53:02
t4hyik,I wonder what mindset the Soviets had that they thought over 30k nukes was a good idea😅 surely they knew just 1 was too many,2022-03-02 12:11:25
t4hyik,Mmmmm I kind of doubt North Korea has 50🤣,2022-03-02 14:34:01
t4hyik,Iran next inshallah. More Muslim countries with nuclear weapons inshallah💪💪,2022-03-02 14:57:17
t4hyik,My grandmother still believes we will find it. 😭,2022-03-02 02:15:18
t4hyik,"I’m actually fine with Israel having them. They have lots of enemies for such a small country. Major military powers like Iran that think Israel shouldn’t exist. So yeah a deterrent is good. 

And it’s not like they’re gonna nuke Palestine 💁‍♂️",2022-03-02 13:52:56
t4hyik,"🤔 Interesting, but to what end? Like, what would be the point of having secret nukes? It seems like in many ways their whole reason for existing, their utility, is to not be secret.",2022-03-02 11:39:56
t4hyik,"Russia threatening the world with nukes and you still have idiots that think that the Western world maintaining their nukes is ‘wastage’.

You people are honestly so stupid😂",2022-03-02 08:20:27
t4hyik,"It's hard for me to imagine them spending money on nukes. Russia has a difficult time with mass production. Ironically though, they are the second-largest seller of arms in the world. That's a lot of AK-47s. 😆",2022-03-02 03:36:52

Ah, there it is ✔️

This graphic makes it apparent how the NAZI's were able to come to power due to a general lack of press on their activities in the 1920's and 1930's.
