6cgif5,"I know how you feel. My older siblings would force me to watch horror movies and then throw me into a walk in closet that, as a kid, looked like a small room. They would carry that on for a few mins until they heard me screaming for my life basically. My dad would some times catch them having to much ""fun"" with me, but never really did anything. He hated when I would cry though, he threw me up against the wall once because I wouldn't (couldn't) stop crying. What made the mental torture even worse is that I lived deep in the country where the house next to you isn't even visible, and the only light outside was the porch light. I grew up in confused fear because I couldn't ever really remember a time I wasn't scared of something. So, my future has always followed my past. Here recently, he wanted to talk to me and my sister (she's the only girl out of my dads 5 kids, and the second youngest. Im the baby) about why he was a bad father. Turns out, my family is all kinds of fucked up. I never had a chance to figure that out because when I was maybe 8, me and my sister went to go live with our mom. As I got older I distanced myself more and more from my dads side of the family. Anyway, he told me about his upbringing and his attempted suicide. Of course he went into detail and some stuff, but he basically wanted to give the main reasons why he was a bad father. There is still a lot of talking to be done, but it's a start for him and it's a start for me. It helped me realize why my siblings were such assholes and why my dad was so angry, as was my mom. It helped me realize why the people that were apart of my everyday life were such a negative impact on me. I keep falling down, but I always get back up. I'm a curious person so I'm always ""investigating"" what knocked me down. I learn, I write it down in my notebook, and then I find a solution. I've come to the conclusion in order to seek happiness in life, I am going to have to accept myself. Growing up in fear has a lot of self hate behind it, and those are both negative emotions. It all comes down to realizing when you're being negative and being positive. Trying to be positive at 22 is hard. There has been so much that has happened in my life that I am trying to comprehend already and now I've realized I need to let the past die. Not all of it of course, but a massive piece. My life is a crazy fuckin roller coaster, and I'm finally learning to have fun while making it a memory. Life wasn't meant to be perfect. It's a physiological test and you're in control! We can't live in denial. The truth will honestly set you free, and patience is taking advantage of time. JUST DO IT! ✌🏼",2017-05-21 17:49:23

chfy7h,"MORE MYCO FACTS ABOUT THIS BAD BOY:

Cool genetics! This species is called polymorpha (i.e. multiple forms) because the same fruiting body performs two types of reproduction; sexual -- when it  meets and mates with another compatible fungus -- and asexual (no need for a mate, just proliferate!) 

This stage has a relatively light color, indicating a lot of asexual spore production. They can eventually grow to be thicker and almost jet black in color, signifying the transition to sexual spore production.

BONUS FACT: The sexual stage is referred to as the ""Teleomorph,"" while the asexual stage is the ""Anamorph."" These can look and behave so differently from each other in some fungi that they've been given entirely different names!

8ys873,"Bananas make great conditioner that helps restore dry, damaged hair. Mash a banana and add a tablespoon of heavy cream and a tablespoon of honey to the mixture. Then apply it to dry hair, cover your hair with a shower cap, and then wrap your head in a warm towel. Leave it on for up to an hour and then rinse thoroughly with warm water before shampooing.

I understood then that running 10km races, arduous hikes etc were mere child’s play in terms of tenacity and endurance.

Unfortunately, I had to get a C section in the end but the midwives told me I was one of the toughest clients they had ever had, to keep fighting for so long.

What you’re describing might actually be a spider species, they are also harmless (can’t bite) but aren’t harvesters, and instead have the segmented body and fangs of spiders. The fangs are just too small for humans, and venom too weak to cause any determinable effect either.

bc3box,"Ok’ Sparky was the last chair to be used in the US, in Huntsville Texas.  My father worked for TDC and had gruesome details of chair mishaps.

As prior stated, burns to the brain 🧠 (more like broiling) was the major caused of death 💀.  BUT a wet sponge needed to be placed underneath the head shocker, which was deliberately “forgotten” for inmates disliked by TDC guards.  These wet sponges 🧽 sped up process, but the hair needed to be shaved on the head’s top.  To be extra cruel, guards left a full head of hair and forgot the sponge.

Another matter is that mask : the head explodes.  This was not a problem for the guards but witnesses left covered in organs was a PR issue and health code violation.  The mask retained the facial organs.  Some particularly vindictive families requested the mask be removed, to see the suffering of the condemned, but all lived to regret their spite.

Lastly, the smell of burnt human flesh never left those chambers.  It becomes embedded in the walls and floor.  All of their “last meal” - half digested - would pour out onto the floor, from every orifice.  Imagine walking into a room, with the smell of poop, vomit, burnt skin, cooked hair and charred teeth, knowing that is where you work.",2019-04-12 09:15:35

The discovery is the oldest, most intact, most genetically complete human remains ever found in the new world (and their existence suggests we’ve been here longer than we thought).

mwropm,"Yes! Yes you do! The forces on the cervical spine drastically increase with increases in cervical spine flexion. In other words the longer one let's their shoulders and neck to fold forward the harder it gets to correct...every day it is compounded due to increased weakness in the cervical spine extensors/shoulder retractors and tightness in the cervical spine flexors and the anterior chest musculature. Computers, cell phones, tablets...have drastically increased the amount of time we spend in cervical flexion that abnormal curvature is already being identified in the youth of the world due to the prominence of technology and lack of physical education.

Edit: I apologize for the PSA. It falls right in line with my work/profession so I was unable to stop once I started typing 😬

Edit 2: I will also add that all of the above is even more important for women due to the risk of decreased bone density post menopause. From my childhood in the 80's I remeber distant female relatives without any ability to look 5 feet in front of them due to the drastic flexion curvature in their cervical and thoracic spine. This was due to not knowing decreased bone density was an issue for post menopausal women and therefore doing nothing mechanically to resist the forces and there were no hormone or osteoblast increasing medications being used for this purpose.

TLDR: Our heads are heavy and the resulting lever arm effects of gravity  on the neck drastically increase the more we tilt our heads forward. We need to fight this with exercise or we will be paying the price. The fight is even more important for females.",2021-04-23 10:35:59

937u5i,my aesthetic 👹,2018-07-31 06:57:04
937u5i,"It's just in it's early concept idea at the moment but after really enjoying Event Horizon I had this thought that there are many films that include objects or places that are actually portals between our world and hell, one of the things that made me think this was the crew of the Event Horizon and how they were in a lot of ways similar to the Cenobites of Hellraiser I then started to think that this could also be the case for the creatures in Silent Hill, born of fear, pain and loss of innocence as well as having a following that see them as gods. I started to piece together other films that also follow the design that hell exists as a real place and that there are ways for it and it's inhabitants to cross over from their plain of existence into ours via objects (the Lament Configuration, the Lasser Glass, the Necronomicon, etc) or places (Silent Hill, the tunnel in Absentia, the tree between worlds in Sleepy Hollow, etc) or man made objects (Basilius' Machine, the Antonia Grazia from Ghost Ship, the Catacombs of Paris in As Above So Below, the Event Horizon) and even through belief (The Cult in The Void, The Shephard in The Dark, etc) and that these films, even though inherently different, do seem to have the same vein of thinking and that from this they are all linked. Humans have been inherently drawn to the idea of heaven and hell, good and evil since as far back as the bible maybe even further and this manifests itself in cinema, books, art, even sometimes sadly real life......... oh uh I guess you heard more about it. Lol. Sorry... got on a tangent there. Enjoy. 😁",2018-07-31 16:58:22

76h0lm,"We’ve got a lot of recordings of paranormal stuff and UFOs, but as with pretty much any picture (or other media), it’s easy to just dismiss. I myself have seen actual saucers, probably 200’ from me (and my bro), 30’ over the ground, on a bright sunny day. Despite this, everyone tells me about how I didn’t see them. They offer the same explanations, and none have made any sense. 

The standard for proving this stuff seems to be higher than for anything else, but to be fair there are a lot of lies and false stuff out there.

amrpjo,"Thank you so much. I didn’t think posting his face was appropriate for Reddit or something his father would be comfortable with, so I blurred. He is super cute though 😄. His smile motivates me so much. 

Not a hurtful question whatsoever. His head had gotten pretty big fairly quick when I was pregnant with him due to the fluid build up and his soft spots in his head basically were stretched out from it. Once the fluid was removed, it allowed his brain matter to fluff out and he did look pretty awkward for a moment while we waited for his soft spots to close up and harden. 

I felt really shamed by stares and comments we would get if I took him into public, and I also felt guilty for feeling the way I did by complete strangers because my son is the most important person in my life; I’d do absolutely anything for him to make sure he feels he has 100% of my attention, affection and unconditional love. Hell, I felt so guilty for putting hats on him when we would leave the house..but people can just be so mean—I didn’t know how else to protect him or my emotional well-being. His first year was a huge growing point for me as a mother and I’m always thinking of how I can make him feel more confident that he is who he is.

I think I’m on the right track though. His fav book is called, “I Like Myself”, and it warms my soul when he brings it to me and says, “I’m glad I’m me, mama! No one else I rather be! Read I’m glad I’m me? Please?”

jtgux3,"My grandmother (on my dad's side) had the same thing when I was a kid, and my last memory of her was my dad playing guitar and singing for her, she couldn't say much at all at this point but she was definitely trying to sing along, and I could tell she was enjoying it. It was sad but also beautiful in a way, it wasn't long after that she passed away. 


I don't know if this will help at all but there are moments when you can know for sure its still them inside. You're right that It's cruel, unfair and brutal, and I can't begin to imagine that happening to my  own mother so I cant compare that to what you're going through, but what I mean is I'm sure you will still have moments with her that you can cherish.

For Christ sake I’m not writing an essay. I’m on mobile and it does weird things sometimes. The fact that you couldn’t understand what I was trying to say speaks volumes about you.

bt6r2n,"An insane person runs down the street. He insists there are face eating monsters after him. Monsters no one can see but him. But since he sees them, he knows them to be real. He runs and runs, trying to warn others of the danger, but no one believes him and they tell him he’s wrong. But because of a Wikipedia entry, he knows that what they say are invalid. He knows that just because many people say something doesn’t make it true. After all, he can see the monsters just a block away, and they seem to be gaining fast!

According to you, I can claim that 1+1=3  because everyone saying it doesn’t doesn’t make it true. You ask me if I went to school... So I assume your finished with school, spending your day on the internet showing all those dumb, insecure Redditors who’s boss?
 
You’ve obviously never used a phone with AUTO-CORRECT on before. It does whatever it wants to. Grow up and stop acting too proud to see your failure. I can’t believe I’ve let you draw me into this like this 🙄. You nitpick every detail because your so damn insecure about your own intelligence you have to insult everyone else’s based on shit they do ON THE INTERNET and AUTO-CORRECT.

“So how’d you know it’s danger in the first place? And why would you run? Why would nature magically assume wanting to keep living?”

This is your original comment. Do you really, REALLY not understand why nature would “magically assume wanting to keep living?” You know how genes are passed down, right? Did YOU even go to school? It certainly doesn’t sound so. They probably didn’t ‘know’ it was danger, but rather perceived it as danger. They could have perceived it as danger because of a million different things. What they perceive as danger could also be warped because they’re children. And nature would obviously “magically assume wanting to keep alive” to pass down that organism’s genes. It’s how evolution works, bud. If organisms didn’t feel a need to pass down genetic data, then what other purpose would there be for it?",2019-05-27 09:56:02

70v3n8,"When I was there in 2007 it must have been different then because there was barely any lighting (80% of it was pitch black), no supervision, no railing or protection between the bones, no signs of recent civilisation, nothing. Just that initial spiral staircase and then boom, you're utterly alone. 

Somewhere in the gloom ahead of us was an older french lady translating for her english friend and was reading aloud some of the french inscriptions that are in various places down there. Her voice carried far but seemed directionless, so every now and then we would hear coming from nowhere in the dark an old woman's voice echoing things like ""... Blessed is he who keeps the hour of death in sight, and who spends his days ready to die"". 

It was one of the most ""real"" experiences of my life. I loved every second of it, even if it was creepy.

We also found an empty dark room where some ghost hunters had set up heaps of equipment to ""detect"" if there was any supernatural activity. They looked like a film crew until we saw their stuff didn't look like any sort of camera i'd seen so I started talking to them. 

I've heard vandals messed the place up and scattered all the bones and they've had to totally change things to suit all the new foreign tourists visiting due to that recent movie. I'll always have my memories and photos though 💀",2017-09-18 18:59:55

70v3n8,"**Heart (symbol)**

The heart shape (♥) is an ideograph used to express the idea of the ""heart"" in its metaphorical or symbolic sense as the center of emotion, including affection and love, especially (but not exclusively) romantic love.

The ""wounded heart"" indicating love sickness came to be depicted as a heart symbol pierced with an arrow (Cupid's), or heart symbol ""broken"" in two or more pieces.

dguj6n,"Reminds me of a [bloodoak](https://theedgechronicles.fandom.com/wiki/Bloodoaks) from The Edge Chronicles.

""By itself, the bloodoak was incapable of ensnaring prey. The prey was actually caught by the tarry vine, a symbiotic growth on the bloodoak consisting of long, mobile tendrils. The tendrils of the tarry vine wrapped around the prey, reeled it in like a fishing line, dangled it above the bloodoak's mouth, and dropped it in. If a tendril was severed, three new ones sprouted in its place, though this could be prevented by cauterizing the tendril stump with a flame.

Once the bloodoak swallowed its prey, the creature was crushed inside the trunk. The bloodoak devoured the creature's flesh, and the tarry vine drank its blood.

""The roots of bloodoaks acted like veins, pumping a dark, rich, bloodlike sap.""

6n9iu9,"No worries, i could fill a novel with psychedelic experiences 😂, that really sounds amazing, i smoked one more time after that, and i came so close to a proper ego death, like forgetting who you are, your wants, desires, likes and dislikes, and becoming one with everything, i felt my body slowly disintegrating into the vastness of the universe, usually orgasmic but less like sensory based, and more feeling based, you know? There were little bits of my body i could still sense and feel. I was with my friend and we had smoked the rest of this roach, and i remember laying there listening to the music, letting the drugs blow my fucking mind, god the shit i was seeing was so beautiful. And BAM, dark memories from my past start filling my visions and its game over, everywhere i looked was practically hell, i made it though it and that was the last time i took acid.. that was a year ago. 

Im thinking about doing it again next week, i feel like i need to take baby steps, so im only gonna take a tab, and not smoke weed. And see where it takes me. Thanks for this exchanging of stories, its honestly so interesting to hear about other's psychedelic experiences ",2017-07-14 18:21:16

I squirted them before they were in kicking range and they spooked and be parted quickly. I got three at home so I am not thrilled to feed more when on vacation.

Even worse if seaweed brushes by as I'm swimming

5p3lhb,"I am sooooo happy that I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm absolutely terrified of the possibility that something much larger than me could be swimming right by me and they happen to brush against me. Sweet fuck, just the thought is enough to make me wanna leave a Hershey Kiss deposit where I stand (float? Idk). 

Just to give you an idea of how scared and anxious I get when dealing with ocean shit: even in video games I freak the fuck out when there's under water stuff to do. When I was a kid, Super Mario 64's level, Dire Dire Docks had me shitting a brick castle. And on top of that, there's a sunken ship *AND A GIANT EEL THAT WANTS TO EAT YOU!!* 
I've also played this Tomb Raider game where at the damn start of the game, Lara has to free dive down into the deep dark ocean and to get to this under water  structure. On top of all that, there are sharks that are swimming around and yes, they like to take a bolting swim towards you. 

Fuck that on every level, ok? 

It may seem silly, but I'm petrified of sharks. Great Whites the most. Those huge black orbs for eyes, the way their teeth jut out when they go to take a bite of something, gosh!!  No, no, no and no again. Not to mention the almost drowning accident when I was little. 🌊🐳🐬🐙",2017-01-23 18:25:42

2sij3c,"Firstly there are 73 books in the Catholic bible and each one should be read differently. Some of these books are historical and others are filled with allegory and metaphors. So all of these books are comprised of truth but not all of them are written and interpreted as a historical or scientific book would be.

I understand your point but you are missing something. You are acknowledging that we all have free will and that God still punishes us for committing sin (Hell). You are also saying that God will punish us even though he created us knowing we would commit these sins in the first place. So lastly I presume you are saying that because God created us knowing that we will sin he is responsible for the sins we commit. Would having children not be the same way? Parents obviously aren't as omniscient as God is but they still know their child will do things wrong as they live their life. Despite this fact people still want to have children. God creates children and they are pure and innocent and our world corrupts them. Notice God did not corrupt Adam and Eve; Satan did. I hope I was able to clarify. ☺ If you need more clarification I willing to help.

y31crp,"This is most likely a charnel house. See, in the middle ages, it was popular to be buried in the church's graveyard. It's prime real estate for important dead folks. Problem was, graveyard space was a limited resource. So people were buried for five years, give or take, allowing time for full decomposition. Then they were dug up and the graveyard space was re-used. 

The bones themselves were stored in a lot of ways. Some churches went full ""Memento Mori"" and built ossuaries, chapels built from the bones of their benefactors. Some churches stored them in the basement. Some, looking at you Paris, built massive catacombs. (Remembering that Europe lost 30-50% of the population to waves of the plague. Reasons why vaccines are awesome!) 

In short, next time you drive past a cemetery, be glad your grandmother is probably not going to be disturbed. At least, not during your lifetime. ☠️🖤",2022-10-14 02:12:18

-Tour of a bunker drilled into a mountainside. Part of a tour was a room with the audio of constant shelling. I was sick after 2 minutes. 
-Forest areas that had signs indicating where buildings of villages once were. Splattered with holes from bombings of the time. 
-Rows and rows of hundreds of soldiers' graves from all war parties. Overwhelming sadness at loss of all these lives


And then the basement of this huge war memorial. It was shocking to see the undeniable evidence again. 


And then some asshole felt the need to do it all again, and worse, about 20 years later. 

Makes me wonder what humankind could achieve if we channeled war efforts into something productive. 🤷‍♀️",2022-10-14 01:34:39

gp66pp,"I used to get sleep paralysis a few times per week.

Sleep paralysis basically is when your brain wakes up, but your body is still asleep, and the part of the brain responsible for creating dreams is still active. This results in you being awake, in your bed and suddenly feel something climb on your bed, or breathe next to your ear, or you just hear your door opening and hear footsteps but you can’t react. There is also the more extreme version where this happens with your eyes open and you actually get to see ghosts, thiefs, angels, monsters etc in your room, and they seem 100% real. The scariest part is that you don’t wake up after these dreams. You are already awake. You just get to start moving after a while, so you think what you witnessed was 100% real 

So yeah, I guess I had to actually use my technique in reality to help me sleep at night :) I can’t move so I tell myself they can’t harm me, until I can move. It stopped happening after a while btw 😅",2020-05-24 08:48:20

8xogas,"Hey JMac 👋 I just wanted to say that you’re not alone. I was holding my mothers hand as she passed as well, I’m not sure how long it’s been for you, but 18 years for me. 

I’ve become emotionally detached because of it, i guess if you choose not to love, you cant lose.  Slowly I’m learning to open up and let others in, but that worry will always be there, you just have to pick whats more important to you, living right here, right now, or holding on to something that will always be an anchor if you let it.

I won’t say it gets better, the memory still remains, but the impact and weight of it gradually eases where you can think about her and not immediately flash back to *that* moment.

Anyway, hope you hang in there, theres still sunny days ahead my friend.

f1439b,"This reminds me of when I worked at some apartments over 10 years ago. One holiday season a guy decided murder suicide was how he wanted to go. The aftermath was disturbing, to say the least. 

This image seems eerily similar, she was killed while wrapping Christmas gifts, the blood left behind was all over the place. But the blood where her body laid, had drained all over the carpet.

The only thing the company hired to clean up was in charge of, was removing as much blood as possible...

f1439b,"Absolutely not. It only takes about a week. Water speeds up the decomposition process and creates a Breeding ground for bacteria and insects. The body will bloat in a couple days. Usually about 3 in humid and moist climates. Then 5-6 days it’ll burst and all that blood and fluid will seep out. Now in about 7-8 days you have a black/brown/yellow body soup marinating

Governments used to use them a great deal years ago so add them to the list of suspects (last tenant, landlord.)   Their motors are a bit noisy and this compartment would only amplify its noise so this setup isn't optimal I would think.  They're available today in good, used condition for around $50 in working condition.  Specs: High speed wide range pan tilt head, integrated 12X high speed auto focus zoom lens, 2/2 auto tracking and motion detection, fully controllable remotely via RS-232C VISCA™, or with supplied IR Remote Commander.

The cloned animal protein concept is currently in the developmental stages, but this idea is certainly possible. We’re in the trial stages at the moment, but give it a little more time to become sustainable and ethically acceptable, and we will all be eating version 15,546 of Bessy the cow. 

Cheap to mass produce, sustainable, requires little to no feed/water to nourish these clones, environmentally friendly, nutritionally enhanced, can be produced at a much faster rate than the fiercely controversial contemporary mass production methods.  I envision animal proteins that appear to be amorphic in appearance and grown in tanks, hooked up to cables that deliver nutrients and steroidal concoctions and sensors that monitor growth, oxygenation levels, and nutrient balances (similar to the bacta tanks from the Star Wars books).

3ks30v,"I've never understood depression because I myself get over things all too easily. 
What makes me wonder with this condition is, how are people who are depressed the seriously that have to hind themselves so they can function in society trust themselves? 
Is being depressed like being asleep, to where you are not conciliatory but viewing yourself in a 3rd person? 
Is depressions the same as just feeling low energy? 
I live with a 14 year old, whom is my niece. My mother her biological grandmother, whom has legal custody of her, has been through the ringer with this child and I have myself. 
It seems that she's always stressed and immediately responds with aggression and annoyance. I've ways been told growing up that woman are expected to be like this? This makes no sense to me and may be attributed to why I don't date or seek close relations often with women and to clarify with men either. (Kiss my ass, suckers😆)
I try and tell her that if she wants to better herself she needs to see herself as better and build herself up. Not sure if this information makes it through to her head but I will be strong for her. ",2015-09-13 22:07:36

when doctors realized that The only thing keeping his body Even the slightes alive where the machines, they talked to the Family to get the aproval to turn them off, as there was no way left to save Him.

Edit 1: Thanks for the silver KIND STRANGER!


Edit 2:I'm gonna tell my mother and whole family immediately, this is my greatest achievement.

Edit 3: OMG a helpful award too??????

Edit 4:I've been evicted for trying to use 2 reddit awards as an equivalent exchange for this month's rent. Society.

Edit 5: I've managed to hole myself up in a stranger's basement, and I've noticed another helpful award! I'd scream and piss myself in excitement, but I don't want the man currently upstairs to hear that I'm down here and kick me out.

Edit 6: I've been on the run for 2 days now. Apparently it's a crime to shit in someone's kettle, and it was also the thing that tipped him off that I was illegally living in his basement. Not my fault he was in the bathroom and I really needed to go. That being said, I may try to bribe a policeman with the FOURTH award and second silver I've been gifted. Thanks so much kind stranger! I'll update once I've done it.

Edit 7: Managed to sell my anal virginity in exchange for a chance to use the phone. Gus, the person who runs this prison told me that I still had one thing left to sell. I'm afraid to find out what it is. Even though this has been hell, it's ALL worth it for this. I can't believe it. Yet another unbelievably kind stranger has gifted me a WHOLESOME award. I'll make sure to scream about Big Chungus whenever I get parole. Wholesome 100.

Edit 8: After becoming the prison cumslut, the giards decided to join in and I managed to buy my way out with my nostril virginity. So glad to have escaped that hellhole. And my out-of-jail present is ANOTHER award???? I must track down this kind stranger immediately and suck his dick, Jah knows I have practice with that by now.

Edit 9: So it turns out living homeless isn't as easy as I originally thought. Firstly, I can't sell my body anymore since no one's interested in getting with a man who hasn't showered in approximately 8 weeks. Food is scarce, I've entered several delirious bouts due to malnutrition as of late. I don't know how I'm gonna get out of this one. I really need a hug or something. But I just noticed, yet another kind stranger has given me a HUGZ award???? Maybe my family will take me back if I show them how epic and wholesome I am on Reddit!

Edit 10: I don't know how long I can keep living like this. I just got thrown out of a gym for attracting rodents with the smell of rotting flesh covering me. I tried to steal some money from a guy, ended up getting beaten up and left in an alleyway. All my food got taken by some hungry squirrels. I'm losing it. I traded my very last spider in a jar for access to a phone right now. And suddenly, I notice I've received another HUGS award from some kind stranger! I'm elated. Maybe I COULD go live in the forest and be one with nature...

Edit 11: I did not expect living off the land to be so difficult. My only sustenance for days has been cockroaches and the occasional grasshopper I could catch.  Couldn't even catch the damn squirrels that stole all my food. I'm at the end of my rope here. I tried building a tree house but it broke and I fell out of it in my sleep. For now, I've fashioned a radio and flip phone from the remains of am abandoned laptop I found. And you're telling me I got a HELPFUL award too? These kind strangers give me hope.I'll go scrounge up some roaches for dinner.",2021-01-25 01:56:47

km6c2w,the comments on this post where literally 666😧.but now they are 667😄😃🥳,2021-01-14 02:55:03
km6c2w,"Does anyone know where to find the documentary that shows the events.
As I have seen it many times, but I'm pissed as everytime coming up to the point where Dave and Deon's bodies are pulled up, and then finally pulled ip onto ground which the camera definately captures footage of both Deon and David's Body's on the surface.
So the camera caught the moment where everyone saw David's dead body and face etc, as well as Deon's Ten year old Corpse now on dry land and captured what he looked like after that prolonged period.
I know it was captured as the camera keeps focus on the two bodies when dragged up to the beach land area where their faces were exposed to everyone, as the only way it is censored not to see their faces/bodies is by the tv channel editors or like the ABC FOR Australian story about David Shaw's life. They definately had the full version where the camera keep focus on both bodies where their faces and bodies were exposed to everyone including the camera.
And I can tell the ABC censored the time of when you would be viewing their bodies particularly faces, as the ABC chose differently from other versions shown of the footage of their bodies on land... As the ABC chose two quickly minimise the screen size of the original footage and a jump cut like the other channels censoring of the moment their bodies are visible to everyone. And then the camera definately captured that, otherwise there would be no need for AbC or original south African channel and repeat channels having to cut quickly just as you are about to see their faces and exposed dead bodies, cut to vision of Soldiers carrying the two bodies now in White body bags to the transport.

So the ABC Australia would have received the FULL un edited version that included the Moment Deon's and David's faces and bodies become fully visible after being dragged into the land beach area... And also I'm pretty sure the camera just continued filming, including the soldiers or who ever placing both bodies into White body bags for transport.
And capturing this whole period from where their faces and overall bodies become visible to everyone that was there, all the way to when the camera also captures the old rusted Tanks that were attached to Deon, removed and put into the back of a vehicle.
So that whole time was captured, where they were dragged out and visible to everyone, to their bodies being lifted and put in White body bags, then showing soldiers carrying the bodies in body bags through the fields and to the transport area where all the vehicles were. And when they opened body bags and removed Deon's Tanks and equipment and closed bags again... And then both bodies in bags were placed in vehicle to transport to Coroner. 
As its definitely captured of the removal of Deon's equipment at least the edited cut from their faces almost being shown on the edited footage to the point where you see Deon's rusted somewhat primitive Equipment tanks etc compared to what David had... As described by the narrator...
So there is cottage that was cut for a Tv friendly version of the documentary from the bodies being exposed to surface and just about to see both deceased divers Faces on the beach area. All the way until showing the rusted Tanks of Deon Dreyer.

So that whole period that was cut by both the RSA channel that aired it originally, to the ABC Australia that had the full unedited version which would show footage of both Deon's and David's faces and their bodies overall after being dragged out, and footage also of bodies going into the bags and out on Guerneys, and then also what would be on the ABC unedited copy their received would be where at the vehicles at some point they removed Deon's Tanks. A da from then on they show the rest of the footage.

So abc cut out the moment where their faces were about to be shown by quickly shrinking screen so not to be able to see dead divers Faces especially Deon's who was down there for a decade and I assume would have had extreme decomposition, to the next part thatthey could show of the tanks by themselves.
Understandable as even late night would not. So appropite or broadcasting the remains, one of while was severely decomposed to the world mainly Australia and South Africa but on YouTube, as I do feel for their families as even though I really want to see the unedited uncensored footage of the bodies for my own Medical interest Into the state of decomposition Deon sustained versus bodies recovered from rivers tapped in their vehicles for the same amount of time of ten years, and simply compared both to normal deonpotision as its one of the only extreme depth ten year body recoveries where cameras captured the Initial exposure of the corpse to the surface after so long, and what the body would look like.
And I cannot stress enough how much I wasn't to explain that I only am interested in seeing the FULL uncut uncensored unedited Original footage captured of the resurfacing and exposure and visibility of both bodies, and the placement into body bags and then removal of at least Deon's Tanks from what I could tell as I didn't see footage at all that they removed Davids equipment as well.

I do not mean to offend any family members or loved ones.
As both of these brave men as well as the super brave act of Don Shirley by going down to the dangerous depth of where David and Deon were, and checking on his Mate only to be shocked at the poor souls demise.. while having to write a SLATE that he was not coming back, which was truly exceptional of him to think of writing David was dead but in a sencere way as not to shock everyone if they read DAVID is DEAD. All the whole doing that seeing Dave who he shook hands with an hour or so earlier as his best mate, being shocked at the fact he won't be coming back up Alive, then writing the slate...
Trying to come up to surface as slowly as possible, a da throwing up into his own re breather from the decompression vs hycapnia trying to get up there without getting the Benz and cincentratnb on simply keeping conscious and not allowing the vomit to re.enter his rebreather, using all his muscles and energy and metal stamina to swim up the 200 master deep cave... Surly thinking he too will susumb to this cursed hole...
And thankfully magainb to get up to surface trying to breathe through vomit, mental shock at his best friends death and all the while he was thinking about his best mate, Daves safety and going down to check and possibly try save him....
To suddenly having to mourn and keep breathing while vomitting abiding the Benz and trying to get the slate up to the crew explaining Dave's demise and his own peril in returning to surface vomitting....
What a champ


But can anyone tell me anyway if they know where I could watch the full unedited uncensored Film footage of the Bodies coming up to the surface, with their faces and overall bodies visible, to the soldiers placement in body bags and removal of equipment before bodies were transported away.
?

I'm sure someone will or knows where a copy showing full bodies and everything till the showing of the rusty air tanks of Deon....

My medical interest, and general curiousity is my rwsodning and which I hope someone can help me find it just to watch the removed unedited parts, which is really the Body visinllth parts of the original captured footage.

Or photos or screenshots of unedited parts showing bodies when they are on surface and body bags and removal of Deon's Tanks.

Anyone seen the bodies in the video or pictures of screenshots of the bodies fully shown even if there are somewhere autopsy or pics of the bodies from coroner examination of both bodies but more so Deon Dreyer as it is unique part of viewing a decade old Corpse remains of a tragic death and how deon Dreyers remains deckposed over the whole 5en years as in comparison to a corpse recovered in Shallower but high current waters, like when a person drives into a river with a fast or slow current and their bodies are trapped in vehicle unable to escape... And other bodies that were recovered from Water after more than fiver years to compare TO Deon's remains? ☺️😔 Any websites that show bodies and medical research into divers remains and other such pictures or footage? 
Please let me.know 
Thank you all...😄",2022-06-27 16:34:14
km6c2w,I think he was just saying caught a photo (shot) of his goggles. Yeah its sad the 20 yr old boy had been missing for 10 years.. Dave and I believe Don found him and left the scene and contacted Deons family. Promising the return of their boy.. He did keep his promise unfortunately at the cost of his own life but he knew and took that risk to reunite the family. God bless their souls 😢,2023-06-23 04:21:31
km6c2w,"Well... The dude just went from stupid to straight up asshole territory. And all that to drag up a *corpse*. Not to save a buddy or someone who was visibly and freshly in trouble.

km6c2w,"Hahaha. Good! That was 100% my intention. 😉

Just make sure you go with a place that actually makes you do theory and pool practice before going open-water. 

I’ve been lots of places where they’ll take uncertified people on open water (ocean) dives deeper than 10-20ft because while it’s unsafe, they get those dollars for it. Hell, I dove the Blue Hole and I’m pretty sure half the people in my group were legit beginners. That they took to 130ft. I have an advanced cert and shouldn’t have been allowed to go that deep!

The more anal a place is about the rules, the more relaxed I am diving with them (my fave was in Malaysia where I was a one month past the “if you go more than 1-year between dives, you need to take a refresher course” rule and they absolutely would not bend it for me. I knew I was in good hands)",2020-12-29 17:40:45

500hy3,"So each case of NF can vary greatly, but one thing that is usually common is the benign tumors that grow along nerves and cafe au lait spots. The cafe au lait marks are  caramel/light brown ""birth marks"" that appear on the skin.  The tumors are sometimes hard to remove due to their location and size.  A lot of times these tumors will grow in a cluster (think of a bunch of grapes on the vine) so removing them is hard since they could grow back bigger if all of it wasn't removed.  Another common characteristic are fibromas (tumors), or little bumps,  that grow on the skin.  From my experience, both personal and what i read online, most doctors won't remove them if they arent causing pain or limiting you phyiscally.  This is one of the aspects that makes it challenging to live with.

My case is fairly mild.  No where near that of Joseph's.  Unfortunately, there really is no, getting well with this.  More of just hoping (praying if thats your thing) that your case remains consistant.  I appreciate the concern though!  😀  Mine has been for the most part consistent since i finished chemo at age 5 (30 now).  I have noticed  a few tumors grow since then.  One in my throat, one in/around my right bicep, and others on the left side of my abs that feels like they're close to the kidneys.  The kidney ones hurt the most. This is often described as pins and needles type a pain.  Imagine if someone was clenching their hands and had thumb tacks between each finger then lightly jabbed you.  Not strong enough to cause serious injury,  but enough to make you say ""fuck, that hurt"".  When you see a dr about them, they usually just keep a watch on it rather than remove them, unless they're in a very critical place.  The tumor that was growing on my right optic nerve was caught and treated before i went completely blind.  The tumor by my spinal cord was near where the bottom of the skull meets the spinal cord. It was literally only a few millimeters away from making me paralyzed from the neck down.  

With all that being said i do live a fairly normal active life.  I climbed st helens recently, i regularly go on 50 bike rides, im at the mountain in winter most of the time.  So it's not always a disorder that  severely hinders your daily activities.

One should watch Gareth Evans’s “the Apostle” on Netflix if one hasn’t already. That flick does a not-terrible job of exploring the darker side of a Gaia-type nature deity... Yes, they can bring worshippers bounty on an earthly scale; but they are also OF the earth and therefore capable of pettiness and cruelty, and they’re driven primarily by a survival instinct. You know, like US. I think that’s why the lore is so fascinating/appealing — the gods are more ‘human’ — more “realistic.”

65p5mz,">When are you deviantart metalheads gonna learn, if the Prince of Darkness were walking the earth, he would be in the form of an incredibly attractive male or female, with some small but utterlty hideous deformation.

Why do you say this like it's some universal truth? Like it's this verifiable fact? Has the Prince of Darkness himself, beautiful and yet somehow deformed, visited you in your domicile? 

I think the reason people are downvoting you so thoroughly is because you're presenting your opinion as an immutable aspect of reality. And you can say 'Oh, I don't care 😋' or 'let the haters hate lel 😂😂' all you want, but the fact of the matter is, you want your ideas to be heard just as much as the next redditor, otherwise you wouldn't have written out what can only be described as a diatribe. 

One human to another, you might think about relaxing next time. I hope this isn't mean, because I don't want to make you or anyone feel bad. But I know you, like most everyone who posts on here, want to be heard and appreciated, and you will never be if you act like such an insufferable I'm-right-you're-wrong snotnose. 

You and me know the same about the truth of the devil, which is to say we don't know shit. So don't act like you know what (s)he would do or look like. 

edit: I'm legit sitting here, no doubt baited, arguing about the fucking devil, of all things. Next thing you know I'll be engaged in a fierce debate concerning leprechauns and what kind of underwear they prefer wearing. Or maybe about the species of grass unicorns prefer to graze upon.

65p5mz,"      😂 Him and Hemingway are the two ""great American authors"" that just really don't sit well with me. 

Now give me some Goethe (hey everyone, you wanna see an A-grade representation of Lucifer, read 'Faust'), some Ibsen, Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann, Chekhov, Dostoevsky, John Kennedy Toole, to name a few. Now those gents can write.

     For those interested in learning about the actual meaning and origins of the word/symbol of baphomet (note: it is NOT just another synonym for what the bourgeoisie call the devil, satan, Lucifer etc)

      Check out this article:

Lastly, to the OP: Your drawing shows you have talent, thanks for sharing. I simply ask that you consider renaming him(or her or it) something more appropriate. How about ""Horn-ed Beast"" or ""Scary Monster""? 😘",2017-04-16 22:37:02

ii950g,"I mean I am doctor and this was certainly beautiful fiction (especially the art, truly beautiful and conveys the eerie atmosphere perfectly).

However we should remember this is fiction since I read some of the comments. You are right not to trust your doctor unconditionally cause they are only human and humans can let you down.

What you can trust unconditionally is that we took an oath to serve and protect human life, not to cause further harm through our actions. If your doctor says he/she will do everything in their power to treat you and improve your condition, you can trust the integrity of the intent unconditionally. That much I can say! (exceptions to the rule apply of course, as with anything in life)

But that's just my 2 cents. Loved the art and presentation. Keep em coming and keep safe 😊",2020-08-29 14:29:32
