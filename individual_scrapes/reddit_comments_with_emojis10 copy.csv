aq5xw7,"Not Op but here's the recipe they posted on r/food

Messed up the title 🤦‍♀️ it's a BLUEBERRY lemon cheesecake! Recipe used is from u/frozenbirdie in another thread.

Bottom Layer

    100 g butter
    135 g Digestive biscuits
    50 g Almonds

Instructions: Melt the butter in a saucepan. Crush the biscuits and almonds in a food processor. Stir biscuits and almonds with the melted butter. Pour the biscuit mix into the spring shape and squeeze it in a even layer to the edge so that the entire bottom is covered. Place the bottom of the fridge and prepare the cream.

First cheesecake layer

    3x gelatin leaf
    400 g cream cheese
    1 tsp Vanilla Paste
    1 tsp grated lemon peel
    1 tsp Lemon extract
    150 g greek yogurt
    70 g Sugar

Instructions: Place the gelatin in cold water for 10 minutes. Melt the gelatin in a water bath. [Note: this was my first time using gelatin leaves and I had no idea what this meant! I used a double boiler; a pan with about an inch of water in it, simmering, and another bowl rested on top where I put the gelatin leaves. They melted within about a minute.] 

In another bowl, cream cheese, vanilla, lemon extract, grated lemon peel, Greek yogurt and sugar are stirred into a smooth cream. Mix the cheese into the warm, melted gelatin, and turn it together gently. Pour the mixed cream cheese into the spring form on top of the biscuit bottom. Put the cake on the fridge while making the blueberry layer.

Blueberry cheesecake layer

    5x Gelatin leaf
    150 g Frozen blueberries
    100 g sugar
    300 g cream cheese
    1 tsp. Lemon extract
    150 g Greek yogurt

Instructions: Place the gelatin in cold water for 10 minutes. Pour blueberries and 50 g of sugar into a small saucepan. Boil quietly on low heat while stirring. When the sugar is dissolved, blueberry blends into a smooth purée. Turn the gelatin out of water and melt it in the hot blueberry purée. In a bowl, cream cheese, lemon extract, Greek yogurt and the rest of the sugar are stirred into a smooth cream. Gently turn the lukewarm blueberry puree into the curd. Pour the blueberry cream in the spring shape on top of the curd with vanilla. Put the cake in the fridge for 2 hours until the mass has settled. It is quite normal that the blueberry layer is ""thin"" compared to the vanilla layer, but don't worry, give it time and it will settle.

Purple jelly

    5x gelatin leaf
    300ml water
    150 g sugar
    2 tsp. Vanilla Extract
    ½ tsp. Purple food color [or a drop red + a drop blue]

Instructions: Place the gelatin in cold water. Add half of the water in a saucepan, add sugar and vanilla extract and cook to a sugar syrup while stirring. Turn off the heat and add the gelatin, color and the remaining water, stir and let the jelly cool until it's lukewarm. Gently pour the liquid jelly on the cheesecake [I poured over a strainer to ensure a smooth surface]. Put the cake in the fridge for approx. 30 minutes or until the jelly has settled completely. I had the cake in the fridge for about 2-3 hours until it set enough for me to confidently remove the spring form.",2019-02-13 13:53:56

7ru59q,"I did a week long study abroad trip to Lyon last year! We took classes at the Bocuse Institute and ate at two of his restaurants. L'Auberge du Pont de Collonges (where he died) was one of the most surreal restaurant experiences I’ve ever had. We even got a tour of the kitchen. The decor, the kitchen tour, the service, and the food was all one of a kind. It was such an incredible high-end institution, yet we all felt so welcome there. 

When it comes to one man and one city, I cannot imagine a more influential person. Restaurants, institutes, streets, murals — everything in Lyon — is named after Paul Bocuse.

Cut charge could be $5?  Probably will want to file the edges to clean up a flame cut edge.  1/4 inch could be shear cut and pretty clean.
YMMV.  

 Maybe tell the cost quoter you want it to make pizza - might get the max, best customer discount or nailed with a foodie hipster increase.  ",2018-07-25 02:50:13

pco4y9,">drastically awful grammatical error

It's really not that egregious and could be boiled down to a simple typo.

>grammar of their own

Single person, so his/her at the very least.

>“An art”, you’ve

We're taught that the comma goes inside the quotes, though this seems to be increasingly *out of fashion*.

>and , as

There shouldn't be a space in front of the comma. This is a drastically awful punctuation error.

>act like they were

Single person, so he/she at the very least.

>Never will you ever see something like this in a gallery

**art**
*noun* the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.

Crazy how ""gallery"" isn't mentioned in the definition of ""art""!

Sona masoori is a bit milder. I like to have 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water for average firmness. If you want it a bit more tough for biryani or fried rice, 1 cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water is best. Don't do 1:1, it will be WAY too difficult to swallow. ❤️",2020-07-07 19:56:41

Amsterdam is pretty well known for their 'legal' marijuana tourism, and the place to purchase said goods are called ""coffeeshops.""

A normal place to grab an espresso and a pastry might be called a ""cafe"" rather than coffeeshop, as to not confuse any ""cana-tourists"" seeking their specific destination.

j0d0y9,"Wooden knives, trays, etc. would be more ideal when handling honeycomb 🍯 the honey reacts to the metal utensils and affects the overall flavor.

j0d0y9,They usually come in a nice little plastic carton. All you need is a butter knife. 😁,2020-09-27 12:26:52
j0d0y9,Colony collapse doesn’t usually have anything to do with honey harvesting. Moreover the issue stems from infestation and disease from varroa mites which can destroy entire colonies if not taken care of(also the use of certain pesticides). The honey I collect is from excess that is stored by the bees during the height of the nectar flow. I always make sure that the bees have enough honey to overwinter. 😁,2020-09-26 22:26:57
j0d0y9,Quite impressive for a hive. We usually get 50-60 on average per hive but one summer we got 80 kg/hive. We got so much honey we didn't know what to do with it! 😂,2020-09-27 00:59:00

mg60xk,"Be still, my heart 😍😛

I grew up in upstate NY and one of the things I miss most about living there was the fact that in New York, you can walk into literally any deli and order a bacon, egg and cheese, and it will come like this, on a Kaiser roll.  They will probably ask if you want SPK (yes please).

Honestly out here a lot of people don’t even know what a Kaiser roll is.  You can get an egg sandwich on a biscuit or bagel or English muffin, but it’s just not the same.  Out here the breakfast burrito is king.

That pic literally made my mouth water 🤤",2021-03-30 11:13:08

Otherwise they’re kawaii style in esthetic 😁",2020-06-29 07:07:37
hhl5sz,"They taste good but depend on where you buy them cuz some places make them too sweet.  Also it’s one of the harder pastry to perfect, since macarons are known to be finicky to make.  So I guess it appeals to bakers wanting a challenge 🤣.",2020-06-28 21:08:22

hhl5sz,Italian method is more stable than French and batter lasts longer too.  I just don’t know any other method except French.  I mean I’ve tried them but unsuccessful and too many steps so I don’t want to practice.  French is less steps so practicing with it is easier 😂.,2020-06-29 15:23:45

hhl5sz,Ribbon test is where you take use your spatula and scoop up some batter and try to draw an 8 with it.  If the batter break then the batter is too thick.  But if your batter fall down too fast then it’s too runny.  Think you can YouTube and see what I mean.  I’m not very good at explaining 😜.,2020-06-29 08:31:20

6nnh1a,So... tuna live in the ocean where it's too cold for the bacteria that lives in warm water to survive. And they have a really high core temperature which kills the bacteria that lives in cold water. So that means you can eat it raw and there's no bacteria to make you sick. 🤗,2017-07-16 18:32:58

I brought home a box of baklava from Dubai airport once. I had no idea what baklava even was, I just picked it up as a last minute giftshop buy of sorts... When I finally got home and had a bite of it, I was floored. This particular baklava filling was sooooo fine you couldn't taste or feel the nuts, which for me was what made it 10/10 since I don't like nuts ",2018-08-20 19:57:07

6 tbsp cornstarch

6 tbsp all purpose flour

16 tbsp refrigerated water

➡ Whisk all together until homogeneous

➡ Dip the cubed chicken in and fry 2 x 5 min (first time until lightly golden, rest 5 minutes and then second fry until well golden) at 180 degrees Celsius",2021-05-29 18:21:43

I used mini macarons in the same flavors (strawberry, vanilla and lavender) that I made for her too—to tie everything together 😃

I do make my cookie in many flavors (making pumpkin spice ones this fall and will be topped with ground cherries and marigolds) but this is what my client wanted for her bday. It was delish (I made mini ones for my kids and friends with the leftovers)",2020-08-19 15:00:13

Have some responsibility over your life. If someone sells you “magic beans,” that’s your fault. Not their fault for selling you something that doesn’t exist. 

Furthermore, those are artificial colors and flavoring. Do you know pretty much the only source of that hot pink color is crushed up beetles?  Not exactly vegan.",2019-10-13 10:38:20

I'm a closed food truck during covid. So this was a chance to take photos to use when we reopen soon. Made in my yard.

I've not been great at big Texas style platters and needed to focus on preso.

Brisket. Beef ribs. Pork ribs. Pulled Pork. Chili Cheese beef snags. Mac n cheese. Traditional potato salad, and fancy candy pecan mustard potato salad. Plus all the trim.

Smoked it all in a 1000 gallon Texas style offset in Perth, Australia. Just Salt and pepper mostly for the rub.

h0xwcw,"My eyes/stomach always draws towards the sausage in BBQ pictures like this.

For some reason I just don’t care too much for/about BBQ.

I’d rather have the meat be more plainly seasoned.

But I do like BBQ sausage, as long as it’s not spicy in any ways.

I have very mild white person tastes 😀

Edit: I think the main thing is the sauce. I don’t really care for meat that has a lot of sauce, and BBQ sauce is usually a little too tangy for my liking. I just don’t think meat necessarily needs to be wet. But I also hate dry BBQ as well lol",2020-06-11 23:13:14

ibnwhu,I absolutely loved the way it looked and wanted to try for myself but once I clicked the link I was heartbroken 💔💔💔 the owner of the website had denied access to people on my country. It sad to have to face discrimination solely on the basis of nationality. This is just one of the very many restrictions I’ve had just because of of my nationality. People don’t get to choose where they want to to born. Why do innocent people constantly suffer based on the crimes of a few. I feel this is unfair and it gets to me really had. At times I question if it’s really worth it to live life like this 💔😔,2020-08-18 08:36:41

So, next time you do this, you could add the *slightest* amount of coloring to the ‘white’ areas, and it would help the yellow files stand out more. Another benefit is getting to have more of said cake, as it may have a moldy appearance utilizing this method. 🤷🏻‍♂️",2018-02-02 09:14:00

o6ahxt,"My childhood dog once pushed a rolling chair from the computer room into the adjacent kitchen/dining room and used the chair to launch him onto the countertop. But when he did that, he pushed the chair away and got stuck on the counter. He managed to pull open a kitchen cupboard and ate an entire loaf of bread and some other things while the house was empty. I found him several hours later when I came home from school, laying on the counter, his belly distended and the bread sleeve shredded, looking absolutely pitiful. He was totally fine btw.

o6ahxt,"My old roommates cat and dog were demons about food. I cooked chicken once and left it piping hot fresh out of the oven on my plate once for not even a whole minute to check the laundry before I ate. I heard a gently but wet splat noise and I turned around to see my chicken was gone off the plate, the cat was on the counter licking his paw and the dog was sitting on the floor like nothing happened. All you could see was a greasy spot on the time where the chicken had hit the floor before getting inhaled 

They also knocked over a pizza box once while I was at work and I came home to find it upside down on the floor, the remaining pizza gone and all that was left was one dried out crust that I didn’t finish 🥲",2021-06-24 00:43:43

b00rer,"A staple in my household.  Except for the spicy side; I often want something much stronger than theirs. 😁

Oh, we’ve also had good luck with a portable induction stovetop rather than the propane.  The pluses are it’s not nearly as tall, and you don’t have to interrupt the meal to change out propane bottles. Also no actual fire at the table.  Minuses are making sure not to trip over the cord, and the fact that it has a fan going constantly (though that sound has just become part of the experience for us now).",2019-03-12 13:43:35
b00rer,"Yeah I also use induction, but I figure for people just start out, the cheaper investment is easier to get into. One plus point of propane is you can now do hotpot at the beach (don't know if legal or not, but we haven't gotten a ticket yet🤣)",2019-03-12 17:06:30

▪600g of fresh brewed espresso or dark roasted coffee

▪10g vanilla extract

▪450g heavy whipping cream

▪6 egg yolks

▪150g white sugar

▪8g salt

▪40g marsala wine

▪48 store bought lady fingers

▪100g+40g dutch process cocoa powder for topping and soak

Combine the espresso/coffee with the vanilla extract and 40g of cocoa powder. Whisk to combine until fully dissolved.Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, mix the heavy cream until stiff peaks are formed. DO NOT OVER WHIP..Using a double boiler method, add egg yolks, sugar, salt, and marsala. Place over pot of simmering water, whisking constantly. Do not stop mixing as eggs will scramble. Moderate the heat while whisking for 5-10 minutes until thickened.Mix egg mixture into bowl with mascarpone until smooth. Gently fold in half of whipped cream. When incorporated, fold in other half, GENTLY.Build Tiramisu in a 9x13 baking dish. You should be able to fit 24 lady fingers in each layer. Dip each lady finger in the coffee mixture for 2-3 seconds. Layer in ½ of the cream mixture, evenly. Repeat, layering 24 dipped ladyfingers followed by a second layer of the cream mix.Sift cocoa powder on top of the tiramisu and refrigerate for 8-24 hours.Cut first slice from center of tiramisu, not the corner.",2022-12-06 00:53:04

c6h7r7,Thanks a lot!!!! Now I have to get up and grill me some burgers!!!!  😂,2019-06-28 19:14:46
c6h7r7,"Wow this blew up 🤯. To everyone asking for a recipe - I just tried to copy a picture of what a Big Mac looked like and how I knew it was structured from eating so many of them but here’s a couple of pointers:

- I used ~75g beef per patty (this is more than McDonalds use). Form them thin and slightly larger than the bun as they will contract during cooking. If you have time form them ahead of cooking and put them back in the fridge for a bit. This will help them hold their structure better. I didn’t add anything to the beef. Just seasoned with a little salt & pepper during cooking.

- Cook the patties for ~3-4 mins per side (or use your own judgement here but you want to aim for some nice caramelisation. Look up the Maillard Reaction). Only flip once. 

- Use basic processed cheese slices. Do not try to get fancy here. Add cheese immediately after flipping the patty.

- Lightly toast top and bottom bun on the inside only. Lightly toast club (middle) bun on both sides. Cut bottom crust off middle bun before toasting.

- Cut your onion into small cubes. If you’ve had a Big Mac before you’ll know what to aim for here.

- Use fresh crunchy iceberg lettuce cut into narrow strips.

- I used store bought sauce which is identical to the real thing. It’s called McEnnedys Burger Sauce. If you’re in the UK/Ireland you can get it in Lidl.

- Use a picture of an actual Big Mac to guide you when putting everything together.

Good luck & enjoy!",2019-06-29 07:54:56
c6h7r7,To call this a big mac you have to squash it down so it's quite flat then sprinkle the lettuce outside of the bun then have your one thin slice of pickle hanging half off 😉. Looks like the kind of burger they should be selling.,2019-06-28 11:06:31

Plus, occasionally I’ll grab a cheesy bean and rice burrito or a mcd’s cheeseburger for a buck if my total is less than the DoorDash estimate, then I’ll just slide a buck into one of the customers bags. Works out great, saves me time and feeds me, and I don’t have to do two orders or swipe my card. 

Haven’t had a single customer mention the dollar yet lol so idk if anyone realizes what I’m doing or not. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Not like I do it all the time though, mostly just the real busy days where I don’t have time to stop.  Or more that I just don’t want to stop making money, a 20-minute pause to eat could end up costing me anywhere from $6 to possibly $30-$40 on a big batch order.

I feel like most people would be cool about it but I could definitely be assuming wrong idk. It’s just a buck. I guess I may just find out at some point.",2019-06-28 17:42:41

However when I have cooked them I like to use garlic butter and just fry them in a pan until they get nice and brown like in the picture. Maybe some onion powder to, but I'm no culinary chef and it is very rare for me to take some home for myself to cook.",2018-08-27 11:07:13

If someone in France thinly sliced a ton of processed meat and white bread, then assembled it this beautifully... I would applaud them and be slightly jealous, knowing I will never enjoy a hot dog casserole as nice as theirs.

ikvezu,That looks delicious. I just don't have the patience to make that dish ☹️,2020-09-02 02:52:58
ikvezu,"Nice to see so many people enjoy Indian food. If you're willing to take a crack at cooking some yourself, I'm sure you can find a basic recipe online. I'll drop a tip that my mom taught me before I left for college: When you're cooking the masala (aka spices), cook it till it lets go of the oil. I.e. if you stop stirring, you'll see the oil release from the curry. That's how you know it's cooked and ready. A general rule for me is to simmer the curry for at least 30 mins.

Oh, and another pro tip, curry always tastes better the next day. Make sure you save some leftovers 😉",2020-09-02 03:59:15

Recipe formatted for easier viewing

Bottom Layer

• 100 g butter

• 135 g Digestive biscuits

• 50 g Almonds

Instructions:

1.	⁠Melt the butter in a saucepan.
2.	⁠Crush the biscuits and almonds in a food processor. Stir biscuits and almonds with the melted butter.
3.	⁠Pour the biscuit mix into the spring shape and squeeze it in a even layer to the edge so that the entire bottom is covered.
4.	⁠Place the bottom of the fridge and prepare the cream.

First cheesecake layer

• 3x gelatin leaf

• 400 g cream cheese

• 1 tsp Vanilla Paste

• 1 tsp grated lemon peel

• 1 tsp Lemon extract

• 150 g greek yogurt

• 70 g Sugar

Instructions:

1.	⁠Place the gelatin in cold water for 10 minutes. Melt the gelatin in a water bath. [Note: this was my first time using gelatin leaves and I had no idea what this meant! I used a double boiler; a pan with about an inch of water in it, simmering, and another bowl rested on top where I put the gelatin leaves. They melted within about a minute.]
2.	⁠In another bowl, cream cheese, vanilla, lemon extract, grated lemon peel, Greek yogurt and sugar are stirred into a smooth cream.
3.	⁠Mix the cheese into the warm, melted gelatin, and turn it together gently.
4.	⁠Pour the mixed cream cheese into the spring form on top of the biscuit bottom.
5.	⁠Put the cake on the fridge while making the blueberry layer.

Blueberry cheesecake layer

• 5x Gelatin leaf

• 150 g Frozen blueberries

• 100 g sugar

• 300 g cream cheese

• 1 tsp. Lemon extract

• 150 g Greek yogurt

Instructions:

1.	⁠Place the gelatin in cold water for 10 minutes.
2.	⁠Pour blueberries and 50 g of sugar into a small saucepan. Boil quietly on low heat while stirring. When the sugar is dissolved, blueberry blends into a smooth purée.
3.	⁠Turn the gelatin out of water and melt it in the hot blueberry purée.
4.	⁠In a bowl, cream cheese, lemon extract, Greek yogurt and the rest of the sugar are stirred into a smooth cream.
5.	⁠Gently turn the lukewarm blueberry puree into the curd.
6.	⁠Pour the blueberry cream in the spring shape on top of the curd with vanilla.
7.	⁠Put the cake in the fridge for 2 hours until the mass has settled. It is quite normal that the blueberry layer is ""thin"" compared to the vanilla layer, but don't worry, give it time and it will settle.

Purple jelly

• 5x gelatin leaf

• 300ml water

• 150 g sugar

• 2 tsp. Vanilla Extract

• ½ tsp. Purple food color [or a drop red + a drop blue]

Instructions:

1.	⁠Place the gelatin in cold water.
2.	⁠Add half of the water in a saucepan, add sugar and vanilla extract and cook to a sugar syrup while stirring. Turn off the heat and add the gelatin, color and the remaining water, stir and let the jelly cool until it's lukewarm.
3.	⁠Gently pour the liquid jelly on the cheesecake [I poured over a strainer to ensure a smooth surface].
4.	⁠Put the cake in the fridge for approx. 30 minutes or until the jelly has settled completely. I had the cake in the fridge for about 2-3 hours until it set enough for me to confidently remove the spring form.",2021-04-04 07:34:28

92gn03,"Also, please buy real garlic, not that pre-grated stuff. Chop coarsely, and fry it on medium heat in your pool, before adding vegetables. It should never get darker than light brown.
Take the garlic out of the oil and throw it away. All the oil will have wonderful garlic taste, which will infuse the rest of the vegetables with flavour.


Another tip, since I see your toasted bread: when the bread is toasted and still warm, take one clove of garlic and rub it's tip on the bread. The bread will act like sanding paper, so you don't have to press really hard, unless you want a lot 😀. No need to skin the clove, it'll be ripped up by the bread.
Now you have bread with a faint garlic taste. Get a really good cold pressed virgin olive oil, and drizzle that shit onto your bread, generously. (alternatively some butter)
Note you have the easiest garlic bread possible. My kids love it, and they're afraid of garlic.",2018-07-28 07:33:22

Not sure if you can tell in the picture but the shortbread did crumble a fair bit when I cut it. I probably wouldn’t advise using a separated tin, all my edge ones looked a bit rubbish. The caramel had dripped down the side of the shortbread so you can’t really see the layers on that side properly. I admit I hid all those at the back of the pile! 😂",2019-01-28 22:45:17
akgnfu,"My great aunt made the best caramel slice that was a tradition to have at any country funeral,wedding or reunion we attended with nestle chocolate and malt biscuits base . I’ve tried and failed many times getting it to the way she made it.  Reminds me to try again. 😋 ",2019-01-28 02:25:39

qoqdez,"Do you have some more videos about piping them? Or would you share your recipe? I started making macarons some years ago, but only the usual round ones. And I think the receipt I use is too runny to pipe it into figures like yours. I thought about making some macaron Christmas Trees or snowmen. Would appreciate some tip! 😊",2021-11-07 23:31:52

qoqdez,"Hehe quite the opposite. Your hands are constantly moving to pipe different shapes.  I don’t have steady hands that’s why I hardly do round macarons, cuz I can’t make them even and round 😅😬",2021-11-07 22:49:28

qoqdez,😆 lol.  But honestly I’m just an amateur .  I don’t even bake anything else other than macarons cuz I suck at everything I tried to do.  I’m only decent at piping macarons cuz I spend too much time on them ☺️.,2021-11-07 23:11:40
qoqdez,"Aww thank you so much for the sweet and kind comment about my work!   Usually a batch like this would take a few hours from start to finish.  2.5 hrs just to pipe them.  That’s why it’s just a hobby and I do it whenever I have time. 

Heheh I still have days that I have to throw them out because I didn’t like my batter consistency cuz I either didn’t whipped my meringue stiff enough or I over macaronage 😅",2021-11-08 00:01:49

is8z6p,What a waste of brisket 🥺,2020-09-14 04:08:01
is8z6p,"It’s pretty simple! 

I cut up the brisket in big chunks, season with salt and pepper and brown them in a big pan. I used a cast iron pot. 
Remove the meat and add chopped carrots, celery and onion to pot until softened. Then add some tomato paste and flour to thicken and cook couple more minutes. 
Add whole bottle Cabernet Sauvignon and add meat back to pot. Let it cook until wine reduces by half. 
Then add whole box of beef stock. 
Add parsley, bay leaves, oregano, rosemary and whole head of garlic. 
Cover and cook for 2.5-3 hours either in oven at 350 or can do it on the stovetop which is what I did on medium /medium low heat until the meat is tender. 
Strain the liquid and serve on top! 

Potatoes are super easy. Boil peeled potatoes in salted water for half hour or until fork tender. Drain and use electric mixer to mash. Add butter, garlic, and heavy cream until they’re the taste and consistency you like.

b1du8r,"I’ve made this style o’ pancake a few times and they’re bombay, son. More labor intensive than regular ones.

jya3zs,Tomato on a burger tho 🤢,2020-11-21 13:38:15
jya3zs,Because a REAL Whopper would never look that good! 👌🏽,2020-11-21 16:17:43
jya3zs,"this looks absolutely amazing, but the ex-burger king employee in me immediately noticed that the pickles are in the wrong spot lol. It really doesn’t matter at all, but im getting flashbacks of my manager going off on me. The correct order (from bottom to top) is meat, cheese, bacon, pickle, ketchup, onion, tomato, lettuce, mayo. And DONT put the ketchup on top of your onions and your pickles, its has to be inbetween, for some stupid unknown reason 😂 (jokes aside, this looks yummy. Well done!)",2020-11-21 19:11:20
jya3zs,Looks freaking delicious 😋,2020-11-21 19:45:07
jya3zs,😋😋,2020-11-21 19:59:39

jya3zs,That's absolutely beautiful 😊 thank you,2020-11-21 20:49:49
jya3zs,I hate onions but I’d eat the hell out of this burger omfg it looks so beautiful 😭,2020-11-21 20:57:35
jya3zs,Very nice 👍,2020-11-21 21:57:20
jya3zs,"👍Kudos man, Kudos",2020-11-22 00:59:30
jya3zs,That looks so freakin good! I’m going to go make a burger 🍔 but it’s not going to be a whopper. Haha probably a “flopper”,2020-11-22 01:39:39
jya3zs,Damn this looks good. I’m hungry 😋,2020-11-22 03:04:26
jya3zs,I just ate but all these food pics have me feeling some type of way 😍,2020-12-09 05:03:24
jya3zs,"Ha I know I mentioned that this is my variation when I posted it on my IG, but they flip out here if you post much more other than a title lol. I didn't realise people would get so amped up about pickle placement! 😂",2020-11-21 18:47:42
jya3zs,Thanks I think it might even be a Double Whopper with bacon and cheese!  Cheese doesn't come standard where we are 👍,2020-11-21 14:16:29
jya3zs,😂Thanks!,2020-11-21 14:27:51
jya3zs,"Grind together 1lb of untrimmed short rib and 1lb of untrimmed chuck. Add 4tbsp worcestershire sauce, 2tbsp fish sauce, 1tsp of liquid smoke and one teaspoon of onion powder. Shape into 5oz patties and keep cold. Cook for two minutes each side. Make buns (you probably don't have to do this step lol) add bacon, American cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup and mayo 👍",2020-11-21 12:54:22
jya3zs,Nah I typically eat most burgers upside down for this exact reason 👍,2020-11-21 17:04:47
jya3zs,"Judging by some of the comments, some people are still struggling ☺️",2020-11-21 17:23:15
jya3zs,😂😂 better believe it!!!,2020-11-21 17:32:31
jya3zs,"First I make them about an inch or so bigger than I'll need them. They'll swell a bit no matter what, especially on the grill so I find if you have an extra bit to start with you don't notice losing it. I also keep the patties stacked cold on squares of parchment paper so I can just flip the meat straight onto the grill and hold it for a few seconds before I take the paper off. I'm sure there's a more scientific method, divots in the middle etc, but this always works for me 🤷‍♂️",2020-11-21 18:24:21
jya3zs,I hate them too but I have an awesome hint for you: you can easily remove them 👍,2020-11-21 14:46:53
jya3zs,😂😂 that's so funny I actually took it out after the photo. But it just doesn't look like a Whopper without it!,2020-11-21 13:44:57
jya3zs,No....WE did it. 💪,2020-11-21 23:47:37
jya3zs,😂 search my name in r/pizza,2020-11-22 00:02:13
jya3zs,I fully understand that and would probably have done the same... 🤭,2020-11-21 14:48:24
jya3zs,Thanks yeah I noticed that also! It's a really easily identifiable characteristic 👍,2020-11-21 12:58:41
jya3zs,I already typed it out in one of the other comments! 👍,2020-11-21 14:52:05

7yge5f,"Yess this is it! I tried to detail it as much as possible! Its sounds like a lot of work but its really worth it :) 
Sorry if its too long but I hope you make one and share your tart as well! 
Also I use SI units but 1 ounce = 28grams so you can make conversions if needed. 

Fruits: nectarines, white peaches(apple looking peaches?), raspberries and blueberries. 

Sucree dough (paté sucreé) 
-150g unsalted butter 
-110g powdered sugar 
-1 egg
-lemon/orange zest 
-250g flour 
-1tsp salt 

Creme butter+sugar until pale, add egg and zest, mix well, add flour+salt and mix just until combined. 
I use plastic wrap to wrap it into a square shape trying to not touch very much. Refrigerate dough for ~15 min 
Spread dough on a tart mould (try to touch it the least since you don’t want flour to activate and not transfer heat from your hands, you can spread it between two parchment papers and a rolling pin)
Pinch the dough with a fork so it cooks evenly and without air bubbles forming underneath during cooking. 
Again refrigerate until hard (15-20 min) and you can even freeze the dough then cook for ~15 min in a preheated oven @180. It’ll be ready when it starts browning around the edges. 
(Maybe it can take more or less time depending on your oven) 


Pastry creme 
-3 egg yolks
-2 tablespoons cornstarch
-3tbsp sugar 
Mixed well 

-1cup of milk warmed in a pot. (I like to add orange zest for the flavor :) but you can add lemon or a vainilla bean) 
When milk barely starts making boiling bubbles in the sides you pour slowly into the yolk mixture mixing constantly so yolks wont cook so fast. Then return into the pot to cook the creme. Mix constantly until it thickens and keep stirring for 2-3 mins to ensure all cornstarch is cooked through. Turn of heat, add a tbsp of butter and set into a plate to cool down. Cover with plastic wrap touching the creme so it wont make a hard shell on top. 

When you can manipulate the mould easily, take the crust out and plate it. Fill with pastry creme, spread evenly (I don’t usually wait until its completely cooled down but shouldn’t be straight from the pot) and then have fun arranging the fruit anyway you want! 


Sidenote: for this big mould I use double the recipe of pastry creme with a few arrangements: 2 cups of milk, 3tbsp cornstarch and 4 yolks because I feel 6 is too much 😬 it turns out good just a little pale than the usual recipe. 
Preparing this with alternate milks works out just fine 👌🏻

Also some people cook the dough with parchment paper on top and a cup or two of lentils, beans whatever to make weight so it cooks evenly and without rising, personally I’m just too lazy to do it but if you handle the dough properly and refrigerate then freeze well enough you can skip that, but cant skip the refrigerating part)

Sorry if its too messy, english is not my first language ",2018-02-19 00:51:59

7hajxt,"-Six cups of sliced apples
-2 cups of sugar
-1 tablespoon of flour
-cinnamon / nutmeg / allspice / whichever you prefer to taste
-squeeze of lemon and some lemon zest
-a pinch of salt 
-1 pie crust
-sheet sugar cookie sheet

Preheat oven to 350, roll out cookie sheet until similar to traditional pie crust, prebake cookie sheet over an 8 inch baking round on top of parchment paper to help creat desired shape and bottom pie crust for 15 mins or until slightly hardened. Meanwhile mix other ingredients in a large bowl. Pour contents into pie crust bottom covering with cookie sheet top. Cut slits in cookie pie top, brush with milk and sprinkle additional sugar and cinnamon and bake again for 45-60 minutes or until contents are bubbling through the top. The last 25-15 mins of cooking cover pie with foil lining to prevent over browning.

Sorry to ask so many questions, but I got lost here :( 

40 seconds per side in 20 second intervals? So like 40 seconds searing, 20 seconds off heat, 40 seconds searing other side? How many times did you do this?

1100F?! Didn’t really know temps can get that hot 😭 what are you using to reach that temp? What temperature was the grill when you cooked it indirectly?

Last question: 122 was an interesting choice. Isn’t 135 medium rare? You have such a great color there, I definitely want to try to replicate because my local butcher also has wagyu tri tip and this is a great lil recipe!",2020-09-21 17:20:19

11368n1,"Im swedish i have this in my genetic code since birth. Simple, it just takes time (+- 1 hour)🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪

1. Potatoes (make them peeled its worth it)

2. Chop with help of chopsticks (or in a wooden spoon) thin slices not all the way through.

3. Place on baking sheet or in an oven safe dish.

4. Spread butter (pretty generously) on the top of each potato.

5. In oven at 225° C for 25 minutes ish

6. Take out of oven.

7. Spread on more butter so it melts down the cracks.

8. Sprinkle salt (i also love to add black pepper) and breadcrumbs on potatoes.

9. Back in the oven for at least 20 minutes or until cooked through depending on their size. 

10. Reward yourself with your freshly made Hasselbackspotatis.",2023-02-16 00:44:47

gpz6ec,"This piqued my interest, because I love their burgers but my literal only complaint is that the cheese is never melted. I'm talkin zero out of 100+ visits over the last decade. Even started taking it to go thinking surely it'd melt wrapped in foil by the time I got home and it still wasn't melted. 😂

Maybe the one near me just sucks at melting cheese",2020-05-25 01:31:33
gpz6ec,Bike wouldn’t hate it.  👌,2020-05-25 07:57:50
gpz6ec,"Lol just using half that amount of cheese will be close to the number of calories some buns have. 

Protein style burgers are not fun to eat to me, it makes eating it a chore. I'd rather run for an hour to burn off the burger than eat a bun free one 😂",2020-05-25 04:20:12
gpz6ec,"Yeah, because that’s where most of the calories were coming from👍🏻",2020-05-25 12:21:44
gpz6ec,"Love this recipe!

 I substituted the hamburger for chicken, didn't have any pepper so had to sub cayenne.  Since I was already in the spice cabinet I threw in a bit of onion powder, garlic powder, dried thyme, basil, rosemary and of course basil ( hubby loves it 🥰 ). 

Overall, love the recipe, and my kids absolutely *devoured* it!  Hey, I guess that means easier clean up, right? 😜

de32ee,"Thanks for the comments guys. I'll post the recipe when I get back from the pub. 

I've never actually written it down, it was handed down by my Grandmother and a lot of it is intuitive. Hopefully you get as much enjoyment out of it as I do, if you decide to give it a go.

Edit 1: Here's the recipe. I'm by no means used to writing recipes, or cooking precisely, so apologies in advance if it's a bit vague.

Edit 2: I think it's fair to say that this blew up. In a world filled with all manner of bullshit, honest hearty food cuts through it all. My Nana raised us on this stuff, and my two boys will be brought up on it too. If you're ever in Wales, be sure to give it a try 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿! 

**Ingredients**


- 1kg of rolled lamb shoulder


- 500g lamb leg


- 2 large leeks


- 1 large swede


- Fresh rosemary


- Fresh thyme


- 1kg of maris piper/marabel potatoes


- 5 large carrots


- Salt and black pepper


- Salted butter


- Tiger bread


- Vegetable stock (we use our own frozen stock but a cube is fine) 


**Prepping the lamb**


Hokay, so. Cawl is all about getting the stock right, and to do that you need the right amount of fat content in the lamb, and the right amount of water. I choose shoulder for its fat content, and leg for its big thick chunks of meat. Dice the shoulder and the leg meat into cubes. The shoulder cubes will be smaller and have a thin layer of fat on the top of most of the cubes - this is fine and forms the flavour of the stock. The leg meat should be relatively fat free, and a lot chunkier. Too much fat and the stock is too greasy. Too little and it gets watery. The kicker is there's no way of finding out until you let it rest for 24 hours after cooking, so it's trial and error.


**Prepping the veg**


- I've said a kg of potatoes but I'm really not sure how much I put in. Wash them, peel them and cut them in half. The potatoes should be curved one end and flat on the other but it doesn't really matter, as long as they are the same size.


- Peel, wash and cut the swede into cubes that are about half the size of the potatoes, but again, size doesn't matter (stop, please).


- Wash the leeks, chop an inch off the white end near the root and take the green part off until a few inches above where it meets the white part. Chop the white part into round slices and set to one side. Rough chop the green part and separate that too.


- Peel, wash and chop the carrots into round slices. 

**Cooking**


- Season the meat with salt and black pepper.


- Put both cuts in a large pan/cauldron, bones'n'all, cover with water and add a few more inches of water


- Bring to the boil and simmer gently for 20 mins


- Take the pan off the heat, let it cool and remove the lamb


- At this stage, you can let it cool overnight and skim the fat if you think it's too much, but you're also OK just carrying on


- Add the potatoes, swede, white leek, carrot and veg stock. Season again 

- Add more water if required. The contents shouldn't be swimming freely in the stock, but they should be covered. 


- Bring to the boil, cover and simmer gently for 20 mins 


- Add the green leek, thyme, rosemary and put the lamb back in


- Cover and simmer for a further 15 mins. Stir occasionally. Taste the stock for seasoning


- Take off the heat and leave, cover the pan and leave it on top of the stove for at least 12 hours


- Take out the bones. Serve with cheese (we use all different kinds in Wales, but Welsh cheddar is my favourite) and thickly sliced tiger bread smothered in salted butter.

There are lots of different ways to make cawl in Wales. Some heathens serve the stock separately, some use lamb neck (usually restaurants) and some mix up their veg game with onions and even a few parnsips. It's all about the broth. Welsh food is very simple and homely, as one would expect from a predominantly rural country. There's nothing better on long winter nights! Enjoy.",2019-10-06 15:26:18

I was devastated but my husband was elated because he couldn't stand the smell of my frying it up.

I was introduced to these in a gourmet restaurant that I was lucky enough to serve tables in my early 20’s.  I learned so much.  I started there eating all steaks very well done....by the time I left, I demanded rare steaks, understood the magic of a demi glaze, developed a life long appreciation for red wine and an obsession with charcuterie boards!!!!

825qcc,"I am the sous chef at a restaurant/charcuterie in Spokane, WA. Fortunate enough to cook at James beard house with this establishment twice. We hang our prosciutto in a completely uncontrolled basement of our building, and countless other varieties of charcuterie sit on a sheet-pan with a rack in the fridge to age. Am I saying that is ideal? No. But just for anybody who wants to dabble in curing and aging, I can tell you to not be deterred by a necessity for ""perfect"" conditions"". Let's not forget that the initial refinement of meat preservation was with minimal control of environment. So get in there, and play with some meat!

All of that being said, if you have the passion and the means to make an awesome aging space, DO IT! It's great fun,  and even more rewarding to geek out,  and create something of your own for meat perfection 😊",2018-03-06 04:02:13

Edit: maybe try 50 50 on the chickpeas. just from sound I feel like that would overpower the tabbouleh, but if it tasted good the first time around that's great.",2018-01-14 19:53:50

8rnivx,"How is the 🍜? I am a bit of a ramen snob. I like to try different places. And try to fine my favorite bowl of Ramen. So far it's a seasonal Ramen, charred thick chasu pork. From a little hole in the wall ramen shop in city of industry, ca. It's called ramen yukino ya.

It's an old little Japanese guy. That runs it. It's almost like watching art being made when you sit at the bar",2018-06-17 05:23:52

8rnivx,"Misoya, ichifuku and I can’t remember the last one but it was a hole in the wall. Ichifuku did not go well, I asked for the one with black garlic oil and they PUT black garlic oil. So much so that the dish was overpowered and ruined 😩
Misoya was ok, loved their pork though!",2018-06-17 05:03:31
8rnivx,"Honestly, I agree. The sushi isn’t bad from what I’ve had, but realistically, I don’t think I know what good sushi should be so I’m not a great informant for that. Every other Asian place is “ehh” for me. Soup dumplings are also an obsession of mine and the best so far was in the basement of a rundown building and really sketchy place. Haven’t been able to remember where it was since, so the hunt continues!

Actually, my uncle runs a Venezuelan restaurant on Prince Arthur St. crossing St. Laurent. Really amazing shit! Boccadillos is another awesome place! I’ll see if I can think of others☺️",2018-06-17 05:10:30

7d0r1m,"It's also a little more complicated. I read that both the almond and coconut versions referred to in the English dictionary refer to a more dense style of cookie, which is not the same as the meringue-like Parisian sandwich cookie creation. So you would have to say French-style macaroon to be safe, at which point I don't understand the waste of syllables to be ""technically correct,"" when you could just call it a macaron and be sure you are correct and don't sound like an uncultured American. Things evolved differently in different parts of the world, including cookies. I never thought I would know so much about the origin of this cookie name, but in trying to figure out why this person insists they're synonymous, I went down the research rabbit hole yesterday. 🤓",2017-11-16 10:00:44
7d0r1m,"I understand that the English started incorrectly calling them macaroons, but since the style of cookie originates in France, I'm leaning toward the French name always having been correct. It's a French word for a French cookie. We've bastardized lots of words and amended our dictionaries accordingly. You CAN say you had a ""French-style macaroon"" and probably be understood, maybe even ""correct"" by today's American standards, but I'm not convinced a Parisian would consider it correct. Why not just say you had a macaron? If you look up macaron vs macaroon, you'll get a list of results telling you repeatedly how and why they are different. You recognized that there are two different cookies, but at the same time said they're synonymous, both statements can't be true. This seems to explain it all fairly well, and I've reached the limit of the amount of time I'm willing to spend arguing about cookies today. 🤣

g3ukba,Wow that’s amazing! Thank you for the reply I’m quite certain I could never make my own filo- the baklava is the extent of my attempts. I’d be curious to know what that process is like tho if you know of a video or link or wouldn’t mind a brief explanation. Thanks again 😁,2020-04-19 18:11:37

g3ukba,It’s the Algerian Baklava 🇩🇿,2020-04-18 23:07:21
g3ukba,I’m a female actually haha! Y3teek saha ! 💚,2020-04-18 23:21:29
g3ukba,Yeah. That sounds about right. 🤣,2020-04-18 23:32:32
g3ukba,"Oh, as for a tried and true recipe, I don't have anything written down, but I can tell you what I do!

I buy filo from the store, either a local grocery or middle eastern shop will have it. We use Crisco for the butter, or coconut oil depending on who we make it for. Heat it until it's a liquid, then brush it (thinly!) onto the tray. Then put your first layer of filo on. Keep doing that basically until you get through... 3/4 of your first pack? Then I add the nut mixture.

To make the nut mixture, I grind pecans in a food processor, and add cinnamon and sugar to taste. I spread a thin layer of this over the (buttered/Crisco'd) filo, then add one layer of filo, then one more of nuts. (So, two nut layers total.) My mom likes a lot of nuts but I prefer the dough, so the filling amount is somewhat optional. Just know that hers break in halves and mine don't 😏

Then the remaining filo pack and one whole new one. Butter the top, cut it, then put it in the oven. I put it at 350, but I'm not sure for how long. I check the tops. They should be crisped up, flaky, and golden brown. Maybe 21 minutes...?

Take it out and let it cool. If you want to eat it then, pour syrup on it when it is slightly warm. If you want to eat it in a few days, or if you are mailing it to someone, wait until it is completely cooled to add the syrup to keep as much crispiness as you can. You may need to tilt the pan to drain excess syrup so it doesn't get soggy.

To make the syrup, I just use two parts sugar to one part water, add a splash of rose water and lemon, and put it over heat. I don't recommend stirring, and it doesn't need to sit long. Keep an eye on it at this part, because I once left it on and forgot about it and was scraping my hands raw trying to scrub off crystalized sugar from the bottom of the pot. 0/10 don't recommend. Syrup should be a light golden color once done and cooled. It should be COOL when you add it to the baklava.

I hope that helps and doesn't lead you astray! I recommend looking up a recipe for guidance on times, and use the tips here as applicable :D",2020-04-19 06:33:16

I don’t know what the job opportunities are where you are, for someone who hasn’t been to culinary school, but here in Norway it would be hard to get a job as a pastry chef without an education or at least a really good portfolio. You also have to remember that it is expensive to get equipment and ingredients to teach yourself everything, it is also very time consuming, especially working in a home kitchen. If you can’t go to culinary school, maybe try to get to know a local pastry chef, get a job at a bakery/patisserie and work hard at home to teach yourself, and show interest and a willingness to learn. I don’t know if that is good advice, but I really hope you get to where you want!❤️",2021-05-31 19:26:49

avixh0,I think I’m in love 😍,2019-02-28 00:35:10
avixh0,"Once when I was in high school, my aunt knew I loved eating sushi but I would never be able to eat as much as I wanted to. So she found some sort of groupon deal and bought me a “limitless” menu where I would have as much sushi as I desire from a restricted menu. It was a Friday after school and I went to the restaurant on my own and started eating at 5 pm. I ate about 65 pieces of sushi and used 1.5 standard bottles of soy sauce. It was 8 pm when I was done, my aunt and my cousin joined me and they had their separate meals. I was proud/ashamed that I had made so many orders to the same waitress.

To this day, I am not sure how I didn’t had a sushi coma, or at least a stomach pump.

I LOVE SUSHI 🍣 ",2019-02-28 01:24:15
avixh0,Could not be more real. The moment I looked at this picture I thought about my love for sushi and my bank balance. Life is unfair 🤷🏼‍♀️,2019-02-28 12:39:02

avixh0,"Raw fish is definitely not safe. Where do you live that this IS okay? Raw fish is riddled with parasites, bacteria and microorganisms. You have to specifically find sashimi grade fish that’s basically cleaned and frozen straight away. If you don’t believe us feel free to go to the store and eat some salmon straight from the deli. 😊",2019-02-27 23:41:28

iv4irr,"☕ Coffee Bean Cookies

Ingredients: 

15g Hot milk, 7g Instant coffee powder, 100g Unsalted butter, 90g Powdered sugar, 1 Egg yolk, 155g Cake flour, 15g Cocoa powder, 30g Corn starch 

Procedure:

1. Mix hot milk and instant coffee powder. I used hot water instead.

2. Cream butter and powdered sugar.

3. Add the yolk and coffee mixture.

4. Sift these ingredients: cake flour, cocoa powder, and corn starch. Mix everything well.

5. Make long, round or oval little doughs and slice a little bit of the top. The number of cookies you can make depends on the dough size.

6. Put in the freezer for 30 mins or fridge/chiller for 50 mins so they won't lose their shape when baked.

7. Bake at 160 degrees Celsius or 320 degrees Fahrenheit for 12-14 minutes. If you're not satisfied with the cracks at the top, mark/slice them while they're warm and soft. 

Shelf life according to what I read is 2-3 weeks.



🍫🍪 Chocolate Chunk Cookies

I used this https://youtu.be/4u3244jOU6s and adjusted accordingly. For the flour I replaced the 1/4 apf with cake flour. Do modify according to your preference still! And chill the dough overnight before baking!!!

I added the rice and fried it a bit as well, then deglazing with white wine. I added the quick shrimp broth bit my bit, stirring occasionally, until done.

hab9ls,"Ingredients 🔪 

FOR THE CHICKEN & DREDGE
4 boneless & skinless chicken thighs,
1 tablespoon of sriracha,
1 cup of flour,
1 cup of tropics hot & spicy chicken fry mix,
1/2 cup of cornflour,
1/2 of a bottle of beer (your choice),
1 litre of vegetable oil

FOR THE BISCUITS
1 & 1/3 cup of flour,
3 tablespoons of finely chopped chives,
1 & 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda,
1/2 of teaspoon baking powder,
60 grams of cold unsalted butter,
100 grams of sour cream (more if its too dry)

FOR THE CHIPOTLE HONEY BUTTER
3 tablespoons of room temp unsalted butter,
1 heaped tablespoon of honey,
1/4 teaspoon of chipotle paste,
1/4 teaspoon of sriracha, 
1 pinch of ancho chilli powder


.
Method 🔪

Preheat oven to 200 and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper

Now you want to put all the dry ingredients inc the chives into a bowl then give a whisk to combine. Dice up the butter into small cubes then add and start to chop up using 2 knives whilst combining with the dry ingredients until the mixture starts to look crumbly. Then add the sour cream and combine until it comes together. It should be quite sticky but if it isn’t then you need to add more sour cream.

Now tip out dough onto a flour worked surface and knead a few times. It should look like scone dough. Roll out to about 1inch thick and cut out 2 circles with a 4 inch pastry cutter (or the largest you have) then you will have to re-roll for the remaining 2. Place these onto your baking sheet and then bake on the middle shelf for about 9-11 minutes or til nice and golden brown.

To make the butter you want to just add everything into a bowl and combine until you have nice uniform colour and consistency.

For the chicken you want to remove any excess skin etc and make them flat as possible. You don’t want to hammer them out but just try and make them as even thickness as you can get. Put them into a bowl and add the sriracha and give a good mix then fling them in the fridge for an hour.

We will have a wet and dry dredge for these chicken thighs and to make the dry part we want to add the cup fo flour, half cup of cornflour and half of the cup of tropics fry mix and whisk together then set aside.

For the wet batter we want to add the remaining half cup of tropics into a bowl then start pouring the beer in and mixing together until we get a nice runny batter, I guess the consistency of tinned tomato soup is what you are looking for.

Remove the chicken from the fridge and now get your oil into a medium sized pan and get it on the heat. We are looking for a temp of 170c/350f to fry this chicken (I use a thermometer just to be sure)

When your oil is nearly up to temp we want to take a chicken thigh and lightly coat it in the dry mix then shake off any excess and then into the wet mix and then let the any excess drip off from that and now back into the dry mix where we want to get it properly coated and no wet parts left then place into the oil. 

I fried these 2 at a time as you don’t want to overcrowd the pan and bring the temperature of the oil down. The chicken will take about 7-8 minutes or until its nice and golden brown and you can always temp probe if you aren’t sure and it should be 74degrees or over then lift it out and place onto a wire rack and spoon a good heaped teaspoon of the butter straight on top and spread evenly as it melts.

Split the biscuits in half and place your chicken on the bottom and a wee bit more butter on the lid and eat away.",2020-06-16 19:50:21

2. At what altitude were you cooking the cheesecake? If you’re not sure, where were you when you cooked it?and I’ll look up the altitude :).

3. Do you have any recommendations for the type of blackberry juice you used?

I think that covers all of it 😆. Thank you so much for the recipe!! I love cheesecake and wanted to try something a little different. I’ve only made cheesecake once for my best friend and she loved it, so I think it’s time for the next step!! Lol",2018-11-27 16:59:50

When you say vinegar based, do you mean the barbecue sauce...... Or the Mac? 😬",2019-01-27 04:54:59
ak3ic3,"🤙👍

The barbecue sauce is vinegar based, which is unusual for Texas, so it’s a good stop to mix it up. I like all sauces, whether we’re talking smoky, thick and sweet, or tangy and mustardy, but I’m a NC native and grew up on the vinegar based stuff so it’s my favorite.

fl04ox,"We didn’t really use a recipe, but the crust is a pâte sucrée with 20% of the flour replaced with cocoa powder. You blind bake that and then fill it with three different layers. The bottom is a ganache with chopped up hazelnuts. The middle is feuilletine mixed with hazelnut butter. And the top is plain ganache. Hope this helps! I also documented the process and you can follow along here:

 [chocolate hazelnut tart step by step](https://imgur.com/gallery/NfqKYQo)


EDIT: Wow!! Thanks for the gold. Stay safe and healthy everyone 🙂

EDIT 2: Thank you for all the love! Many have asked for a more detailed recipe and here is what we have. Keep on baking, my friends! 

This is the only recipe we used and it’s for the crust. It’s a pâte sucrée, a classic, French, sweet tart dough. We do most of it by weight:

13 7/8 oz bread flour (we swapped out 20% of this for cocoa powder)
5 5/8 oz powdered sugar
1/2 tsp baking powder
6 7/8 oz butter
3 1/2 oz egg
2 1/8 oz almond flour

1. Sift the flour, powdered sugar, and baking powder
2. Process the butter into the flour mixture until crumbly
3. Add in the egg until just combined.
4. Fold in the almond flour
5. Chill for at least two hours. Then roll it out and form it into the tart shell. Dock the dough and chill again for 30 minutes before baking. 
6. Bake at 325 for 10-12 minutes. 

Otherwise the ganache is equal parts cream (brought to a simmer and poured over) 60% dark chocolate, then stirred together until smooth. The rest of the step by step instructions show how it is assembled, but we just eyeballed the ratios.",2020-03-19 01:28:58

hy83xi,"I like a thick tzatziki/lebne, so I usually mix up all the ingredients (including the cucumber) and then put it in the cheesrcloth overnight. If it's too thick I stir a little of the whey back in, but usually it's perfect. I don't always have feta on hand so a thicker yogurt cheese stands for both. 😊",2020-08-08 16:08:20

Then he gets home and spends an hour preparing the platter alone, organizing the cheese wedges in a perfect formation, throwing a bunch of random herbs around, again, for that exotic factor, and taking 40 pictures of it. He chooses the best picture and posts it online for circlejerk points.

kwsroe,"Thank you - also for context 👍

No need to justify (anything actually/) letting freash scallops go to waste. If I had been in this situation, with the same ingredients at hand and if I could perfectly sear a scallop (which I can't), I would've swallowed my faux-Italian pride and done the same. No stranger to improvisation here, but on less winning levels ;)

And apologies for phrasing my original comment in an assy way - the intent was really ""just"" to nitpick on the dish combo, not to question your professionalism.",2021-01-15 02:04:50

Anyone from the Louisiana region who speaks French or Creole is Cajun. That's the definition, so if you want to be a tight ass about it, at least go by the literal definition.

Where can one get ground lamb? 🤔

6vf24t,I was waiting for this comment 🌊🌊🌊 ,2017-08-23 15:05:00
6vf24t,"Yes, I live in the US. 

also, I've noticed dill is really fucking good on a leg of lamb with some garlic, thyme, pepper, salt and splash of olive oil. 😍 that's the only way anyone can get me to eat lamb. Although we bought a young lamb (6 months old) had it butchered and it wasn't very gamey and it tasted heavenly. 😩 those two times I had it over the years were the best times I've had lamb. 

I don't own a meat grinder either so I can't exactly make my own ground lamb. :( 

Edit: a word rhyme to thyme. Lol",2017-08-23 11:33:21

But! I'd be hesitant to call it Swedish in a heartbeat. (That combo of sauce/gravy with noodles in particular... Just no. Leave our balls out if it. That's blasphemy ha ha😂)

Salt and pepper medium grain. Paprika, tiny bit of chilli flakes. Brown sugar if you want but I didn't this time. 

Ribs washed and rubbed.

Smoked for about 4 hours and wrapped in foil final hour with bit of liquid in parcel. When ribs feel limp through foil they're done.

Sliced and served. Sauce on the side. 😉

g5cshs,"It’s my site 😀

Yeah it always annoys me when I have to read a bunch of stuff I don’t care about on a blog and they hide the recipe in the middle. I like to put a little something since a lot of hours goes into these and just putting the recipe doesn’t always give me the same level of satisfaction. Some people might be interested in the process though. 

But I also don’t have ads or sponsors, so I don’t really care how much people read or how long they stay on my pages.",2020-04-21 23:57:08

My dad taught me how to make rice So here is what he would say is a must for “fluffy” rice: 
1- get the correct rice. This is probably Basmati rice? OP what rice are you using!? 
You wouldn’t get these results if you were using sticky rice for example.  
2- wash your rice please!!! I mean it. Really wash it. 
3- flash fry the rice before you add water/broth to it. 
4- 1cup rice means 2 cups water. 2 cups rice means 4 cups of water. No more No less.  Once you have added everything you need to it then we cover the rice and don’t stir. nope. No touchy touchy. 
5- bring it a heavy boil while covered then kill the  heat. Leave it on the heated stovetop though. 
DONT TOUCH THAT LID until the rice is fully cooked which from this point could take another 10-15 mins. That steam in there is going to make sure your rice is cooked throughly and not dry.

I taught me best friend who is American to eat with his hand and when everyone around us was using cutlery he thought I was playing a prank on him 😂,2022-02-18 08:18:34

The eggs, mushrooms, and steak are no-doubt great on their own, but you’re probably going to have some yolk left behind, right?

Mixing the occasional bite of steak and shroom into  varying concentrations of yolk/sriracha sounds like a good way to shake up the pallet and stave off monotony without over-powering the other flavors.

ni3cxx,"> Just look up synonymous in the dictionary rather than incorrectly guessing that I’m dumber than you

😁 Good try. I can look up synonymous easily, but what I struggled to find in the dictionary was ""synonym rolls"" because it wasn't in there. You can't just make up terms and say ""yeah that's a synonym of something else."" 

I've made a new word: Mbinkunym. A Mbinkunym is a synonym for synonym, except a Mbinkunym is a made-up term that doesn't actually mean anything outside the very specific context in which the term is defined, such as in this very sentence. So a Mbinkunym is a Mbinkunym for synonym 😁

mr15e1,"Wow!!!! I did not expect to get so many upvotes on this!!! Thank you all so much for loving my cake bites 😃
To answer a few questions:
I used the linked recipe for the carrot cake

I added apple pie spice, ginger and fresh nutmeg into my vanilla buttercream to get my spiced butter cream. TBH the nutmeg is the star of the frosting though. 

You can barely taste the white chocolate with all of the other flavors going on. 

These are just the perfect size to satisfy a craving of delicious cake without having to eat a whole slice (cuz how horrible would that be?🤪)

75gg7k,"Oh my the memories! I had a very similar looking ramen in Beijing, and actually they did warn me when I first ordered it, asking if I choose it knowingly because it is really really too spicy. Being a Turkish person and from east Turkey at that, (which is famous for spicy food) I was like ""too spicy? Pfft bring it on""... It was a local small restaurant in an alley, and after this talk with waiter, and aldo since I was probably the only foreigner that came there, needless to say everybody was watching me when my spicy ramen arrived. It was late and there wasn't much customer too so even the cook came out of kitchen to watch me, to see if the petite foreigner girl who ordered spicy ramen can handle it or not. Well, they were right! It was supeeer spicy to the point that  it was not possible for a human being to hold back tears. But everybody was watching and I didn't want to stop eating and prove their expectations right, (in other words stupid ""I can eat spicy food pride"" got the best of me!) so I did eat all ramen but drinking two beers in the process and  and hoping nobody noticing how much napkin I'm using to handle all the fluid coming from my eyes and nose. But still, no regrets, 10 out of 10 will order again 😆👍🏻",2017-10-10 20:52:19

7itz4b,"Hey guys! It turns out it’s totally my fault that you couldn’t view my recipe in the comments because I’d included a link that isn’t allowed. Thank you to the Mod for informing me! SO - here is the recipe, with the link edited out & replaced with the title/name of where to find it ☺️ also, I apologise if this comes out as a wall of text - I’m on mobile & the formatting is nicely spaced for me but I’ve seen it squashes together for other people. I am happy to send people the recipe directly if you send me a message. 

I’m from the UK so measurements would have to be converted for anywhere else, I’m sorry!

For the filling:
400g pack sausage meat
1 white onion 
1/2tsp paprika powder
1/2tsp dried parsley 
50ml cold water
Salt & pepper to season

Method and recipe for pastry is “Puff Pastry” by Caroline Hire on the BBC Good Food website.  Or you could use ready-rolled puff pastry.

1 beaten egg for brushing.
 
Method:
- Make your pastry an hour ahead of time, per the recipe above.
- Slice your onion pretty much however you like, just cook on a medium heat with a splash of oil in a frying pan until it’s all soft and caramelised. I slice mine quite thin. Put to the side to cool.
-Preheat oven to 180 degrees (that’s for a fan oven).
- Line an oven tray with baking paper.
- Roll the pastry out on a floured surface into a rectangle, I’d say about 40cm by 30cm. Slice it in half longways so you have two long strips of pastry.
- In a bowl, place all of your filling ingredients & squish it all together with your fingers until evenly mixed (it’s messy!).
- Half the meat and shape it into two long sausage shapes along the pastry strips, all the way to the ends. Don’t place the meat in the middle of the strips, place them closer towards the bottom, about 1cm from the edge.
- Brush the top edge of the pastry with beaten egg.
- Roll the pastry tightly over the meat, starting from the bottom, all the way over and give it a gentle squeeze to make sure it’s all tight. The other edge/seam of the pastry should now be on the bottom of your super long sausage rolls!
- Slice each roll into ten even portions, to make 20 rolls in total.
- Brush them all over the top with beaten egg.
- Place onto baking tray, seam side down, a few cms apart from each other. 
- You can score the top a little with a knife, it’s purely for aesthetics haha.
- Bake for 35minutes, then enjoy!

Hopefully I haven’t forgotten anything & written it all clearly enough! Thanks so much for the interest guys. Good luck with your yummy sausage rolls! ☺️",2017-12-10 17:48:09

6wcjfp,"It's almost like different people find different things funny. 😱

If people are forcing uninterested parties into staring at pictures of their kids (or anything else) that's a whole separate issue from the actual activity. 

Believe it or not, to a lot of parents, watching babies (yours or someone else's that you care about) explore food, get messy and make faces as they taste stuff is fun. And birthday parties aren't typically about being practical anyway--cake in itself is a luxury. 

I have a group of friends that are like family. I have actual family. And we are all invested enough in each others' lives and families to enjoy a tradition like that. 

Doesn't mean you have to. But shitting all over something someone else enjoys because you don't understand it or don't care about it is a little ridiculous. ",2017-08-27 20:50:54

i6hs38,😍,2020-08-10 06:51:57
i6hs38,"It was super simple! 

Sauce: 2 cups of heavy cream, a stick of butter, about 2 cups of parmesan, salt and pepper and about a tablespoon of garlic. Once that was ready, I added in 1 chopped crown of broccoli and let it cook in the sauce for about 5 minutes. 

For the chicken, I just gave them a dip in eggs real quick then into Progresso italian breadcrumbs. I also let them hang out for about 10 minutes before cooking so the breadcrumbs wouldn't fall off. 

Hope this helps!! 😊",2020-08-09 12:50:04

It’s fully cooked, not rare. The color comes from the curing process (pink salt) and from smoking. It’s not something you’d typically find in a deli either, most likely at a BBQ joint or homemade (like this). 

Generally you’d see it served with greens, beans, slaw, cornbread, pretty much whatever BBQ staple you’d want.

96h3yv,"Awesome! I’m glad to hear they turned out well. I think using parchment is to prevent the caramel from sticking to the bottom and sides. As for the difference in pans, I think metal will be okay to sub but you might need to add a few minutes. The center will be rather fluid when you remove it from the oven, but let it rest overnight and it should stiffen up just fine. 

I would also highly suggest keeping them in the fridge to avoid the caramel from draining to the bottom of the pan. 

I hope this helps and happy eating! 💕",2018-08-26 19:17:54

8f1skz,😮Where are you buying lobster for $1.49/lb?,2018-04-26 16:03:49
8f1skz,"Lobstermen can be wealthy, but I know plenty who are struggling. The ones who do really well are hauling from 3am until early evening and sometimes later. 

I don’t know current prices, but fresh off the boat can range from $4-6/lb.

Typically the lobstermen sell their entire catch to local grocers/other vendors and they get about a third of what the grocers gouge out of tourists. It’s time consuming for them to try and sell directly off the boat, but they will definitely do it if caught coming in from a haul.

Edit: Just remembered working with my bro one summer and we hauled over 500lbs of lobsters to deliver them to a big company that shipped them out. During that time, we were responsible for delivering six 500 lb bait barrels, then hauled the lobster crates that were floating and tied to a dock. We would weight each crate and mark them, then haul to the company. 

I gained a lot of muscle and got plenty of comments about a woman on board. 🙄",2018-04-27 02:17:46

adu7en,"If I may add to this, some Nashvillians, myself included, find this to be really nauseating. Not the food itself. Prince’s and Bolton’s are🔥🔥🔥, but this whole packaging of “Nashville Hot Chicken” is just to sell the ever growing number of awful tourists chicken after they buy cowboy boots, before they get blackout drunk and act insane. Nashville has really taken a turn for the worse the last decade or so as we’ve tried to cater to these people that come visit. The city has lost the really great parts about it and is really only catering to the lowest common denominator. “Nashville Hot Chicken” is the epitome of that. ",2019-01-09 14:52:25

Then couple hours more the next day to decorate.  Not to mention I’m all over the place when I’m baking ... like I’ll be making the meringue in one corner, prepare the batter in another corner and then finishing up in yet another corner of the kitchen 😆.

xzysgx,I keep bees and the way I make hot honey is putting dried chilis and honey in a vacuum sealed bag then tossing it in the sous vide for 6 hours at 125f. When it’s finished you run the honey through cheese cloth. 🤌🤌,2022-10-10 03:16:15

igl9eo,"I use a food processor. You might try baking the pastry in oven for 10 minutes or so before wrapping beef. Usually that keeps the bottom from being soggy.

dnkrs3,The corn husk (or banana leaf) is just what's used to cook them. And it makes them easier to transport. Then you unwrap them. They also add a bit to the flavor and consistency of the tamale. 🙂,2019-10-27 02:06:27

The meat they use in most Latino restaurants in Canada’s is different too.  Meat in Canada is expensive and the spices are different.

qesy51,We love these books so much and we are so excited for the crayon book! I just got a box with the other two in it (we already own them so I’ll donate the duplicates) with a little info card about the crayon one. Sometimes when we get boxes like that from a publisher we get cookies to go with. I’m now sad mine didn’t come with these because wow 😍,2021-10-25 02:21:00

qesy51,It’s fun once you get into it.  I got into it just so I can make cute characters ☺️.  Just take a leap of faith!  You might love it!,2021-10-24 17:41:20
qesy51,Aww!  Glad you can relate.  But then I find other bakes are hard as well as I tried making other things like cakes or cookies but they are just as hard and time consuming 😬,2021-10-24 21:34:18

qesy51,Aww thank you so much!  Yes most macarons are way too sweet.  I don’t usually eat other people’s macarons.  I make mine less sweet and even the filling is less sweet too so you can taste the ingredients and smell the almond fragrant better.  I don’t sell since it’s only a hobby but my friends and their kids love them and always ask for more.  😁❤️,2021-10-24 17:34:09

qesy51,"Lol don’t sell yourself short.  I never knew I could bake nonetheless baking macarons and on top of that making these cute characters!   I have never baked any desserts my entire life before I got into macarons 2.5 yrs ago.  Honestly it just takes a lot of passion, patience and practice. You never know til you try! - cliche but true in my case 😁.",2021-10-25 07:37:51

qesy51,"Aww thank you so much for the sweet and kind comment!!  Hehe I don’t like eating macarons either cuz most of them are way too sweet.  Mine are less sweet than most but I’m sick of eating them too after making them for like 2.5 yrs now.  I give them to friends with kids, kids will just eat anything with sugar in it 😂.  

I think people obsessed over macarons over the fact that it’s finicky to make.  I actually hate macarons before I got into making them cuz too sweet.  But I got into making them just so I can make cute little characters - a kid at heart!",2021-10-24 21:40:46
qesy51,Hehehe aww ur too sweet!  Honestly I only know how to make macarons when it comes to baking and nothing else cuz I suck at everything else 😛,2021-10-24 19:35:37
qesy51,"No these are from children’s books Creepy Carrots, Creepy Pair of Underwear and Creepy Crayon is coming out next year.  😁",2021-10-24 17:28:56

qesy51,🤣 lol trust me I’m not that talented ☺️,2021-10-25 07:10:11
qesy51,"Oh my gosh! I didn’t know he wrote other ones! My children got to meet him and have signed copies of Creepy Carrots from like 2012 or thereabouts. They LOVED that book, and so did my preschoolers where I taught. This makes me want to find some kids to read to 🥰",2021-10-25 04:59:10

qesy51,Hehehe aww and I didn’t know crayon has something to do with Marine.  That’s awesome though! ❤️,2021-10-24 18:07:32
qesy51,$4 for just a round macaron?  Yikes!  That’s the most expensive I’ve heard.  Usually it’s $2 -$2.5 for one.  I’ve sold simpler designs  (with cute face) before for $7 each for a boutique grand opening party.  But I don’t think normal people want to spend that much or more for one cookie 😬,2021-10-24 21:45:08
qesy51,Yes of time permit.  I tried other things before but they just as time consuming and they don’t come out right so I just stick to macarons 😅.,2021-10-24 22:58:26
qesy51,"Ah I used to love cooking too before I got into baking macarons.  I like the aspect of not having to be precised and throwing in whatever you think might taste good.  Nowadays I use the airfryer and instant pot a lot for cooking to save time for baking 🤣.  

I only make macarons and nothing else.  I’ve tried chiffon cake and German butter cookies before.  German butter 🍪 is easy to make and a lot of recipes online.  You can try that first.  They’re tasty too, I would find a recipe with the least amount of sugar cuz I don’t like my desserts too sweet.",2021-10-26 19:23:37
qesy51,Awww sorry you have to see the post twice 😛.,2021-10-26 22:01:50

qesy51,"Aww thank you so much for the sweet and kind comment!  I got into making macarons for characters, I rarely make round macarons so I suck at them.  My circle is more of like oval 😆 and they’re never the same size.  Hurt my wrist to pipe them too.  I admire people that can make thousands of macarons a day.",2021-10-26 19:15:23

Damn... now I’m craving it again.",2018-06-30 10:12:53

aoj9a9,These look amazing! What recipe did you use? I have failed every attempt thus far at macarons 😭,2019-02-08 22:10:39
aoj9a9,"My first attempt at macarons, they were so bad I chucked them in a fire. 😃 it just takes lots of practice, and crying over wasted almond powder and egg whites!

I make Italian macarons, not everyone might have the equipment I use on hand and this is gonna be long but this is the recipe that works for me:

• 200g almond powder
• 200g powdered sugar
• 200g caster sugar
• 150ml egg whites, room temperature 
• 50ml water
• Powdered food colouring of your choice

Grind almond powder and powdered sugar together (*always* blend together or the almonds will be too oily) to make a fine powder, then push through a sieve. If you still have a few larger bits of almond left over then just put them in anyway, you need the exact amount and no one will notice in the grand scheme of things. 

Before making the meringue I always wipe over with vinegar literally anything the egg whites could ever possibly touch, to stop fat from deflating the meringue. It will dry on its own and won't affect the taste!

Split your egg whites into two parts, each 75ml. Set one aside for later, and use the other to make the meringue. In a standing mixer whip this up until soft peaks have formed. Turn off the mixer and pour your water and caster sugar into a pot over the stove. Heat up until the sugar water reaches exactly 118 C, stirring constantly so that the sugar does not burn – use a candy thermometer to tell. Return to the standing mixture and set to medium-high speed, then pour in your sugar water in a thin steady stream down the side of the bowl into the egg whites. It needs to be done slowly to get the right kind of meringue.

You'll need to leave the meringue to whisk until the sides of the mixing bowl have returned to room temperature, and the meringue has slight stiff peaks. You only need them slightly stiff, if you overmix the meringue trying to get really stiff peaks your macaron shells will be hollow. The sides of the bowl might still be a little warm but if the meringue has already reached this stage then turn the mixer off. While the meringue is still mixing, pour your other portion of egg whites into the the almond powder mix and stir until fully combined, this will form a thick paste of sorts.

Once your have your meringue and almond paste, transfer one fifth of the meringue into the paste and fold in with a spatula to loosen up the paste – you don't need to be too careful at this stage, but don't overdo it either. Then take one half of the remaining meringue and fold it gently into the almond mixture, until relatively combined. Take the other half and do the same. 

Here add your powdered food colouring, adding more as you fold depending on your preference. Now start folding, running your spatula along the sides of the bowl and cutting through the middle of the batter and then under one half to fold it onto the other. Keep doing this, with care, until the batter reaches the ""ribbon stage"". Here the batter should run off your spatula in a consistent stream like a ribbon, and still be thick enough to not disappear into the batter for at least ten seconds. You should try not to under-mix or over-mix the batter, but with Italian macarons I think it's better to be on the more under-mixed side rather than over.

Transfer the batter to a piping bag – some people use a nozzle with this but for me I just snip off the end. Line a baking sheet with baking paper and put templates underneath to help you get equal sized shells. Pipe out according to each template, then when the tray is full bang it against the surface to remove excess air bubbles. Poke out larger ones you can see with a toothpick for a better look (you can see the toothpick I used in this photo lol). 

Preheat your oven to Fan 140 C, and leave the macarons out in a warm dry place so that they form a skin on top – you should be able to touch it and not get any batter stuck to your finger. It's important that all the macarons on the tray have a skin formed, otherwise they'll split open in the oven and you'll be sad. ☹️ I put mine in a warming draw set to 25-30 C for about fifteen minutes, that usually works out for me. 

Once the skin has formed place the baking tray in the centre of the preheated oven and cook for 20 minutes – after much trial and error I found cooking them for longer at a lower temperature gave me better results. If you've done it right feet will have formed! Remove from the oven and allow the macarons to cool completely before taking off from the baking paper, if done right they shouldn't stick to it. Repeat with the rest of your batter.

Pair up the shells and then fill them with whatever you want, as long as it's not too watery otherwise this'll ruin your macaron. Sandwich together, and leave in an airtight container for around 48 hours to mature them. You can also freeze these, just give them an hour or so to defrost afterwards and they'll still be good!

That went on, but I get really finnicky with the ones I make so I hope that helps, if at all. :'D",2019-02-08 23:08:38

kpllxp,"There are a lot of recipes you can use so just have fun trying new ideas you come across! I have a few different pasta recipes but my go to is just using durum flour and adding a few whole eggs and then just adding yolks until the consistency of the dough in the mixer is right. I’ll vac seal(or fold again and again if ya don’t have one) to get it all to combine perfectly. Let it proof for a bit and then you can start rolling it out. The most important thing is to have fun and to learn along the way. Food brings us all together and it shouldn’t be so complicated that we get frustrated!

bj3rom,🤔 usually when people say they'd devour something *with something else* that something else is really simple like salt or pasta or vegetables. You chose lobster...,2019-04-30 16:52:54
bj3rom,"I wash it with soap and water.  Then wipe dry, heat on stove or oven (set it to broil or highest temp) to make sure it’s thoroughly dry. Apply a thin coat of oil ALL OVER the pan, including the bottom and handle.  Make sure you really rub the oil in to fill any cracks that may not be visible to the eyes. Then heat it again until the oil has seeped into the surface - there shouldn’t be a film, basically. Then turn off stove or oven and just let it sit on the hot stove or in oven. The second heating with oil takes about 1 hour for me.  May vary depending on the temp or your oven. 

Do not ever ever use those metal scratchy sponges to clean the surface. It will damage it beyond belief.  Use a plastic or the green side of those normal sponges and it should be ok. 

I also sprinkle salt on the hot pan right after I’m done cooking to help scrape off the residues before I hit the water. Salt is a good exfoliator. I use a plastic spatula or something non-metal and not sharp to scrape the gunks off and then use the 🧽. 

Hope that helps!",2019-04-30 19:13:17

kcp5nn,"Welll honestly I just kind of winged it but I will try to explain everything! 

2-3 large carrots peeled and chopped 

4-5 potatoes chopped (I didn’t bother peeling just washed)

Toss in some oil salt and pepper and start to roast these in the oven at around 350° until they’re soft (but not mushy) took maybe 30-40 minutes for me. I stirred them a few times too 

2 stalks of celery chopped (I like mine very fine)

1 onion chopped 

A couple cloves of garlic (I used already minced garlic.. about a tbsp of it) 

Throw the celery, onion and garlic in a pot with some olive oil and cook until they’re translucent. Then add about 5 tbsp of butter and let it melt. Then add about 1/2 a cup of flour and cook it for a couple minutes until it starts getting a bit golden. SLOWLY start adding milk. I probably added about 2 cups of milk. Adding maybe 1/3 of a cup at a time mixing until it’s homogenous and then adding more. Then I added chicken stock.. I only had about a half a container on hand so I added 2 cups of hot water along with some chicken bouillon. 

Then I added two chicken breasts (I had a precooked rotisserie chicken so I just cut that up) 

Then I added some spices (thyme, pepper, a little paprika, garlic powder, a tiny pinch of nutmeg and 2 bay leaves)

Then let it come to a boil, keeping a close eye on it so it doesn’t start sticking to the bottom. It should get nice and thickened up. 

(I also made the biscuits during this so by this time my veggies were soft enough to add) 

Add the carrot and potato, then a can of corn and a can of peas (or frozen corn and peas whatever you like) 

And that was it I think 🤔 I added a touch more milk at the end because mine got quite thick but I do like it THICK 


For the biscuits 

2 cups flour 

1 tbsp baking powder 

1/4 tsp baking soda 

1 tsp salt 

1 tbsp sugar 

Some pepper and thyme (or whatever spices  you like.. or none) 

6 tbsp (85g) cold butter grated 

1 cup buttermilk 

Mix the butter into the dry ingredients first, you don’t want any huge clumps of butter left, just about pea sized. Then add your buttermilk, and turn it out onto a floured cutting board. Make it a rectangle and fold it over in thirds on top of itself a couple times. But be gentle with it, dont want to overwork it too much. Roll it out to about 1/2 an inch thick. Then use a circle cutter (or a glass) to cut out some biscuits, brush the tops with more buttermilk then put them in the oven at 375° F for 8 mins then rotate the pan and put them in for another 8. (They’re done with the tops feel solid in the middle and they’re nice and brown)",2020-12-14 03:27:37
kcp5nn,HA thank you lol. It is such a pet peeve for me when people post a delicious looking food on a stove caked in god knows what 😂😂 so I mean I keep it clean in general but I’m always extra careful to give it a little wipe if I’m going to take a picture,2020-12-14 05:34:31

kcp5nn,I’ve made chicken pot pie so many times (actual pie form) and even though I really like my homemade pie crust.. and I’ve tried a couple crust recipes just to test if I like it better. I just don’t like it with the chicken filling 🤷🏼‍♀️ I always ended up picking the crust off,2020-12-14 14:57:58

b69era,Interesting.  Thanks for sharing this article.  Had an A-ha moment reading it.  I have Celiac disease so I use a GF flour blend.  Adding the pudding has always made the cookies flat.  Now I get why.  Probably need to add more xantham gum to compensate for the pudding . 🤔,2019-03-28 03:43:26

b69era,"I promise, I’m not a professional baker or anything, but I love to make and share delicious things with those that I love, and I also approach baking with a scientific mind! I have been baking since I was 11 years old, so that’s 12 years of scouring food blogs, watching cooking shows, and troubleshooting for problems whenever they come up, and over the years certain things have simply clicked. 

Also, [this website ](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/learn/) has been an invaluable resource to me over the years! King Arthur has plenty of videos that will teach you everything from the difference in chilling your dough for 30 minutes vs. 3 days, to how to account for high elevation in your recipes. I hope it proves to be a great resource to you as well. 

I would love an update on you and your wife’s baking if you do try this recipe again! I sincerely hope they turn out scrumptious for you the next go around. 😊",2019-03-30 06:13:04

7bslc8,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand homemade pizza. The dough recipe is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical cooking most of ingredients the will go over a typical amateur chef’s head. There’s also Paula Deen’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Emeril Lagasse literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these dishes, to realise that they’re not just dank- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike homemade pizzas truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the dankness in Gordon Ramsay’s existential catchphrase “The Focking Bass is Focking Raw,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Coolio’s ghetto epic *Cookin' With Coolio: 5 Star Meals at a 1 Star Price*. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as OP’s genius wit unfolds itself on this subreddit.

aul1e8,❤️🔫,2019-02-25 17:57:38
aul1e8,That mixture sounds amazing. I'll have to try it. My boyfriend and his dad taught me put the bacon (we usually get thick cut) in the oven THEN turn it to 350/400. Once it's up to temp it's about keeping an eye for about 10-15 based off preference. The slow climb of the heat renders the bacon fat and it slowly melts then like fries itself in the super hot heat 😍 give it a shot. You won't regret it. ,2019-02-25 17:17:07

ndtz0t,It can be daunting to be fair! I just shallow fried these in a Dutch oven style pan in about a cm of oil heated to 340 F! I would recommend getting a thermometer to check the oil temp and the chicken temp once it’s fried - they are fairly cheap online 😇,2021-05-17 10:54:42

9d1fu0,The truffle fries are a new addition within the last 8 years probably. Maybe even 5. The resort was remodeled about 8 years ago and it still looks so new to me whenever I go back.

94vi6i,"Not who you replied to but I didn't think this would be that cheap either! I'm in the US -- I shop at Wegmans because in my area it usually has better prices than other stores and better quality produce than the cheapest store (Aldi).

My store's pricing:

* Tomatoes $1.99/lb (~4 to a pound)
* Limes 3/$1.00 ($0.75 each in the winter)
* Jalapeno $1.99/lb (~5 to a pound)
* Red/white onion $1.99/lb (~2 to a pound)
* Cilantro (aka coriander) $1.29/bunch ($1.99 in the winter)

So:

* about 16 tomatoes (4 lb) = $7.96
* 4 limes = $1.33-$3.00
* 2 jalapenos = $0.80
* 1 red onion = $0.99
* 1 bunch of cilantro = $1.29-$1.99
* = $12.37-$14.74, depending on the season

Not saying I wouldn't make it 😁 but prices definitely vary by location!!

j0srht,Aww thank you so much for the sweet and kind comment!  I take too lol to make them so it’s not profitable to sell.  It’s like quality over quantity.  Most bakeries have to go for quantity over quality otherwise they won’t make money 😁.,2020-09-28 00:29:51

j0srht,Aww thank you so much for the sweet and kind comment!  It’s my passionate hobby so I spend a lot of time on them to a point that it won’t be profitable to sell 😆,2020-09-28 01:53:32
j0srht,Aww thank you so much for the sweet and kind comment!   I’m too slow to make them so it won’t be profitable to sell.  There is a bakery near where I live and they make really cute characters too but they make them really fast unlike me 😆.,2020-09-28 02:19:22
j0srht,Aww thank you so much!  I don’t have YouTube but I have a couple videos on my IG (same handle).  I’ll be posting a reel of how I pipe these in a couple days on IG 😁.,2020-09-27 23:38:42

j0srht,"Awww thank you so much for the sweet and kind words!  Honestly I never thought I’m talented cuz my one can make these if they have enough passion, patience and practice.  I used to spend a lot of time practicing when I first started with countless fail batches.  I still have fail batches but not like the beginning.  

But sometimes I do look at my work and think that people gonna say I have too much time on my hand 🤣.",2020-09-28 00:11:40
j0srht,Aww thank you so much for the sweet and kind comment! I make them weekly for my IG acct - same handle - so I’ll post here too weekly 😁.,2020-09-28 02:42:49

j0srht,Aww thank you so much! Happy to hear you like them that much hehe😊,2020-09-28 03:30:26
j0srht,No it’s just a hobby so I don’t sell.  But I do package them and give to deserving friends with kids.  I spend a great deal of money to make them for fun and then buying packaging materials for them too just to give away 🤣.  But I guess all hobbies cost money and I guess it’s well spent when someone else can benefit too.,2020-09-28 03:14:48
j0srht,Aww thank you so much!  😊,2020-09-28 03:32:35

j0srht,"Aww thank you so much!  Most of them I give away to friends with kids.  Some I never filled them and I still have them in boxes (especially all the earlier ones with fondant decoration).   Some I kept to eat, but then I ate like 2 and then ended up trashing the rest when they get too old.  I’m sick of eating them 😆.",2020-09-28 15:40:51
j0srht,Aww thank you so much for the sweet and kind comment!  Trust me I don’t make round macarons well either so I gave up on it long ago and only do shapes 😁.,2020-09-28 15:33:39
j0srht,"Aww thank you so much and happy to hear you enjoy looking at them whenever they pop up.  Honestly no talented needed but require a lot of passion, patience and practice 😊.",2020-09-27 18:17:45

j0srht,If you know anyone is Dallas Texas please let me know! I was hoping you sold 😔,2020-09-28 02:38:03
j0srht,There is an unspoken rule that macarons cost at least $2 USD. 😂,2020-09-28 11:20:07
j0srht,"Oh my goodness, if you sold them you’d be rich 🤑  They are 100% insta worthy! But lucky friends and kids!",2020-09-28 22:49:48
j0srht,I bet! Takes time for decor lol 😆,2020-09-27 19:26:14
j0srht,Awww I would v like to be your friend 😁,2020-09-27 20:51:38
j0srht,I bake at 290F 16 mins furthest from the heat source.  For white I use Sugarflair superwhite powder along with white gel color.  Then once baked I brush on white petal powder - yes I’m overboard with the white 😂...but that’s the only way to make them look whiter.  It’s actually whiter in photo than in person cuz of the lighting.,2020-09-27 23:50:15
j0srht,Oh 🤣🤣🤣 too funny!!,2020-09-27 23:41:17
j0srht,🤣🤣,2020-09-27 20:11:00
j0srht,I take a long time to make them that it’s not profitable to sell.  Plus I have a full time job that is easier to make money than baking 😁.,2020-09-28 01:55:15
j0srht,🥺 just a hobby so I don’t sell.  But I know people I can refer you to if you want to buy.,2020-09-28 02:33:50
j0srht,Aww thank you so much for the sweet and kind comment! I did Gudetama awhile back but they don’t seem to be that popular 😬,2020-09-28 03:34:56
j0srht,"😊 no, it’s just a hobby and I’m just an amateur baker.  I only know how to make macarons only.  I took a basic class at Sur La Table last year and that’s how I got started.",2020-09-28 07:06:13
j0srht,"Then maybe it’s time for you to try shapes 😁.  I kid you not I cannot get circle macarons right.  They’re always wonky, uneven and lopsided so I gave up.  Plus they hurt my wrists to pipe cuz of repetitive motion.",2020-09-28 07:07:43
j0srht,Hehehhe happy to hear you enjoy them 🙏❤️.  Hope you have a wonderful week!,2020-09-28 02:59:31
j0srht,Most people wait about 10 mins.  I don’t wait because I pipe really slow so by the time I come back to the first one it’s already a good 10-15 mins.  Plus I have a tiny fan o put on the counter while I’m piping to help them dry faster.  Yes I draw most of them myself and I give them out to my followers on IG 😁.,2020-09-28 01:52:04
j0srht,Heheheh I get lazy typing and a lot of people called them macs too 😁,2020-09-28 07:00:20
j0srht,Hehehhe it’s not profitable if I sell since I’m too slow making them.  But I do them for IG fun 😁 and I refer people to other bakers I know whenever someone asks me about selling. I guess it’s win-win for everyone 😊.,2020-09-28 23:09:54
j0srht,Aww 🙏❤️🤗!  No it’s just a hobby so I don’t sell but depend on where you live I know bakers I can recommend if you want to buy.,2020-09-28 15:35:14
j0srht,"Aww thank you so much for the sweet and kind words!   I feel like I have to work too hard to make little money if I sell 😅.  I mean people willing to only pay so much for them and I can’t charge an exorbitant amount of money 😆.  Plus I work full time and take care of my elderly mom too so it’s hard to find time to bake.  And when I do, I just for fun to decompressed.",2020-09-28 19:00:30

Not only that, but English Breakfast varies quite drastically depending on where physically in the UK you order it.

You make us look like the Italians when someone says American pizza is good.

hlofi8,"Hmmm bakeries don’t sell them?  They’re made of almond flour, sugar and eggwhite.  They’re slightly crispy outside and soft and chewy inside.  The filling can be either ganache or buttercream and that’s where you get all the diff flavors.  They’re like a delicate taste and one is never enough 😆.  They’re pretty expensive too.  Average about $2-2.75 for one round macaron about 2 inches.",2020-07-05 23:28:24

s1vtis,That’s my experience. If you go out and buy 2 tomatoes and let one of them get “fridge cold” and let the other sit on the counter and then slice them both you will taste the difference. Fresh tomatoes at room temp with a pinch of salt are amazing 😄,2022-01-12 15:34:44

q3k8dc,"I think for me it’s all about how they are cooked.  There’s something about the cooking process.  Maybe it’s the texture like you mentioned.  Raw button mushrooms on a salad, I can eat all day.  But when they are cooked into something like casserole or with a gravy, idk maybe it’s more of the earthy, musky taste that’s released during cooking.  

There is a local deli here that makes a shiitake veggie sandwich that I like, but I obviously don’t know their cooking process.  So since I don’t even have a full grasp on how I like my mushrooms, I usually just avoid them. But, the exception is when I see something that looks too delicious to pass up, like that giant tray of delicious looking potstickers. 😃",2021-10-08 14:28:41

9u8c8a,">  I’m worried I will butcher it if I make it 😍

You can't butcher the recipe because it's real simple.

Dice up a large yellow onion, about 6 celery stalks, and a medium bag of baby carrots.

I saute those in canola oil until the onions are translucent.  Then I toss in 6 chicken cubes (trust me on this, look for either the Knorr or Maggi brand in the Latin section of your supermarket, the cubes are soft, mushy and bigger than regular chicken bouillon cubes) and let it dissolve into the vegetables.  Then I added 3 whole chicken breast and about 10 cups of water.  I brought it to a boil and then reduced the heat to medium for about an hour.

Then I took out the whole chicken breasts and shredded the meat and put everything back including the skin and bones to add more flavor.  Let it simmer for at least another 30 minutes.  Taste the broth and add salt and pepper to taste.  

15 minute before serving, let it go back to a boil and add the egg noodles (I used extra wide egg noodles usually found in the pasta aisle of your store). 

That's it!!!

For an extra flavor boost try the cheese trick. Shred cheese and place directly on a hot pan/skillet. Place tortilla over cheese and cook until cheese is crisp. Once done cheese will adhere to the tortilla and not the pan. 

Transfer to a plate or counter and construct the rest as described.

jj6u37,"Sorry I'm a little late 😅 I just cut the potatoes in half down their longest side, then those halves into halves, then those (now quarters) into thirds. Obviously it'll depend on how phat your spuds are but yeah, you know what a wedge looks like.

Then I toss them onto a baking tray (not overlapping), drizzle olive oil over them, crack salt, pepper and any other herbs/spices you like (I have an all-in-one roasting seasoning that has black pepper, salt, chilli flakes, oregano, thyme, and dried garlic in it), and toss it all together to make sure the wedge cut potato pieces are all evenly coated in the seasoning (so maybe 5% of the total surface area is seasoning speckles) AND very well coated in oil. You don't want oodles of excess oil pooling in the corners of the tray when you tilt it but the wedges should be oiled everywhere, so it's okay for a little oil to remain on the tray in between each wedge.

I cook a couple medium sized potatoes worth in my oven at gas 6 (200°C) for 25 - 30 minutes, but the most important thing about this is that you must turn the wedges halfway through cooking, to get that nice even browning. I personally pick up each individual wedge and flip it so the soggy oily side then becomes the top facing side, rather than tossing the tray around and hoping for the best.

If you give it a go, let me know how it went 👍🏽",2020-11-03 19:57:55

dtf7in,"Sorry to disappoint, he was tested and does not have the genetic markers for autism (so he didn’t inherit it, but thanks for the link). One person didn’t understand your sarcasm and your immediate go-to is autism. That’s where your narrow mindedness comes into play. My kiddo has it tough enough but when peeps like you roll through and make it a joke, you make yourself seem ignorant. But you’re not ignorant, if you have all these links about autism at the ready (and hopefully have read them). My son can’t help that he’s autistic, so making jokes about something people don’t have control over seems petty and small. Maybe the doode lives somewhere that parsley is expensive! Who knows!

10jtmzq,"I've done that, too! Just pan searing the meat. Flavor's all their with the correct spices just the texture is a bit off that's it lol most wouldn't mind of course.

It's the veggies and sauce that makes a gyro to me. Fresh ingredients there will elevate it from good to great! (And the tzatziki sauce!) 

Thanks for the tips tho! I need to make my own pita as well at some point. I know how amazing it is fresh. I just really don't like baking even tho I'm okay at it. It's just messy and I have a small kitchen 🤣

I'll be doing a few gyros tomorrow and then Puerto Rican mofongo later in the week. Mofongo is realll simple!",2023-01-24 10:10:56
10jtmzq,"I appreciate your expertise! I have a local Greek spot half a city away I stop by when I can. :)

This recipe is really all you need:
https://www.thespruceeats.com/traditional-mofongo-recipe-2138186 You'll see it's simple as hell. Can't be messed up lol

Just make sure to bake it at the end for about 15 minutes @ 350°F or so after those steps, especially if you're going to stuff it. Someone in the comments actually mentions it as well. Not wholly necessary but I like to do it especially if I have the oven on already.

Then you can plop that baby down in a bowl and pour some stew, soup, a steak, veggies, really anything around it as it's meant to soak up the flavor and juices of whatever's next to it. Really brings a meal together. But it's fine by itself too, especially stuffed a bit (chicken, pork, beef, fish, cheese – go crazy!) Mofongo is pretty mild so it goes good with a ton of stuff. 👍",2023-01-24 11:24:01

i38smk,"Oh you really want this? Fine. You asked for it.

Save about 6 lbs of beef bones. I prefer bones from porterhouse/t-bones or some oxtails. 

Brown the bones.

Brown 5lbs of chicken quarters seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder.

Brown 3 large onions and 10 cloves of garlic in a pan. I use an Instant Pot but you do you.

Put the chicken and the bones in the pot or pressure cooker with some thyme, basil, bay leaves, onions/garlic, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and a packet of Goya Sazon.

Cook the balls out of it.

Strain out all bones and chicken.

You now have gelatinous stock. Make a roux that fits however much liquid you have. Stir in to stock and now you have gravy.

Set aside half the gravy.

In the remaining gravy emulsify in as much mozzarella, Muenster and Monterey Jack as you can. It can hold a lot. It should be thick like oatmeal.

Spread on cookie sheet and cool. Cut in to cubes or rectangles and place in chilled bowl.

Make cheesy, garlic mashed 🥔. You know how.

Make egg, milk, crumb breading station.

Make a pocket of mashed potatoes and place a cube of cheese-stock and a cube of cheese inside. Roll in to a ball.

Bread in breading station.

Deep fry.

Place finished balls on plate, cover in more shredded cheese, pour over hot gravy, add shredded chicken, more gravy.

The use of real tape never crossed my mind, but then I have a general dislike for mixing mediums (real items and edible foodstuffs) personally. It was more a ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" kind of thought with no backing. To emphasize one of the reasons I like your cake so much as is: it's recognizable and well executed (the tape spooling got mentioned earlier, but I'm referring to the texturework, not the exact replication type details), and if you ever make another one, you should totally go meta and record a time lapse video or montage and totally copy it to VHS. 📼",2017-06-03 02:49:43

kgj26y,"Well my favourite ingredients are often sour. I love lemon and use it for a lot of my recipes. So I love tangy cheese! Goats cheese and aged cheddars are my favourite cheeses.

Also, if you tried making your own ricotta using lemon juice instead of citric acid, I'm sure you'd love the result and this might open you up to enjoy a different side of cheeses! Look it up, it's really easy! It's not very sour, but you are creating the cheese with milk combined to the acid from the lemon! I add salt, a little bit of lemon juice and a some grated garlic at the end in my ricotta.. it's out of this world good 👌",2020-12-20 04:53:43

I went vegan for a few months a couple years ago and some of my most favorite dishes still (to make and eat)are vegan. Thug Kitchen and Plant Based on a Budget are a couple favorites that you might be interested in checking out next month. I agree, not everyone has the luxury to try a vegan diet. I’m also really lucky to live in a city where eating a vegan/plant-based diet isn’t difficult.

y0hcyr,The croissant isn’t so weird. It’s a vector for gravy like a Yorkshire pudding. Just add a side croissant next year and BOOM you’ve got yourself a new tradition. 🦃🥐,2022-10-10 19:45:29
y0hcyr,"As a Turkish person, I can confirm this Turkey is good 🇹🇷 but you could use a side of some Chile 🇨🇱",2022-10-10 21:22:04
y0hcyr,That’s way too much food for someone to consume in one meal 😂,2022-10-11 01:20:42
y0hcyr,"Turkey....,🤮🤮🤮",2022-10-11 05:42:56

y0hcyr,"But a Yorkshire pudding is like a savory pancake. You can always add pancakes to a meal 😉

Why add a bread roll though? It's not even like anyone makes a sandwich using that bread roll...",2022-10-11 05:35:35

g8by31,"cheers pal! I did cheat slightly by using a Katsu sauce kit (golden dragon branded I think)! Super easy for the chicken; bash the fillets so that they're about 2/3cm thick, dip in a flour, paprika, salt, pepper and water mix (get it to a pancake-type consistency), then dip in panko breadcrumbs. Shallow fry in vegetable oil for 5 minutes then flip and do another 5 minutes. Whilst all that's frying, steam some jasmine rice and cook the sauce (or heat through for my fellow cheaters). 

I channelled my inner Jamie Oliver by potting the rice in a ramekin before plating to make it look a little nicer, then sprinkle over some sliced spring onions (scallions for my friends across the pond), and bon appetit ♥️",2020-04-26 16:26:26

k1zb4m,😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🥵🥵🥵🥵,2020-11-28 01:47:21
k1zb4m,"Dunno if OP will see your comment but I can get this kind of result consistently with just a huge spatula and a dowel/hammer/anything with weight. 

Heat a pan with a big flat bottom up to mid heat, cast iron is best, and pop down a ball of meat right in the middle. Grab your big ol’ spatula/weighted tool and press that ball of meat as flat as you can get it, and I mean FLAT. Move the spatula around in a circular motion while you’re pressing to get an even spread, but roundness isn’t really something to prioritize. Give it about two minutes undisturbed in the pan and you’ll see that it’ll have reduced in diameter. When it hits that point and you see some of the fat/juices start to look more matte than glossy, that’s when you flip it and slap a piece of cheese on the side you just cooked. When the cheese is just past the point of taking the shape of the burger, it’s good to go. This shouldn’t take more than 5 minutes tops. 

Some other tips just from my own personal experience:
When the meat goes in the pan, I find having it refrigerator cold is best as it’ll retain more moisture. If you have to use frozen meat, leave it out to thaw but don’t let it reach room temp if you can help it.

Seasoning goes on once the ball is in the pan but before you press it flat. I’ve accidentally hit McDonalds flavour a few times from just balancing salt and cracked black pepper so don’t assume you need anything more than that. The way I do it is a two finger pinch of sea salt, and 5 turns of an awful pepper grinder. When the spatula comes down, all of that it gonna get spread out with the meat and then the fat/juice is gonna pick it up and it’ll fry into the uncooked side when the burger gets flipped.

Good luck and if you don’t get it the first few time, just keep practicing and re-tooling the technique until it works!
