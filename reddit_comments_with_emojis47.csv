7elxew,"It's not about one service taking more GB. 

In the electricity analogy, it would be like your electricity provider being able to dictate how the electricity is used, based on further than the amount of electricity used.

----------

Imagine your electrical company started producing their own ELEC™ brand lightbulbs. But you have Generic™ brand lightbulbs at home.

Your electrical company, without neutrality rules, could provide only half the electricity to your Generic™  brand lightbulbs, making them very dim compared to their own ELEC™ brand. Even it they were the same bulb but for the name.

Or, even worse - they could say ""you used to pay 1$ per minute per bulb, but now for ELEC™ brand bulbs you pay only 80¢ per minute per bulb. Generic™ brands are going to cost 2$ per minute per bulb, regardless of electricity used.""

That could be applied to every appliance in your house. It could very quickly turn into a nightmare with your electrical company having complete control over all your electronics.

Does that make more sense?",2017-11-22 00:51:14
7elxew,"Thank you for providing a reasonable answer to my
simple inquire. You are ""the best answer"". 🍻",2017-11-22 04:28:25
7elxew,"> So no, this is not a partisan issue.

The problem with arguing this point is that it doesn't really matter what the average Republican wants. There could be 50,000,000 Republicans in the United States who don't want to see the FCC fuck around with Net Neutrality. But the 292 people who are supposed to represent them are both the only ones that actually matter *today* and the ones who are on the corporate take to put people like Ajit in place and make things like this happen.

Public polling and Congressional action are near constantly several years apart from each other. Americans overwhelmingly, across party lines, want Net Neutrality to be saved and the way to do that would be to enshrine it in law. But a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of them actually get to make that decision and they are willingly and intentionally disregarding the will of the people on a daily basis.

So *today*, it is very much a partisan issue, because one party will support gutting protections like Net Neutrality and the other party will fight it. And the only fix for it would be to vote out the Republicans next year, else the Republicans that get in the job next year will also continue to gut protections for the average American as they do every time they are in office.

What republicans wan't doesn't matter when **Republicans©™** are in charge.

Edit: What I also meant to point out is that the Republican electorate are ultimately responsible for this. They keep voting in the same terrible people over and over again because ""my guy is great, it's the rest of Congress that's awful."" And the type of GOP candidate that would actually protect Net Neutrality (beside the fact that they'd probably be a Democrat, not a GOP candidate) wouldn't be sufficiently anti-gay, anti-brown people, anti-whatever to survive the primary let alone get elected. Ultimately, it is ""us vs them"" if the them keep shooting themselves in the foot and scream we want to take away their guns when they point the damn things at their heads.",2017-11-22 17:10:24

Like, 6 months ago north Korea was threatening to nuke everything under the sun and tensions between the north and south seemed to be pretty high. Now, all of a sudden, north Korea had become super friendly and is making peace with the south and talking about denuclearization.

> He has no moral compass, he follows no code, he is an untrustworthy and unreliable actor on the world stage and no one from any country can predict what he will do

Why does that even matter? [Trumps tax cuts not only helped the US economy, they helped the *global exonomy*](http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/22/news/economy/imf-trump-tax-cuts-global-economy/index.html).

> It destroys the relationship we have with our allies and does harm that will take decades to repair, but the one up side is that our enemies can't really predict what he'll do either.

Source? Of course not, because our relationships are stronger than ever and is leading to the END of the Korean War.

“IT'S HAPPENING!
Military takedowns and arrests begin this wknd and will continue forward for the next 13 days/nights. Some international raids have already started. Italy has also been found complicit in our election fraud.
Everyone will be getting emergency 🆘 alerts on their phones, tv's, radios & internet. It will override all other broadcasts and could last for several hours at a time. Do not to be scared of what's coming as it is for the safety of our nation for this to unfold. 
DO NOT travel to any large cities (especially Philadelphia) for the rest of the month. Military operations will be taking place in many of the major corrupt cities. People will start rioting once this intel breaks thinking Trump is a military dictator. He only has 13 days to put this dog down.
The implementation of the Insurrection Act began after the raid on the Capitol and was marked by Trump's broadcast to the people to disband and return home. This broadcast wound up being blocked, for the most part, by the media. Nevertheless, his address fulfilled the requirements to initiate the Act.
Marines and National Guard troops are being moved as needed for the riots that will start after the national release of the intel. The intel will be dropped for everyone to see and hear in loops that will be several hours long. The system was just checked by the FCC a few days ago alerting ALL media that they cannot block the flow of intel under federal regs. 
Trump will be moved continuously like a chess piece from now until the 20th in order to avoid any retaliation against him and family.
Trump had to exhaust ALL other means legally before this operation could commence. He gave everyone a fair chance to come clean and they refused.
His press release of a ""smooth transition"" did not include the word, ""concede"" as he has no plans to do so. Rather, there will be a smooth transition of power to his new cabinet, staff and Vice President, General Flynn.

kxnafx,"Answer: Here’s my take on it all... granted this is coming from a ☠️spooky☠️ west coast liberal. The right wing believes ardently what they believe, and so does the left wing... no surprise here. The big problem and actually what’s super interesting is that these big media conglomerates cater to their respective constituencies by feeding them lies. Fox, Breitbart, Qanon, etc and others caters to the right; meanwhile msnbc, cnn, etc cater to the left or are “unbiased” and are willing to propagate conspiracies such as Russiagate. These work in tandem to further pull us apart as a nation when in reality most of the plights of many Americans couldn’t be more similar regardless of which side of the aisle you are on. These big corps distract us from things we should be advocating for, but instead they “pay” legislators to get their constituencies to vote against their interests time and time again... which is why you have many red states have more people on Medicare in proportion to their population compared to blue states. But they will go on tv and tell you how bad it is, when In  reality Medicare (don’t get me wrong Medicare is deeply flawed) is actually super beneficial to those in need. The problem here is deeply corrupt politicians on BOTH SIDES that need to be voted out of office immediately. If you are on the right and think that the dems are corrupt and slimes... YOU ARE RIGHT, but you have to acknowledge that your own party is the SAME, actually they might be worse because they openly advocate against your interest without knowing it, and they gaslight to try and sway your perspective. Regardless of whether ur on the right or the left, the problem lies with big corps, money in politics, and subsequently those tucked legislators that propagate this system.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-russian-bounties-briefing-cia-officials-decided-against/

“But the Times and the Associated Press reported this week the information was included in Mr. Trump's written intelligence”.

He either wasn’t verbally informed because it doesn’t fit his narrative and he’s protective of Putin, AND he doesn’t read his briefings,
OR he knew and chose to not do anything. EITHER WAY he is a failure as the CoC, and has not suggested any concrete retaliatory actions against Russia. Boy he sure is tough on Russia, China, etc. 🙄

America has never been more weak geopolitically right now, but you’re content to eat paste and lick boots. Glad you take the word of trump and Radcliffe you fucking imbecile.

And if you think unverified info is never included in presidential briefs:


https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/07/01/russia-bounty-intel-breakdown-trump-347224#click=https://t.co/c8laP9J3jc

“But top White House officials confirmed to lawmakers this week that the Russian bounty intelligence was included in Trump’s daily written brief in late February, Capitol Hill sources say — even though it had not yet been briefed to the president orally by that point.

Presidential briefers have traditionally tailored briefings to a particular leader’s preferences — in Trump’s case, he prefers to receive the briefings orally, according to several former intelligence officials with knowledge of his style. His public schedule also reveals a haphazard schedule of in-person briefings, unlike past presidents who received them daily and usually first thing in the morning.

But that system has essentially created a two-tier briefing process: the text of the PDB itself, which Trump isn’t known to read, and what the briefer—and more importantly, the president’s senior national security aides — choose to say out loud.


ODNI declined to comment, but former intelligence officials say that’s not how the briefing system normally works —intelligence would not be included in the PDB while simultaneously being too unreliable to brief the president orally about because the assumption is that the president will read the PDB. Moreover, uncorroborated intelligence that the IC has not yet reached a consensus on “is included all the time” in the PDB if it is deemed important enough to be on the president’s radar, said David Priess, a former CIA officer.”

>In August 2018, Knight's father David Challenor was sentenced to 22 years in prison for raping and torturing a 10-year-old girl in the attic of the home shared by him, Aimee and Tina Challenor (his wife and her mother). Knight's father had been reported to the police in 2015 and charged in November 2016. Following this, Knight chose her father as her election agent for the 2017 general election and also the 2018 council elections. Knight had given her father's name as ""Baloo Challenor"" on campaign materials, later commenting that he was known locally by this nickname. After her father's sentencing, Knight – who insisted she did not know the allegations against her father in full – stood down from the Green Party's deputy leadership election.

kjz2g8,"Answer:

Okay, honestly, none of the answers I see here are fully correct.

First: Democrats have been pushing for $1200 or higher checks since May. The House passed a bill for $3.4T that included larger stimulus checks and unemployment payouts, as well as considerable funding for state and local programs. Republicans immediately called the state and local stuff 'pork', despite it being used to fund things like SNAP food benefits and social programs. All they had to do was claim it went to 'poorly funded blue state cities' and that was all that was needed for their base to follow along.

Next: Mitch McConnell has been the sole issue for a very, very long time. The $3.4T bill is still sitting on his desk, and has not even been brought to a vote, which, as senate majority leader, is actually his job. He penned a $500B 'skinny stimulus' instead in September, which included zero money for state and local governments, a liability shield to protect corporations from workers that get sick from COVID, and a whole lot of nothing as far as direct payments to the people.

Mitch's bill failed, filibustered by the Democrats in the senate. Pelosi then passed a second, smaller bill after several months of negotiations, this one totaling $2.2T. The same result: Still sitting on Mitch's desk, collecting dust.

Now, keep in mind, while all of this was happening, the negotiations continued. Trump publicly called for larger stimulus checks, yes, but here's the rub: The president isn't a legislator. The Treasury Secretary, Stephen Mnuchin, who was negotiating with Pelosi, is also not a legislator. The only reason Pelosi was actually negotiating with him is because McConnell refused to come to the table - Mnuchin was literally the only avenue she had to get any kind of possible deal worked out with the GOP.

At some point, Trump/Mnuchin made a call for a $1.8T stimulus compromise. The compromise was never released to the public so there's no way to know what was in it, but it stil contained the liability shield. It also contained wording that made it possible for Trump to have total control over a very large percentage of the money it suggested for several programs. Both of which were obviously unacceptable to the Democrats. However, before Pelosi and House Democrats said a word, there were already rumblings from Senate GOP that they were not happy with the 'compromise', mostly because of the dollar amount and the 'blue state bailouts'.

McConnell panned the bill not long after, stating he'd be unable to get Senate GOP on board for a bill of that size. Two days later, he reintroduced his same $500B skinny stimulus bill for a vote, and again it was shot down. This was in mid-October.

Flash forward to after the election, and stimulus talks resume. The GOP is refusing to go over $1T at all, still, and Mitch reintroduced his 'skinny stimulus' for a THIRD vote, which, of course, failed again. At this point, Mnuchin had about $450B left from the CARES act that had not been used for the program it was intended for - that was reappropriated to the new stimulus deal. So, in reality, this $900B stimulus bill is still McConnell's 'skinny stimulus', but without the liability shield it originally contained and with the reappropriated money basically funding all of the UI/Stimulus checks. Democrats, at this point, had to cave on their demands for something larger and comprehensive - it'd been 8 months, and something was better than nothing. There was the kerfuffle about state and local initially, and eventually it and the liability shield got dropped entirely.

The bill passed the House and Senate, but was coupled with the omnibus spending bill for fiscal year 2021, as we have almost no time left to pass a spending bill for next year before shit hits the fan. Everyone seemed to be in agreement, though unhappy, and Democrats have been saying they want this to be a band-aid, with another Stimulus coming soon after Biden is inaugurated. It remains to be seen if that will be possible, especially with the fate of the senate still unknown.

And then along comes Trump. He popped up on Twitter at the eleventh hour to pan the stimulus bill, claiming it gave undocumented immigrants $1800 and was filled with foreign spending he found unacceptable, and stated that he wanted larger stimulus checks AND for the excess spending to be removed.

That 'and' is important, and what the GOP is focusing on over checks, because 'fiscal responsibility' during a pandemic, sure. Also, there's a few things I need to explain:

Undocumented immigrants do not receive ANY stimulus. Their family members with valid social security numbers, as they are legal US citizens, are able to receive the total $1800 - which is the initial $1200 stimulus check they were NOT eligible for earlier this year, plus the $600 stimulus check in this new bill.

Secondly, the 'foreign spending' and 'pork' is actually ENTIRELY in the FY2021 White House budget plan: I actually spent a couple of hours reading through the budget and collating each piece of contested spending [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stimuluscheck/comments/kj90ir/my_brain_hurts/) if you'd like proof. Trump, Mnuchin, Lindsey Graham, and several GOP members actually worked together to write this budget plan, which was released to the public in February 2020. Not only that, Trump would have been keyed in to every bit of spending in the current omnibus bill by his administration, as is necessary for any yearly spending bill.

And so we came to yesterday: Pelosi and the Democrats put the $2000 checks up as a standalone bill to be voted on by unanimous consent because the House was basically a skeleton crew yesterday, and the only way to possibly pass it was by UC. McCarthy rejected it. He then put the removal of foreign spending up for, again, UC, which was blocked by Pelosi.

Now the $2000 checks need to be deliberated and fully voted on once everyone is back in DC, because the UC vote failed. That will be done next Monday, I believe. It likely will pass the house and die on McConnell's desk.

Meanwhile, tens of millions of people lose their unemployment benefits on Saturday of this week, and Trump has the ability to 'pocket veto' the already-passed stimulus bill, which basically means there is absolutely no way for Congress to override him if he decides to just sit on the bill until January 3rd.

Now - do tax cuts lead to a better economy? The short answer: they *can* but it’s by no means a sure thing. I found an [ NPR article](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/30/452905475/fact-check-do-tax-cuts-grow-the-economy) fact-checking this assertion. It in turn references a 2012 study from University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business that found 35% of economists surveyed said that tax cuts definitely improve the economy, but 35% were uncertain whether they did or not. I also found a more lengthy/meaty article from [The Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/research/effects-of-income-tax-changes-on-economic-growth/) which states that “... it is by no means obvious, on an ex ante basis, that tax rate cuts will ultimately lead to a larger economy in the long run.”

So, yeah...no one knows for sure. 🙄",2021-01-01 20:46:29

>...removing hundreds of industrial mail sorting machines across the U.S., particularly in minority communities to sabotage mail-in voting...

This is the statement you need to defend, with evidence of why the USPS removed mail sorting machines.

-

> And Raffensperger, a Republican, isn't ""my guy"" just because he called out Trump for literally demanding to be just be given votes out of thin air and to just find them wherever. It's kind of telling though, that you refer to a Republican that displays a bare minimum of actual ethics in regards to this country's election process, as not being on your side.

He's ""your guy"" because you brought him up. No need for the added melodrama.

-

> That NPR article you cite, funny how you left out the rest of it. Specifically, the next two paragraphs.

I don't believe that Stacey Abrams' campaign manager's opinions on the bill are particularly relevant. It was an opportunity to expand polling locations that failed.

-

> The same NPR article then follows on by detailing Georgia's lengthy history of racial discrimination and voting discrimination targeted clearly at people of color.

It touches on it and provides some anecdotes. The typical sequence goes something like

> Statewide, the number of voters served by the average polling place rose 47%, from 2,046 voters in 2012 to 3,003 as of Oct. 9, according to the analysis. Some rural counties have as many as 22,000 voters assigned to a single polling place.

> Forsyth County, one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation, has grown its voter rolls by nearly 60% — or 60,000 voters — in the last eight years. Forsyth, a mostly white county about 45 minutes' drive north of Atlanta, now averages about 8,000 voters per polling place. Officials cut nine of its 25 polling places in 2013 and another after the 2016 election but added back five locations in 2019. No additional sites are expected to be opened for the November election.

Then eventually they'll include a quote by a community member or political science professor along the lines of ""When you look at the systemic issues that plague us as a society, oftentimes we're screaming but we're not being heard""

-

> The growth in registered voters has outstripped the number of available polling places in both predominantly white and Black neighborhoods. But the lines to vote have been longer in Black areas, because Black voters are more likely than whites to cast their ballots in person on Election Day and are more reluctant to vote by mail, according to U.S. census data and recent studies.

Why did Trump try to disenfranchise white voters by sabotaging the USPS? Or maybe all of the census data and studies took place between the mail sorting machines drama and the election? 🙄

The second part is where I actually disagree with you, as opposed to disagreeing with your arguments. I think the debate about abortion is a debate about where personhood begins. For children, the parents DO have an obligation to support it or give it up for adoption. Obviously there are exceptions such as protecting the mother's life, but I believe the overwhelming majority of abortions after the fetus attains ""personhood"" should be banned.

But as we highlight in the first section of this entry it is unfortunately not what we can expect for the coming decade. It is the fact that still almost every tenth person lives in extreme poverty and the slowing progress against extreme poverty that motivate this entry.” [link](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty)

You are keen on making George Floyd out to seem dangerous but... I wonder how dangerous an unarmed man can be while completely limp for three minutes? 🤔

I repeat because you choose to ignore it: The officer put his knee to Floyd’s neck (with the support of his pals!) for 7 minutes, 46 seconds. **Floyd was unresponsive for the last 2 minutes and 53 seconds.**

This was after all the “suspicion” bullshit you want to get stuck on to ignore the point. He made the decision to put his knee on the neck of an unarmed man for 8 minutes. 3 of which he was completely unresponsive for. 

Keep defending the officer, castanza1488. You hold the same implicit racial bias as the officer.",2020-08-05 21:39:51

l7hj5q,"Question:

Questions on GME. I think I understand the basics of a short squeeze and what is happening with GME. So hedge funds like Melvin Capital have shorted a lot of GME hoping that it would fall so they can gain profits. We bought a lot of the stock up before they actually closed the shorts. They have to buy the back shorts from it driving the costs up. I'm 💎✋🏻, but I just want to ask these questions to make sure I am not just wearing a conspiracy hat. So here they are:

1. I hear there is a difference in buying options vs the actual stock in regards to how it affects hedge funds? Can someone explain this?
2. How do we know Melvin Capital and others are actually shorting here and still are? There was news that people closed a lot of their shorts. I guess I am a little confused because if I buy shorts and I buy options, I don't think others can see what I am doing. So how are we doing the same for hedge funds? I am sorry for not doing my own DD on this, but being new to stocks in general, this is all a bit overwhelming.
3. I hear the hedge funds can just keep shorting and trading with each other? How true is this? Can you explain and if so, doesn't mean they can just do this infinitely?
4. Some people think the hedge funds are liquidating their other stocks and assets to cover their GME losses. How much water does this claim hold?
5. How many hedge funds are actually affected by this? Or is it just Melvin Capital and Citadel?
6. A lot of people hate Robinhood over their recent freeze of buys to retail investors and not hedge funds, I think specifically Citadel correct? Why just Robinhood? Webull also stopped trading for period of time until their Google rating dropped by like 1.
7. Again the thing about Robinhood. How much do some of us think we are wearing tin foil hats and Vlad is correct about his clearing house argument vs Robinhood being super shady and locking us out so Citadel and other hedge funds can gain an advantage?",2021-02-01 16:55:45

hthw8w,"#Appliances as Political Theatre

There's also a slightly broader element that pops up in Trump's rallies: at his heart, Trump is fundamentally a [populist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism). His political career comes from being seen as an everyman, not one of those 'insider political elites'. (Let's sidestep for a moment the fact that the man's living room looks like [the inside of a Fabergé egg](https://www.idesignarch.com/inside-donald-and-melania-trumps-manhattan-apartment-mansion/) and that he's built his *entire business career* on the notion that he provided a premium, luxury product for the wealthy; a look through his [Twitter archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive) for things like 'elite' makes it pretty clear that he's trying to distance himself from that label now.)

Lines like these play very well with Trump's base -- the three-in-ten or so Americans who will support Trump, ride-or-die, no matter what. You can hear it in the crowd when he [talks about dishwashers](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/gnJm-bWTh_k3FDHPjv0dmvr-DIFj62B3Z1reuTsVwVb8md4FIC2FrP1m5ni6CyuxopeZHNmfoQcdDPeKNbqtibVbzs8?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=3964.95). They're going wild for a *kitchen appliance*. The reason, as far as I can tell, is because this has become part of the [culture war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war#21st_century). Like the so-called 'War on Christmas' (which isn't), it stands for something deeper -- in this case, a conservative culture of limited regulation that the Trump Administration has repeatedly shown itself happy to play into.

(Consider that if Biden or Clinton pushed this same agenda, Trump supporters would not jump ship; it's not *about* the lightbulbs and the dishwashers, no matter how irritating it might be if you occasionally need to hand-wash a glass because it still has a spot or two on it. This is about *us* versus *them*. Changes that *we* make, no matter how small and regardless of their individual merit, are valuable because they're in opposition to what *they* want, and vice versa. Political opposition, especially in increasingly partisan times, is a good way of dividing camps and increasing party -- or personal -- loyalty. You can see this sort of thing on a larger scale when it comes to COVID-19 masks, where it's considered [among many to be a sign of loyalty to a group](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/23/doug-burgum-masks/) even if the science behind not wearing masks doesn't hold up. Even [Ivanka Trump](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8487597/Trump-supporters-slam-Ivanka-silly-stupid-wearing-face-mask-photo-op.html) was criticised by Trump's supporters for her decision to wear a mask, but Trump's [slowly increasing -- ish -- calls for mask use](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53453468) aren't turning his supporters off from him.)

So why this? Well, Trump has done his best to basically [systematically undo every piece of Obama-era legislation he can get his hands on](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/11/donald-trump-barack-obama-legacy), from the Affordable Care Act to the Iran Deal to LGBTQ rights and numerous environmental protections -- and this was one of the policies that Obama promised while he was still a candidate, before he even took office. (In fact, while it was passed by the Bush Administration -- in the [Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Independence_and_Security_Act_of_2007) -- [the candidate Obama made it a firm fixture of his platform.](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/492/phase-out-incandescent-light-bulbs/)) For Trump's ride-or-die base -- the [62% of his supporter who claim 'they can't think of anything he could do that would cause him to lose their support'](https://www.axios.com/monmouth-poll-trump-approval-a05b8144-1d1b-4296-a0d4-6ca0390b05ee.html) -- opposition to Obama and the Democrats is kind of a given. Dismantling policies that are linked with Obama is a grerat way to fire up the base, regardless of how much merit the policy may have had. (One of the most famous examples of this is [the disconnect between Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act](http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2013/09/26/FI10863c-release%209-25-13.pdf): a 2013 poll found that 46% of the group that was asked about 'Obamacare' was opposed to the law, while 37% of the group asked about the 'Affordable Care Act' was opposed to the law. They are, of course, the exact same law.)

Take, for example, [this tweet](https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1208573071625510912) -- from the official White House account, by the way -- from December 2019:

>If you like your lightbulbs, you can keep your lightbulbs! The Obama Admin tried to limit Americans to buying more-expensive LED bulbs for their homes—but thanks to President @realDonaldTrump, go ahead and decorate your house with whatever lights you want. 💡

It's a direct comparison between Trump and Obama, and it draws the line that this is bad not just on its own merits, but because it's an Obama policy. In the culture war, it's this kind of comparison that promotes in-group unity and strengthens the base, often for little political cost. It's not about winning over independent voters, but about proving that Trump is going to systematically dismantle everything the other team did -- no matter whether that's actually happening or even desirable.

#Drown It In The Bathtub

One of the major platforms of the GOP is that the government that governs best is the one that governs least: that the government should have a hands-off, *laissez-faire* approach to the running of the country and put their faith in the idea that the free market and personal freedoms will always lead to an optimal outcome. (Take [Grover Norquist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Norquist#Views_on_government), founder of anti-tax consortium Americans for Tax Reform, who said, 'I don't want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.')

This approach is... debatable, if you're feeling generous about it -- there are plenty of big-government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, that are very popular with Republicans as well as Democrats -- but it's still a general trend, and one that looms large in the modern GOP, especially post-Reagan. (Although not without exceptions; consider, for example, the fact that the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency) that oversees a lot of these decisions was founded in 1970 by Richard Nixon -- not exactly a liberal darling.)

So in that sense, rollback of more-restrictive government regulations are kind of what you get when you elect the GOP; it's a feature, not a bug. However, it's fair to say that Trump-era deregulations have been pretty intense, and a lot of them have focused on the environment. (You can see a regularly updated list of Trump-era deregulations [here](https://www.brookings.edu/interactives/tracking-deregulation-in-the-trump-era/). It's worth nothing that that site is maintained by the Brookings Institution, which is [generally considered to be fairly non-partisan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookings_Institution).)

Even on a personal level, Trump has *long* been opposed to environmental regulations and is a notable skeptic when it comes to... well, pretty much anything related to the environment. He's claimed that global warming is a Chinese hoax -- ['The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive'](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385) -- although he later walked that back (*...ish*) -- and said that while it was real it wasn't human caused, claiming ['Look, I think something’s happening, something’s changing, and it’ll change back again…'](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17977596/donald-trump-climate-change-hoax-60-minutes-interview). He pulled the US out of the [Paris Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement). He buried a climate change report from thirteen federal agencies because he ['didn't believe it'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46351940). Really, his history is [littered with statements of climate-change denial](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/08/politics/trump-global-warming/index.html), so take your pick.

In that sense, there's a case to be made that while the issues of lightbulbs and and dishwashers are small, they fit into a much larger pattern of anti-environment deregulation by the GOP as a whole. This is not new either; the GOP has [long been considered by some to be in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/27/climate-change-green-new-deal-republicans), denying established climate science in order to help boost the profits of industries that would otherwise be hampered by EPA legislation.

That's why this matters. It's easy to write it off as Trump not liking lightbulbs because they make him look orange or ranting and raving about [having to flush a toilet a whole bunch of times](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/dec/07/people-are-flushing-toilets-10-15-times-says-trump-in-call-for-water-regulation-changes-video) -- but it's emblematic of a much broader trend, and one that comes not just from the Trump White House but from the GOP as a whole.",2020-07-18 17:27:11

hthw8w,"Yeah, literally every single criticism in that speech is BS with modern high CRI LEDs.. except perhaps initial cost (though that is rapidly plunging, and if you consider lifespans, even expensive LED bulbs come out ahead)

- Even lower energy use than fluorescent bulbs.. check
- Even better color rendering and spectral continuity by using blue/UV emitters and harnessing multiple phosphors to generate a near perfect D50 and D65 Illuminant.. check
- ROSH compliant electronics and a non-hazardous disposal experience at end of life.. check

He does still look Orange, but the rest of us wouldn’t. 

Note: people are going to chime in about their experience with shitty LED bulbs over the last 10 years, but realize compared to other illumination technologies LED bulbs for general immunization is a technology space that really is progressing by leaps and bounds very quickly. There is a reason museums, photographers, videographers, film and television productions and stage lighting is all finally switching over, and it’s not just energy for efficiency.  It’s because modern illuminant quality, consistency, evenness of emission, flicker-free dimming (non-PWM), incredibly long lifespan (when they fail, it’s almost always the AC to DC converter, not the LED itself), and the precision of control has reached *second to none* status. 

Want to see some great modern lights, look up manufacturers like Yuji in Japan, and I’m sure a bajillion others internationally and domestically. 

(Though I admit the discount Walmart special LED bulbs manufactured using 20 year old technology, so as to not directly compete with halogens sold by the same companies, might still suck and produce “peaky” spectra 🤷‍♂️. But that’s hardly a technology or innovation problem)",2020-07-19 00:24:25

It's not safe in the mountains after dark. After dark is the predators time to shine. The screaming from the woods is some kind of wild cat or dog. So we stay away. Whistling attracts bears. Don't do that either.

And think about it, all of these threats are the biggest when you're little. And kids are stupid. If you tell them a bear comes when they whistle. They're gonna be out there whistling for bears.

If you tell 'em a woman screaming in the woods is actually a mountain lion, they're gonna go see the damn mountain lion. If you tell them to stay away from sounds you hear in the trees because that's where the things with teeth hang out in the day time. Well, y'all get it.

The Tennessee comparison story with the Tyson chicken factory, were those kids immigrants, J1 Students on work visas?

To assume or think Arkansas is about to allow big tech and corps to just snatch 14 and 15 year olds up and force them to work is asinine.

They have a free will to apply to the job.

Some of us had jobs since we were 14, because our parents couldn't afford to pay for a car, or college so we began working early and saving.

If we wanted steady income, we got a part time job until we could work full time.

The additional work was mowing grass and washing cars.

I could see the open border and the lack of effort to control it, being abused by not just the current admin and it's philanthropists buddies, but criminal organizations abducting kids. That'll happen regardless if it's legalized by age or not.

The problem is and question will be did the teenager apply or were they forced to go to the chicken factory.

Then actual white supremacy groups who don’t really understand satire or don’t care jumped on the “it’s okay to be white” as a not quite so hateful expression of their perceived oppression. Cause if you see someone doing a nazi salute that’s clearly fucked up and calls up memories of holocaust etc but the OK symbol is like a new gentler version of the whinny new Nazis message so instead of chanting “ The Jews will not replace us” they chant “ it’s OK to be white” 

I’m sure there are dozens of photos of me making the OK sign and theoretically someone could post those pics and call ME a racist 🙄 do you see the stupid troll game now?

South Dakota has fucked laws that’s why he’s getting away with this, it has nothing to do with him being white. He’s being charged with three different misdemeanors because South Dakotas vehicular homicide charge requires him to be under the influence and he wasn’t as far we know for sure, he was playing on his phone. This has been an issue in the past(the law not the attorney general running people over) if he was black it would be the same shit he’s attorney general not some random dude.

Also I don’t understand what you mean by the “white” thing to do. Are you implying he’s a shitty person because he’s white or that only white people can be shitty people? if this was an issue involving white supremacy it would apply 100% but in this context your just being vaguely racist against white people or assuming this is a race issue when it’s definitely not.

Growing up there was this one horse in the local stables that was like that. He lived for jumping. When he was in the arena his ears perked up, his whole demeanor changed. A bit like a dog scenting a rabbit? He just radiated energy, it was a joy to watch. And unfortunately not a common sight.

There are other horses who become quite dedicated to their work, like herding dogs or drug sniffing ones. These are the smart ones who enjoy having a purpose. They’re lovely and usually give their all when the rider makes the effort to bond/communicate clearly with them. They’re also usually seen as stubborn because they can refuse to do anything right if the rider is an ass or doesn’t know what they’re doing 😂

And there are the “teacher” horses who absolutely know what they should do and will do it even if the rider doesn’t really know what they’re doing. Lovely generous souls.

rho91b,"This is the main NFT white paper.  https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721  

White Papers can be technical.  So there's nothing wrong with watching some YouTube videos on EIP 721 to summarize.

You should know that this is open source software.  Meaning it's not a top secret rich people club.  There is a proactive community effort.  And anyone is free to take part and help out with their problem solving solutions.  *It is also a massive new job industry.*  And as this is new territory, the technology is rough on the edges.  Or not as robust as it could be at the moment.  Hence the comparisons to early 90s internet usage.  This will become more and more sophisticated with time.

+++

>it's a ""costly/hyped solution to a non existing problem"".

You're referring to the minting cost transaction on Ethereum.  That is a problem with the limitations of Ethereum that have little to do with NFT application.  The truth is that it is **NOT** costly to mint using *other* protocols.  It can [cost as little as a quarter to mint a utility NFT.](http://puu.sh/Ixotp/c8882e0817.png)  Part of the misinformation that the critics relay to each other.  ""NFTs are expensive to mint.""  They aren't.

As for a non-existing problem.  Considering the political climate... How can anyone proclaim someone has a ""non-existing"" problem?  People have differing pain points in their day to day.  People have varying professions/hobbies/idle time and interact with technologies in different ways.  Most people do not yet demand NFTs in their lives.  But that does not mean NFTs won't have a future value proposition.  We went from not using cellphones, to using smartphones.  Some people need more ram on their computers.  They purchase cars based on safety ratings, gas mileage, or pure vanity.  Vanity is one of the draws for NFTs...

+++

>For example how NFT would replace contracts and ownership documents, but people point out how these things are already way less costly and work just fine and are more secure.

So this is getting into the traditional channels; Or ""the middle man"".  I can't say I agree that ""this just works fine"" considering how demanding they are of our time and resources.  That includes the expense of money, mental and physical energy, and even luck.  This is a pain point we all share.  Having 100% alertness for clerical errors, having patience, having a high tolerance for bad news.  Filling out forms and documents.  Waiting to qualify for services based on our criteria and demographics.  Getting bounced around and dodged with robotic phone calls.  Getting into psychological battles with bureaucratic agents that just plain don't want to deal with you.  Follow ups and touching base with various organizations.  Or dealing with a mode of inept customer service.  Of course these aren't going to go away.  We can't at least TRY to do better than this?

The utility of NFTs proposes a way to automate much of this entire system.  For 25 cents...  You just future proofed your life for 25 cents.  Even if it has no standing or integrity as a legal document.  You don't need arbitration for everything that happens.  Let the exchange of digital assets settle this.  I don't know your situation.  That's your pain point!  If you really need to go through the official channels.  You can still do that!

And how secure is secure?  How forgetful are we already.  There is a data breach every other two-three weeks.  Here's a list of cyber security related crimes this year(2021).

[Robinhood Breach](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/robinhood-data-breach-exposed-7-million-customers/) // [Park Mobile Breach](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/parkmobile-breach-exposes-license-plate-data-mobile-numbers-of-21m-users/) // [Avast Password Breach](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/10/21/avast-hacked-again-as-spies-steal-its-passwords/) // [Twitch Data Breach](https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/twitch-data-breach-exposes-everything-source-code-confidential-company-information-and-user-payouts-hacker-promises-more-is-on-the-way/) // [Facebook Data Breach](https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4) // [LinkedIn Data Breach](https://fortune.com/2021/06/30/linkedin-data-theft-700-million-users-personal-information-cybersecurity/) // [Financial Service related data breaches in 2021.](https://www.upguard.com/blog/biggest-data-breaches-financial-services) 

These companies have to manage millions of individuals.  And protect them from exploits and glitches.  Also this is also going into cyber security.  Not my field.  And going way off tangent.

>excluding the current application on art business --- what do you think NFT can do on the long run, which cannot be done with traditional means?

Just quickly about art business.  As I mentioned earlier.  You're really not going to need to spend your money on a physical middleman or an arbitrator to settle some of these things.  The building blocks to protect individuals are being assembled.  I believe it because there are people who are dead serious about arranging this stuff.

* Insurance. (That's right. If the NFT metadata can be tracked. And we can prove losses.  You're holding your NFT badge?  Get a fat payday from the treasury.  Oh yeah, our guild will have a treasury.)

* Commissions/Deeds. (You can have multiple parties agree to whatever. You're all mature adults and professionals.  Handle all your negotiations and terms with NFTs and smart contract.)

* Publishing. (Easiest DiY.  You can fund your book/newspaper/journal/blog/magazine by selling them as NFTs.  Why the hell not?)

* Community upselling.  *One of my favorites.* (Everything you can do with Kickstarter and Patreon, can be handled by NFTs.  [FYI: Patreon is already front running this.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/patreon-confirms-its-exploring-crypto-as-a-way-for-creators-to-make-money/))

* Plagiarism defense ( [Yesterday I learned that DeviantArt has a partnership with OpenSea to combat art theft.](https://www.deviantart.com/team/journal/DeviantArt-Protect-Helping-Safeguard-Your-Art-884278903)  There are even [other NFT marketplaces providing tools and flagging NFTs for plagiarism.](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/dealing-with-plagiarism-18790)  The concerns of artists are not being ignored.  It is a community effort.  I've personally entered discords to warn artists about theft.  This is why I highly highly implore artists to get involved.  For as much as my peers scream about plagiarism.  They neglect to mention that their work is already stolen in second hands markets like eBay and Etsy.  It would behoove them to at least register accounts with these services.  Even if they don't upload or mint.  The fans of their respective communities will be able to distinguish who the real artists are. However if an artist did mint.  With the reverse image technology we have already. We can track the image metadata across all major social media channels.  Hell, there could be compensation.  But it really requires artists to be educated on this stuff.  Because in all truth.  NFTs are here to stay.  This stuff is revolutionary in bringing a mode of control that they haven't experienced.)

And the non-art stuff.  Not my area!  But still receipts! Jokes aside.  Receipts!  Receipts are full of important data about consumer habits.  Your entire shopping account can be condensed into an NFT.  And your NFT can even further be condensed into an NFT naming service.  Instead of that pesky 42 character count address.  Your address can be a more memorable (zombiehype.eth or 🧟@reddit) that is synced to ALL of your pesky long string addresses.  Licenses, streamers can't play music?  What if they can't play a game on stream? They can't do reaction videos.  Well then NFT license subscription!  Now they have more permissions to use music, movies, games as part of their content.  Real Estate and gaming is already here.  The model for skins and gacha systems are already modes of adoption.  Anyway  And that is why I would encourage everyone to get involved! This goes as deep as you like.  [But here's a list of ""Hey you could do this!"" possibilities with Smart NFTs.](https://phantasma.io/phantasma-smart-nfts/) The sky is the limit.  Do we need tokens and ledgers to accomplish NFTs?  Perhaps not.  But the reward structure is what incentivizes people to participate.  I'm gonna cut it off here.  I wrote this more for me.  Because I'm impassioned about this!

10moko9,"Except a lot of book fans (like myself) do complain, at least to some level. The story of the games is definitely not canon, but at least relies heavily on the books' world building. And the back stories of the characters are generally correct.

The show instead started off with a bit of a creative reading that some liked and some not... And then in season 2, it just went ahead and contradicted itself even, but deciding that the word and magic work differently now and made a pile of bull crap that stinks. The books aren't perfect (I don't think there's such a thing as a perfect book), but they had some great points to them and the world building is quite good and consistent. The games had the same backbone and were also generally consistent, so ofc the complaints are much less.

Also there seems to be a bigger overlap between the people who read fantasy novels in Eastern Europe in the 90s and the people watching the show vs people who play the games, + let's not forget the books came out in English only in the last decade or so 🤷🏼‍♀️",2023-01-28 02:49:06

I would absolutely LOVE to get rid of trumps twitter and I don’t agree with everything he has done or supported in office. I do find some redeeming qualities to his presidency though: he’s stuck to his campaign promise and donated his salary every year to a variety of causes, he supported the first step act for some prison reform and retroactive reduction of drug related sentences(a pretty decent step for a republican at least), included ability to unionize in trade deals with Mexico for the betterment of their people, addressed the over prescription of opioids, and prior to the pandemic lowered unemployment. 

I completely agree that the way the GOP is today isn’t conducive to less radical views either. It’s unfortunate that our options for this presidential election are what they are as well. I would prefer a more moderate candidate from either side as I think there’s much both sides could benefit from in the other, and preferably one with much less baggage.

Coupled with a massive ""Forget GameStop"" media campaign and screaming about every price decline; whilst staying silent on price rises. It is clear as day the media (owned by billionaires) are working on behalf of the very billionaires who are on the wrong (and fraudulent) side of this trade versus the average Joe who wishes to buy a stock or two and just holds it because they believe in the potential of a short squeeze and/or the new leadership's transformation programme.

They {Citadel} has the ""obligation"" as the direct market maker for GME to ensure Fair value for the shares being bought. So if they see a bunch of shares being purchased they can offset that direct buy pressure to things like OTC trading and dark pools that just swap Your IOUs to another person's IOU anytime a share is purchased or sold they can just say you will get a share at this price you bought at (😉) and has an X amount of days to deliver that share to you. But they have to continue to do illegal things to kick this actual delivery date of these IOUs to anyone. Anytime you see these insane jumps in price it is them actually ponying up. Just a matter of time before they run out of money or the people they owe money to say enough. To the moon not financial advice all of it. Love you.

nssi88,"I mean in theory it is great. A complete necessity for a healthy economy.

Companies need capital. They sell a portion of their business at a price for money now -- the business can grow now and will be worth more in the future. The stock owner makes money, the employees make more money (hypothetically) from being employed at a booming business, etc...wins for everyone.

Even shorts are necessary, to keep fraudulent gains in check. Otherwise stocks might go up and up and up...wayyyy beyond their natural values, which gives a false image of what is going on in our economy.

The problem comes in when you do fucking **stupid** ass shit like create a self-regulating body (DTCC) composed of the very market makers they are supposed to be regulating, who are *also* hedge funds (I'm looking at you, Citadel) who stand to make money on market manipulation.

Then you neuter the SEC and allow people who work in regulation to pursue careers in these companies (and vice-versa), don't require the disclosure of important shit (like short positions...also make the report date 45 days after the quarter ends...like...wat...), and in the miracle you *do* catch some shady behavior you slap a $25,000 fine on millions of profits and say ""don't do it again"". Spoiler: *they do*.

Meanwhile the average Joe has no idea because 1) nobody is taught this stuff in school, 2) the media is bought and paid for and just blasts you with terrorism or whatever hot button distraction they can manufacture, and 3) the politicians don't give a fuck because corporations are people and it hurts their bottom line to oppose them.

 Conservatively if that were to be paid to retail investors...because why tf not....for 30 million shares, i believe this is not true si% but just an example, that would equal out to about 428k per share.

Thats not counting everyone that pays on the way up, brokers, insurance ,market makers, and dtcc. That is not unreasonable to assume.

However, I agree that it was pretty clear trading was halted to protect market makers who over-exposed themselves with short positions. If we believe in a fair market, they should have been forced to incur those losses and fail, if necessary. Especially since they know the game better than some newbie who just downloaded Robinhood a month ago 😂

MBB is a kid. I was a shithead when I was 15 (and probably still am in some respects 😬) but I didn't have a giant spotlight on me. If she acts like people are accusing her of acting once she's in her 20s, then maybe I can get behind it.",2019-07-13 20:34:24

>You realize that The Conners was only that popular because it’s the spinoff of an award-winning sitcom that ran for a decade? 

You realize that The Conners pulled good ratings precisely one time, lost more than half it's audience in one week, steadily lost viewers the entire season and only missed cancellation because ABC wanted to spite Roseanbe Barr.  The point is any show can get big numbers for a single episode.

> (when it makes sense, as it did in the case of the spongebob “sweet victory” song). 

Except that it *didn't* make any sense to include a non sequitur tribute to a person completely unrelated to the NFL, Football, CBS, or Pepsi in the halftime show.  It certainly didn't warrant including having to pay licensing fees and royalties to broadcast a non sequitur tribute to a person completely unattached to the NFL, football, CBS, or Pepsi.

And 517 million live television viewers  plus live streams equal >1 billion views.

z15cft,"There is no proof that if you massage your own hand that it will feel good therefore it is pseudoscience. Listen to yourselves 😂😂.


Receiving chiropractic care is a subjective experience that can neither be proven or disproven since pain and relief are not observable to science. 

So all the claims that its pseudoscience...are not science. Lol. Top comment even links to something that says point blank that the benefits are comparable to massage. And massage is glorious. Thats all you need. 

To do science you have to be able to prove or disprove a hypothesis with observable effects that can be repeated. This simply can't apply here. You can't see pain. Maybe in the next millennium.

Do you want western doctors to prescribe opiates instead?  Because that is a very real alternative that really happens and in fact HARMS FAR MORE PEOPLE than chiropractic. Those doctors were trained by science and their solution is far far worse than chiro. 

Consider the possibility that you're parroting corporate shillery designed to drive profits rather than help people.

If it feels good then go with it. If it doesn't then don't.  But for gods sake please stop pretending that you're an armchair scientist regarding a matter that can neither be proven nor disproven by science. All you can do is ask: does it feel good or not.

z15cft,"No, I wouldn't make that comparison. But thanks for equating chiropractic with murder, lol 😆

What I'm saying is there are many starting points for young manual therapists whether from DC, PT, DO/OMP, AT, or other education streams. Each have a similar but different foundation and none is ""right"", which is to say regardless of profession there is some non-evidence based care taught. In fact, there are many conditions we simply don't have enough research on to approach purely based on high quality systematic reviews. Point is, it's up to individual clinicians to decide what kind of practitioner they will be. I think we should celebrate having clinicians of diverse educational backgrounds because it's actually better for patients: no single stream of education is 100% comprehensive, so we benefit from different approaches to cover the patients that don't fit in the typical boxes. 

Physiotherapy is often lauded on Reddit as the MSK Profession of Evidence but let me ask this. Is your PT someone who spends time with you, educates and reassures, and develops and coaches you through an individualized exercise program? Because that's ideal, but down the road PT #2 might be one to spend 5 minutes with a patient, throw on the IFC/TENS pads, and leave the exercise coaching to their assistant. It's not the profession that makes the clinician, not really. Physio #2 probably would have been a lousy chiropractor too. 

I'd like to reiterate the difference between chiropractic as a religion of pseudoscientific SMT worship, and a chiropractic degree as a useful starting point via a fairly broad and comprehensive four-year post-BSc. education which becomes more evidence-based each year. Painting every DC with the same brush is lazy. That said, I'm happy to concede that chiropractic's roots are in some weird shit and it's probably going to take a few more generations of evidence-focused grads to really leave that behind.",2022-11-22 12:47:29

z15cft,"Your astrology comparison is a fallacy. 

The central question is ""does chiropractic provide relief from pain or discomfort""

Now put your scientific thinking cap on and formulate a hypothesis then come up with a method of testing this that controls all variables. 

The sensation of pain is an inner body experience that is nearly impossible to prove or disprove. So it is also impossible to objectively prove or disprove if it has changed after chiropractic. 

So then it comes down to asking people if they feel better.  Strictly speaking this is not the scientific method. It is a subjective questionnaire.  With a large enough sample group you could have some certainty. 

I have first hand evidence that chiropractic provides relief.  Over and over and over again. And so do millions of people PER DAY that return over and over again. 

And you have a link to a study that claims it provides as much relief as a massage-  which are glorious by the way. Thats a lot of relief. So therefore it is evidence of EFFICACY!!!

As far as the certification goes- what authority is ""good enough"" to trust??  Btw they ARE certified 🤣🤣.

What really grinds my gears about this whole thread is the notion that you're somehow helping humanity or championing science. Its a subjective issue. Literally not even really provable or disprovable. Then everybody jumps into the echo chamber like gosh thanks for saving me from pseudoscience with these facts.  No, this is a disservice to humanity. Chiropractic does help people. And it is a fact that trained western doctors harm more people than chiropractors. Thats the science. 

I think theres a real chance that all the anti- chiropractic sentiment is just corporate shillery from the pharmaceutical industry that would like to sell you drugs for your pain.

This gets them some extra publicity for basically no cost. If they're very lucky, it'll also stir up the reactionary controversy train, which gets them even more publicity.

However, the thing to remember with this is that it's a completely cynical move designed to make more money, and isn't progressive so much as it is responding to popular trends. Hence why Disney will put a lesbian kiss in star wars (check it out, we love the Gays™), but will then edit out the lesbians in Asian markets. In one market it helps them, in the other it hinders, so they respond to the market forces.

o95lyf,"I’m not an English major so I can’t speak to the exact definition of “tone” and I’m honestly too tired to look it up after pulling an all-nighter, but maybe the better word would have been  “voice”? Not sure, but I’ll try to explain what I meant since I too get into communication trouble with my mother, lol. The way you write can indicate how some may interpret the writing, words that are used or not used can cause both our collective cultural consciousness and our own specific experiences to inform us on what the author is trying to convey. The way you wrote may sound too direct and, for some, not compassionate enough for how grave a tragedy this was. That lack of compassionate language might have rubbed people the wrong way regardless of intent. I know this can be hard to understand- I’m autistic so I have had a really hard time understanding this and have had to take precautions- but all I can say is maybe try seeing if you can put yourself into different perspectives and seeing if you might interpret your writing in ways you did not intend. Now there is no way to completely prevent misinterpretations of your writing, as everyone lives unique separate existences, but careful consideration before responding using the collective cultural conscious of English speakers or North Americans can help us prevent some larger misunderstanding. If my original comment came off to you as an attack then I assure you that was not my own intent, simply was trying to explain why you might have been experiencing some downvotes. I personally didn’t find offense to your comment, but I can see how some might see it as too cold even if this wasn’t the intent. Hope this clarifies what I was trying to originally say and if it helps, I don’t know what you might have intended by your last comment but it came off to me- and I can be completely wrong here- as defensive and that can in turn cause defensiveness from who you’re trying to converse with. I have a really hard time with all the ways one can miscommunicate or misunderstand a comment, so I feel for you if you feel that’s what happened here. Hope that helps! 😊",2021-06-28 11:30:55

So yeah I’m fucking retarted and thanks for pointing that out. My intentions were to make light of the puppy joke and definitely not about the genocide.  So to everyone I apologize and am pretty fucking embarrassed.  If it means anything at all about my character and not my humor, I recently had my nose broken during a little scrap I had with a trump supporter over the the kids in cages and how they can’t find the parents of around 600 of them for whatever that’s worth. 

But looking at my comment (I already said I fucked up so you don’t have to remind me) and reading it in the context of this post it is a great metaphor or reminder how genocides start.  People are dehumanized, look at the outsiders as animals or a lower class as the insiders, lack of compassion, empathy and humanity all tied up in a bow of fear mongering exactly like we’re witnessing in this country today. 

And as a defense of myself, if anyone downvoted me or thought I was an asshole or whatever (if u thought my sense of humor sucks than this may not apply to you), if anyone who did, or have those thoughts and use Facebook: Fuck You. My joke may have sucked but you are accomplices of the genocide this thread was about, the genocide in Myanmar, the genocide of the uighurs as well as the rise of illiberalism we’ve witnessed recently as well of a shitload more extremely unethical bullshit that Facebook covers up.  DELETE FACEBOOK. 

Again I apologize for the shitty attempt at humor. 
(I don’t really see the illiteracy though. Maybe you can point out what I fucked up. You learn from your mistakes and I already learned one so couldn’t hurt to learn 2) 

Also if you are concerned about suffering and privations of the “ out class”, these guys could use as much help as possible.

kodzoe,"Answer: You wanted to know who Mitch McConnell is? He is a politician. 

A political pawn of sorts. The appointed ""bad guy"" to point our finger at. To think he is alone in this decision would be ludicrous at best. Find me one American citizen that is okay with the current state of our country that isn't in the top 10% deemed ""the social elite"".

This is more than Republicans versus Democrats. This is OUR nation that WE THE PEOPLE formed not even 300 years ago to escape the very thing we are facing today: Deeply imbedded corruption within our government that brings about injustice, intolerance and infighting. If we continue to fight amongst ourselves they will always win. ""A house divided against itself can not stand.""- President Abraham Lincoln. They know this and are damn good at keeping their game in motion while we remain blind.

It's always THIS or THAT when it comes to things. The lesser of two evils. Sound familiar? They never tell you about the other option(s) hidden underneath the table. Why? To pit us against each other, give us a false sense of choice and to keep their chosen figures in power. Be like Geralt of Rivia, say fuck both of you. Next!

Our voice doesn't matter anymore. How can it when 6 corporations own 90% of ALL social media? Who do you think funds them? BAILS THEM OUT and not OUR PEOPLE? Granted them ""rights""? A business should not have the same rights as a human being. The business is property. A person can't legally be considered property without their informed consent. Veterans will understand this well. I should know, I am one. So, why treat a business as if it's a person that can make its own decisions? The people running the damn business make the decisions FFS!

Here's a link to an article about corporation's rights:
https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/are-corporations-people

Enough is enough. The lid is going to pop off. The truth is we vastly outnumber them. We ARE the backbone of the U.S.A. Without our servitude they will fall. Have you ever tried to do something without a spine? How about a few missing vertebrae? It is going to suck using your tongue to crawl towards the same goals you previously sprinted through, effortlessly.

A Lord/Lady without serfs is still a ruler though. Albeit, a ruler of dirt. They are pitiful, egocentric narcissists that adamantly remain hyper-focused on maintaining their social status within our caste system to benefit off of the serfs. They receive no benefit if we choose to stop serving them. Once they realize they have no power, their true colors will shine through and the empire of dirt will crumble. That's when WE THE PEOPLE will be called; extremist, terrorist, unpatriotic, etc. Once again, this is to purposefully divide us in yet another way. They're hypocrisy incarnate.

Someone's hero is another person's villain and vice versa. We need to unite as a People. Not a nation. Our nation has failed us. We've failed ourselves by letting it get this far. Why are some politicians seemingly above the law? If it were you and I we'd be in prison. A fancy one called Ft. Leavenworth at that. For? Treason.

When you break it down it's all because they refuse to truly take care of OUR PEOPLE. Why do you think they cared more about our economy than the People when the shutdowns happened? Why are they squabbling over chump change? $600 is 2/3 my monthly rent. That excludes all other expenses. That'll cover my medical bills at least. That's with insurance by the way.

I've read from other users living in other countries that they've been receiving checks every month since the shutdowns began. They work far less than we do AND make a decent living wage with just one job. Not two or three jobs. I've had roommates since I turned 18. I'm now 25 and still have one. Three people living in a one bedroom apartment just to ""catch up"" with society is ridiculous. If we were a ""third world"" country that might be the norm. 

I apologize for taking up a solid chunk of your time with this lengthy post. It needed to be said. I'm tired of it as I'm sure my fellow Americans are too. If we can't see the truth slapping us in the face perhaps our Allies can. Greetings from America!

bnbphu,"Sure there was some bias in the questions being asked. It is very hard not to ask a question with bias - often, the very nature of the question itself is biased due to the preconceptions and assumptions that it entails. It’s true, there was overt bias in the questions.

But the bias was not necessarily excessive (there were by no means “gotcha” questions at all), and underneath it lied a somewhat reasonable question to say the least. Ben could have easily acknowledged the bias, but still answered the question, and answered sufficiently well to make the bias apparent and effectively counter the claims made. Just by clearly explaining his point of view.

Instead he attacked the credibility of the interviewer/network and avoided many of the questions. Accusing the interviewer on a more directly personal level. Deflecting scrutiny and getting into petty squabbles with the interviewer. When he could have more effectively “shown” the audience the lack of credibility of the interviewer by explaining his perspectives, instead Ben just kept “telling” us that the interviewer was bad, basically. He could have “won” just by detailing his views to show the audience that they make sense and are superior to the views of the interviewer.

(Which, by the way, they’re not, and he’d never be able to do any of that. Ben’s a massive douche whose beliefs are grounded in self-serving righteousness, anti-secular sentiments, contempt of others, and a ton of religious bullshit that has no place in our legislation 👍)",2019-05-12 07:05:25

Here, the city wants to choose the restaurants that allow the most access to the business for the most people. Chick-Fil-A is closed on Sundays and also anti-LGBT, which discourages people from going there in multiple ways. There is no perfect business, but it’s reasonable to say the city wants a business that will use its profits / success to treat others more fairly. You could put in Chipotle or something and Christians can still go there and Chipotle probably isn't donating to restrict Christian marriage rights. The city is not obligated to give a spot to Chic-Fil-A just because they exclude people for ""religious"" reasons. In the past, religion was also cited as an excuse for slavery, discrimination, Jim Crow, and other stuff. And honestly, it’s not like Christians can only eat at Chic-Fil-A.

They start as outcasts from society at an early age and when they hit puberty they turn into what you’ve seen are called “tankies”. They embrace being a loser who will never function in modern society instead of standing up to bullies and trying to join said society. You can look at /r/MoreTankieChapo if you want a peek inside of how these things operate. I say “things” because I have a hard time believing they are actually human beings (and most of them reject pronouns even if they don’t identify as trans, they don’t like being referred to as humans in some cases because of their total rejection of society), be warned these things are fucking weird and you’re going to lose a lot of faith in humanity if you actually spend any time learning about what they are and how they behave.

Again, they’re actually mentally ill and they need help, but they get together on the internet with other challenged people and that reinforces and normalizes their mental illness. It’s really sad tbh and Reddit shouldn’t allow a community like that to exist but here we are.

Of course the public is dying to get out, people have been killing themselves in droves since covid started because it’s not natural for people to stay cooped up in their houses for years on end without human interaction. 

Also if your employees have been getting sick by the dozens and all have life destroying side affects left behind by the virus, and you’re still choosing to stay open, you have no one to blame but yourself sweetie. 

>But I have to make money and so do my employees

exactly. So you need the public to come out and shop at your store. Keeping the whole Florida economy closed for years on end is not the solution and Desantis did the right thing opening up.

Finally I didn’t say it “hasn’t been that bad for me” I said “it hasn’t been that bad.” Hospitals were flooded at the beginning and that was bad, the lockdown at that point was justified. But since then hospitals have been nowhere near max capacity in Jax and lasting side affects have been really rare.

126h6zs,"Answer: this was theater on DeSantis’ part, responded to with delicious, petty comeuppance by Disney

While u/splotchypeony gives a very good explanation of current events here

https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/126h6zs/whats_the_deal_with_disney_locking_out_desantis/je95n4m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3

tldr: Desantis installed a far right committee to check and control Disney. Once it was clear the current board was to be displaced, they agreed on new stipulations that renders it powerless, which the committee—no matter who is in it—is bound to.😆
______
it’s important to recognize the background. DeSantis accomplished many things by metaphorically screaming into a megaphone about his response to Disney.

1.	⁠His supporters see headlines that he is cancelling ‘woke’ culture, cancelling LGBTQ community and supporters, and fighting for ‘traditional’ rights.
2.	⁠This is a *message* to any of his FL opposition: stay quiet and stay down. He will go far beyond his mandate and powers to come down harshly on anyone who goes against him, because if Disney is not safe, is anyone? Recall he swatted and intimidated a covid researcher who was sharing the full publicly available statistics, while he was deliberately suppressing COVID death toll to bolster optics. Attacking Collegeboard for their Black history subjects. Arbitrarily removing and censoring school books and libraries. Forcing anyone blogging or reporting on his govt’s actions to ‘register’. Etc ad infinitum

Know that his actions against Disney were a platitude. Their situation does not meaningfully change whatsoever. Any action he took was expected to be quietly overridden in court months later anyway. But he gets attention. Most people will hear ‘Disney got put in its place’, not that he’s wasting FL funds and stretching his powers into literal-fascism for headlines for his future presidential run—something to very much fear, seeing his current actions.",2023-03-30 15:14:37

bx68t1,">Since then, the company has made a very concerted effort to be seen as a luxury brand, producing very expensive products

The technical term for this, if anyone is curious, is [Veblen good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good).

That said, I think it's worth mentioning the market pivot is not simply a change in strategy, but something driven by necessity. The iPhone has effectively begun to plateau as later iterations due to a combination of the limits of technology (size decreases and battery increases are marginally smaller), and the fact all the most useful innovations have already been applied (leaving only increasingly more niche things left. And the more niche a feature, the worse its cost-to-value ratio to the average consumer, so they're increasingly hesitant to add them.) On top of those two things there's the market over-saturation; there are too many perfectly functional older iPhones in circulation, which cuts deeply into sales of newer generations. They've basically painted themselves into a corner through their own success.

So the question is, what to do about it? 

1) One option is to pivot to **rebrand themselves** as a Veblen good. But this is of limited success, since the minimalist body makes it hard for conspicuous consumers to show off whether they're using a newer or older iPhone at any reasonable distance. (Especially since the size difference between generations can be measured in millimeters). That, along with the market oversaturation with iPhones makes it hard for people to associate them with exclusivity. 

2) The second option is to **change the iPhone from a good to a service**. Hence their [iPhone upgrade program](https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program). They already have success with this through software like iTunes and cloud stuff, so they're attempting to do the same with hardware. Profit margins of replacing phones yearly must be complete shit, so I imagine they're hoping to break even through periphery software; by constantly providing new phones, they'll funnel users online spending through Apple™ services, hopefully increasing revenue from them, and making it harder for users to try and switch over to anything Android since everything is in Apple's servers/software.

3) The last option is to **replace the smartphone entirely**. This is by far the most lucrative option since it will have no competition with older versions, unlike any future version of the iPhone. Given this fact, and that Apple has bought out a number of companies related to the augmented reality field, it's almost guaranteed Apple will release some sort of AR glasses eventually. They have to release **something** disruptive to prevent continued self-cannibalization of the iPhone market, and the only other feasible choice for a portable platform (Apple watch) is hamstrung by the lack of usable interface. Which leaves AR glasses looking like the best option to go with after the iPhone.",2019-06-05 19:47:42

While they have certainly made some design missteps as of late, if I’m not mistaken they have lead in industrial design for the past decade and been copied repeatedly by other major manufacturers. Their laptops, like their phones, hold their value better for resale, and are well supported within their service lock-ins. If you don’t intend to keep your laptop forever, it’s not a bad choice to recoup your money when your done with it. 

A lot of professions like graphic design, publishing, and layout artists are based around Macs as well. Makes sense if that’s a career you want to stick with those products. 

Moreover, what’s wrong with someone owning something expensive? Why do you care if Joe is using a MacBook and you are using an HP? As long as you are both happy wtf does it matter what someone else paid for their laptop?

We don’t need to sit here and obsess about theories we have no evidence for based on vague correlations that you could make about anything and everything. Literally anything is possible. But if we believe every possibility you’re going to be wrong 99% of the time. You’re doing it with this because it confirms what you want to believe and helps you vilify who want to vilify to confirm your biases. We have to have a little thing called evidence before we go around accusing people of things we want to believe. I’m sorry this is a difficult concept for you to grasp.

He was giggling by himself a lot, and at one point, he even hides under the desk and kind of starts geeking out. Its on the video, and I know I may be speculating too far, but as an ex-addict, I could feel it in the air. Right before he was supposed to start, with the cameras rolling, he suddenly left, for like two or three minutes while we all just silently waited for him.

He seemed to have gone without notice, but came back and just seemed super out of it. Played a hell of a show though. Idk. I get sad thinking about it.

I don't know buddy. Maybe you're just specifically clicking on the few topics that are political and then looking into comment threads until you find something you disagree with and then making blanket generalizations about entire groups of people.

What's going on right now is still bad. It was bad 6 months ago under Trump and it's bad today. But didn't Trump literally sign an order with the ICE union prohibiting executive orders about ICE without union approval? And isn't Biden working on getting that undone so he can actually do something about the situation? If in a year, nothing has changed, then absolutely I will consider it Bidens fault too. But he's been President for only two months, and despite what whichever side isn't in power at the time will try to have you believe, the President doesn't actually have that much power in most situations.

I'm definitely in one of the luckiest areas, just waking up to a fucktonne of smoke most mornings and hack shit up in the mornings. PM was only discovered to be in Hawaii when our Greens Party tried to contact his office and was directed to deputy PM's office. Our current party in power is your typical far right wing party we're seeing more of all over the world. Overly religious, science denying and corrupt. To name a few things:

• While PM was away MP Peter Dutton (crazy fuck) awarded the PM's church with $120,000

• Trying to bring in new ""Religious Rights"" bill or something that allows members of your community to discriminate against you (e.g call you a heathen, tell you to burn in hell, say you deserve your disability cos of Jesus, etc)

• Trying to ban peaceful protest

• Arresting/raiding journalists

• Increasing police powers and lowering liability to an unsettling degree with no just cause

exe1iz,"2022 called..they now want your analysis on Ezra Miller, who has been accused of similar actions and strangely has NOT been fired by Warner Brothers…I wonder why that IS🤔 It’s something how JK Rowling speaks out for biological women (while also stating trans women need to be protected & understood as well) and she’s attacked & labeled a terf. Ezra Miller physically attacks and badly injures not one but two women and guess what, Miller is still walking free, still going to perform a role in a major film franchise. And yet…where’s the outrage over that? Where are you not calling for Miller’s dismissal? Why does Miller get a free pass here? Because Miller has gotten one. WB fired Johnny over a verbal accusation with no physical evidence, so did Disney, but Miller still has a job, despite voluminous evidence of guilt. It’s almost as if because Miller identifies as a member of a certain group, he is not held to the same standard you hold for Johnny Depp or JK Rowling. 

My doctor is a trans woman & she’s great & I adore her…all I’m asking? 
MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. If you ever wonder why people do not take movements or some of these insults seriously it’s because of things like the attack on JK Rowling for stating basic biology. Or the automatic belief of Johnny Depp’s guilt just because the accusation was made, no trial needed, the finger was pointed and his life as he knew should, over. The same people saying “MeToo” dog-piled Johnny Depp on the basis of an accusation. No evidence, no police report or arrest, no court case, just words. When called out on they started yelling “Believe women!” while simultaneously brushing the women that Ezra Miller physically attacked under the carpet. Their experience did not fit the narrative of the current day, as such, it mattered less. And “Believe women”? This rallying cry assumes that all women are honest and would never lie, everyone knows this is not the case.

JK Rowling is not a bad person for stating biological facts. And yet they came for her & labeled her a TERF. Think about this for a minute…they consider one “trans-exclusionary” for the most bizarre reasons. I have seen the twitter mob attack more than a few lesbians because they didn’t want to date trans women. That made them “sexist, wrong, & exclusionary”. Got them labeled as TERFS, bc they will not alter their preferences to include trans women. The reason being, their lesbians for a reason, they like women. Not the idea of women, but the physicality of women. It’s very interesting to me how you see decades old protests of LGBT people marching saying “we’re here, we’re q u ee r, get used to it”, back then the push was for people to be less judgmental about their sexual preferences. Live and let live…but now, that script appears to have been tossed. With the increase of visibility of trans women in our society it’s being rewritten in such a way as to now shame lesbians into changing the sexual preferences they fought to not be judged over in the first place, for them to be altered to accommodate a group of people, transitioning or not, who still have physical attributes lesbians are not attracted to. If they don’t comply, they’re attacked and called TERFS. Some are physically threatened over this. 

How is it okay with anyone to shame a person over their sexual preferences or to seemingly try to force someone to alter those preferences to include someone they are not attracted TO? 

A person is not a bigot over this. Also, you will always be disappointed if you judge past events, actions, literature…by the standards of the current day. Those sands are so forever shifting that what is the standard one day could be completely different the next. JK Rowling is an amazing talent who has accomplished more in her life than most of you complaining about her ever will. Her statements in support of biological women do not diminish her in the least & as for her books being “unreadable”, well, that’s your opinion but not the majority one.

And in case you were wondering…I’M FEMALE & no, I’m not suffering from “internalized misogyny”, I’m suffering from an inability to support BS. Feminists say they want equality but then exhibit behaviors I have previously described. They don’t want equality, they want to be an elevated class over men. Many decades ago women didn’t work, they couldn’t vote, they stayed home…then the pendulum started to swing, women got the vote, we had more rights, we worked outside the home…so the pendulum swung from few rights to many & instead of settling in the middle, what true equality should be, (we will never be totally equal, it’s an unpleasant truth but we won’t be…why? Bc men and women are different and have different strengths, it’s shouldn’t be controversial to state this) feminists grabbed hold of the pendulum and didn’t let go. 

As a result, we have boys growing up that are held to a female standard of behavior in the classroom and are labeled ADHD/ADD if they won’t sit still. We have boys (& men) who are treated with little to no compassion while being blamed for every ill of our world. Boys are being beaten into the ground, girls elevated to an extent that it proves my original point, feminists don’t want equality, they want to be elevated above men. Which is why you now see women fighting against this, it’s going to be up to us to knock the pendulum out of the feminist grip. When you have people stating, arguing that should be a woman’s choice to be able to a b o r t her baby up to the 9 month mark simply because she decides she wants to? 

We as a society have FAILED. I won’t get into the abortion debate, except to state I am pro choice within a reasonable time frame and abortion up to 9 months, ain’t it. Roe v Wade wasn’t toppled by conservatives, pro choice advocates did it, it’s on people like you. The constant push for no limitations did it. People can stomach abortion at 20 weeks it’s the push for whenever she feels like it that they cannot. 

It’s been a while since the OP…I still felt this warranted a reply. I doubt you’d like it or even see it. It may get deleted by a mod, still, I feel better just putting it out into the world. As in “hello world, THIS is what I think…” and I’m not alone in these thoughts, there are many who feel just like I do but are afraid to say it out loud. We exist. We could be one of your friends who silently disagrees with everything you say, then later in private tries to rationalize that you’re really a good person deep down. The question is, ARE YOU? Who really knows the answer to that…

avqyxn,"Many vegans hate PETA as well.  Before someone asks why I said the dreaded word (and before the “see? Vegans have to announce themselves” joke), It’s because veganism goes directly in line with what PETA claims to stand for. However, euthanasia for the “greater good” is bullshit.  Also, the whole naked women and men on the anti-fur campaigns they put out could be done in a non objective way. Fucking problematic organization if I ever saw one. 

My whole bottom line: vegans may seem crazy for what we do in the public eye, and you can go ahead and keep calling us that or thinking it’s true, but at the very least PETA is not indicative of what the goals of veganism are. Remember, there are “animal abolitionists” who belong to PETA, yet eat animals.    

Also, I get that no one asked, but if one person has a better understanding of vegans then I’ve done my job I guess. #Vegangelism™️",2019-02-28 15:37:09

avqyxn,">their actual stance is that animals are better dead than anything but wild

But is that actually their stance? What PETA and their founders have said is they'd rather live in a world where there's no such thing as pet ownership. They think breeding animals to be pets is bad, especially as there's so many abandoned animals waiting for adoption.

They also celebrate well loved and cared for companion animals. One of PETA's founders has said:

>I love walking someone else’s dog. I don’t have the luxury of having a dog myself because I travel too much, but I love walking and cuddling somebody else’s dog. I just came back from the shelter today and they let me walk three dogs at lunchtime. It was great.

\- [Interview with Ingrid Newkirk in Satya magazine](http://www.satyamag.com/jan01/newkirk.html), January 2001

If they genuinely believe pet animals are better off dead, why is she running around playing with her friend's pets instead of euthanising them, or at least breaking off contact with these friends? Why does PETA [offer animals up for adoption](https://www.peta.org/category/miscellaneous-parent/adoptable/) as pets? It's almost as if they don't actually believe that pets are better off dead.

It's almost as if there's a campaign to discredit animal rights activists being paid for by animal industry lobbying groups such as the ""Center for Consumer Freedom"". They made the website [petakillsanimals.com](https://petakills.com) and push out press releases which spark most of the anti-PETA talking points you see in threads like these.

Pesticides are not the cause of condor decline, it's actually lead buckshot in the food they scavenge, which causes them to be perpetually lead poisoned. And they are not really ""brought back"" from extinction. Their population numbers are much better, **but** that is only because they are a heavily managed population. On average, every wild member of the condor species is caught and treated for some form of lead poisoning at least once a year. Without intervention, the entire population would die within a few years at most. I know this because a very good friend of mine works on condor management with the San Diego zoo and UC Santa Cruz.

Somehow that will end up being ""...because the damn commie liberals are corrupt!"", not because of anything like the uber-conservatives wanting to live in The Handmaid's Tale. Oh, no.

Ok then.

I know Snyder's work very well.  He is a fourteen-year-old boy in a 50-year-olds body and he has convinced himself and a small but vocal cadre of like-minded manchildren that he is a visionary auteur.  

The fact that a bunch of internet fanboys managed to convince a major movie studio to let his ego run rampant on a four hour long new cut of a mediocre superhero movie that already suffered from an excess of Zack Snyder as it is, in the name of his 'artistic vision', is easily one of the most amusing episodes of what has, let's face it, been a pretty crappy year.",2021-02-15 17:16:44

Irrelevant, It **can** happen which is why people are standing with NN. But the fact remains that there's strong incentive to turn the internet into cable. And you can't prove otherwise. So the NN movement isn't fear mongering.


>First of all, I said it was majorly impactful for 2 decades, which would put the date around 2000. Not the 90s. While it was affecting things in the 90s quite a bit, it wasn't until 2000 hit that it became massively important to culture and the economy.

>But ok, so you are quite young then. Just because you weren't on the internet much pre-2010, doesn't mean literally hundreds of millions, or even billions, weren't. Pre-2010 internet culture was still quite big; it absolutely shaped the youth, pop culture, and economics of the world. While streaming was not a particularly popular thing in the very early years, it absolutely existed as soon as it could, and it's a bit ridiculous to say streaming is a measure of the impact of the internet. Skype came out in 2003, for example, while Youtube was around in 2005, Dailymotion as well. Justin.tv, the predecessor to Twitch, came out in early 2007. Sites like Slashdot (97), SomethingAwful (99), 4chan (03), Digg (04) impacted internet culture which spread to the outside world. Napster in the early 2000s was a massive shakeup to the music industry, just as general filesharing was to just about everything. Internet porn existed almost day 1 with video playback. Online gaming was a thing forever, the first Counter Strike came out in 1999, while you had things like Unreal Tournament that were huge as well, and then the original Xbox popularizing it further. Teleconferencing, stock portfolio sites, e-commerce, and other web technologies massively impacted business. Phones with internet technologies like web browsing, email, live services (weather, stocks, news), video chat, gaming, etc., such as later Palm phones, Nokia phones, Windows Mobile, etc. gave all of these internet technologies portability, many years before iPhones. Boomers not knowing what ""meme"" was in the 90s (when it didn't exist) doesn't change the fact that the internet has been a massive boon to culture and economics for decades. Hell, Snakes on a Plane was a 2006 movie that became a HUGE phenomenon on the internet before its release. Of course the internet is bigger and more ingrained now, but even in the early and mid 2000s, it was absolutely huge and already had major impacts on just about every industry.

>In fact, the fact that you use the term ""boomers"", talk about how they didn't know about ""memes"" in the 90s, and talk about how Apple hadn't put that tech in everyone's pockets yet pretty much outs you as either quite young, ignorant about what you're talking about, or both.


Wow you are the king of missing the point. None of this mindless rambling disproves what I'm saying. You're just listing off random shit that exists and the year it was made. None of the irrelevant bullshit  combined requires even a fraction of the bandwidth used by Netflix or youtube in 2010. Do you just not understand technology? Is that it? Every single thing you listed is a thing that was either nich or exclusively used by young to middle aged people. These days it's not even considered unusual for an elderly person to get their news from a smartphone. 

Not sure how else to articulate this to you because you're objectively wrong.

A lot of things *can* happen. That isn't an argument. And you say there's an incentive to do so, but so what? There's ""incentive"" to do lots of things, that doesn't mean they're happening. The actual fact is that you can't point to anything that shows ANY ISP was even CONSIDERING having that model. It runs completely counter to how the internet has been sold since its inception. It's a complete fabrication. You don't just get to fabricate something and claim that, because the fabrication is *possible*, it's likely in any way or deserves policy based on that remote possibility.

Not sure how else to articulate this to you because you're objectively wrong. 

Your stipulation was not adoption rate, or rate of internet use, but of impact on culture and the economy. I've shown numerous examples of the huge impact the internet had on culture and technology as far back as 20 years ago. Just because you're ignorant about that period doesn't mean it didn't exist. 

>Maybe take another gander at my comment. Apple put the internet in everyone's pockets around 2010 when they made smartphones more ubiquitous than indoor plumbing. Even fucking homeless people have them and can stream with free WIFI. Lol you gonna start rambling on and on about how smartphones were everywhere in the early 2000s 🤣?

The iphone came out in 2007 and phones had the **internet** years before that. Again, you were talking about culture and **the economy**, and phones like Blackberries were huge pre-2007 in businesses, letting people use **the internet** on the go, impacting **the economy**.

What you're regurgitating right here, is the exact same propaganda that the Russians were posting prior to the Ukraine invasion.

Fortunately the pandemic seems to be winding down, after killing **millions** of people, and now that like 70-90% of people are vaccinated, in most places.

(And the most recent variant is very contagious, but less deadly-- something many viruses mutate toward, since it gives them the greatest chances of survival.)

That doesn't mean ""we were lied to,"" that just means we got lucky, and the efforts of billions of responsible people paid off.

But congrats on not only drinking the Russian Kool Aid, but actually spreading it around so your fellow countrymen can have a sip as well. I'm sure Vladimir really appreciates the assist.

Rest assured, though, Gaetz is on borrowed time right now. That investigation is underway, his pal flipped on him, and right now investigators are getting all their ducks in a row before they move to arrest him, because he’s such a high profile politician.

Women in education, jobs, etc. are not allowed in anymore, they're being replaced by men. They are also not allowed to go out without a male companion. They are supposed to wear a full burqa which doesn't even show their face. Many families that tried to oppose were killed. They are trying to flee as far and soon as they can.

nijo3q,"Extrapolating from the data I looked at last I worked on this issue a couple years ago, there are some especially concerning aspects of the pandemic. Being stuck at home with your family would definitely exacerbate issues related to spousal abuse and child abuse. Back then 37% of homeless folks in LA were victims of domestic violence, 40% of homeless youth in the country were LGBT. Abuse relating to those things was highly visible online this year and I’m sure that will read out in future data as some folks were forced from their homes due to feeling unsafe or being unwelcome. Participating in various support groups as an LGBT abuse survivor has been harrowing, the situations many of these people experience are unenviable and I hope LA is considering how to help those people (both the unsheltered and those with an unstable home environment due to abuse). 


And 10/10, excellent summary. You hit damn near every beat that I could ask for in an intro-level summary of the situation (very well sourced too). As someone who was involved in the data side of LA’s homelessness crisis, thank you. 


PS, I wonder if I crosspost this to the LA subreddit if they’ll just ban me flat out. They’ve so far been outright hostile to any data or insight shared, preferring to say disgusting things about the victims of homelessness instead ☹️",2021-05-23 09:43:32

nijo3q,"As someone who worked on homelessness from City Hall, there are many options. Too many to list them all, but here’s a sampling from my experience:


Want to provide immediate aide? Social work and emergency services are the frontline. You’ll be busy and looking at the problem up close. You often are creating information in the form of data that is aggregated from your service. 


Want to think big picture and (shout at lawmakers to) change the rules of the system as a whole? Join the Data Science Gang, we figure out wtf is going on, where acute/chronic issues exist or will exist. It’s also a very versatile role, as you can often shift into different departments/categories as they all need to be connected to the data pipeline in some way. It’s also endlessly fascinating to learn about each field/area (but I’m a little biased here 😉).


Want to get the people in line to make the stuff your data/policy analysts are always begging you for to happen? Political science and activists bring the people to the table and make any ideal plan into some level of reality (which damn can that be harder than you’d think). Note: RESULTS MAY VERY, it definitely requires thick skin as far as managing expectations and being persistent, but it’s obviously pretty key to any future improvements. 


Are you a workhorse and just want to go to town, immovable object vs unstoppable force style? Help those poor guys in sanitation. It’s such a fascinating ecosystem of intertwining systems. Many of these guys are also on the frontline, but instead of giving someone a meal or medical attention it’s their job to get rid of hazardous materials... and people generally don’t like when you throw away their shit, even when we’re talking literal shit. It’s a facet of the challenge that is not glamorous but is critical to ALL of our wellbeing.


In LA we actually have an on-call team who are tasked with providing a whole litany of services any time certain city employees, social workers, advocates, etc encounter a homeless individual. They hail from all the departments the city has mobilized for homelessness (soo many) from social work to health to housing to policing.  They sit in a room that has each role filled 24/7 to make sure they always have someone from each department as a resource. I’m certain they are overwhelmed, but they’re working towards better agility in addressing the immediate challenges. 


Disclaimer that it’s been a minute since I was in the room for these updates, so I am a couple years out of the loop, but it seems the major initiatives (A Bridge Home) are still slowly rolling forward. If you want to help people as a job and are down to work for local government or with them in a nonprofit or organizational role, I’m sure you will find work that needs to be done. Addressing homelessness is like exploring a microcosm of the human experience. It’s a situation that has so many layers, so many experts (from research and from lived experience), and just so much to do that I could never describe it as boring or easy. It can make you feel defeated, especially depending on which part of the struggle you are addressing. Plus everyone around you (locally) will bitch to you about petty-ass “waaah there is a tent on my street” stuff as if you should just go move every individual person “somewhere else.” It is absolutely worth it and if my disability didn’t absolutely wreck me you better believe I’d be there working for a reprieve from this brutal and uncaring capitalist hellscape. You’ll see plenty of ugly behavior and NIMBYism, but man will you meet some of the most dedicated, caring, and enduring people.


ETA: there were tons of people with various degrees in humanities, polysci, social work, etc around naturally, but there were also people who got their start just by being part of the activist community/leadership and worked their way all the way into the mayor’s office. Many got degrees somewhere along the path, but there is plenty of room for people who are pillars of their community and are just hustling for their cause. It’s damn impressive. I can’t give very useful advice on that path since I was lucky enough to get a grant for school and that’s how I first approached the subject, but I want to be clear that there are ways to help without a degree too.",2021-05-23 09:11:40

10uakkk,"Answer: Its wonderful compared to most kids shows IMO. A lot of kids shows seem to be just written for kids, which can be kind of painful to watch as an adult. But Bluey, as a parent, I just love the characters because they have a lot of depth of who they used to be before they had kids. A lot of parents in children’s shows are just portrayed solely as caretakers. On Bluey however, the mom still plays field hockey sometimes, and they show dad getting out a box of things “from when he used to be cool“. 

I absolutely love the way the parents interact with the children and it has given me a lot of ideas on how to handle my own. They have wonderful imaginations and really get down to their levels to dispel tantrums. They make it fun in a way that seems attainable, not just like perfect Family life sometimes shown to us through shows/social media where we never see the behind the scenes on how that happens.

There’s been some tearjerkers also, like the episode where they visit Chili’s (blueys mom) father, it’s called “Visiting Grandad”. It was so beautiful and sweetly written and completely snuck up on me. 

And omggggg, The episode “the pool” where they are going to the pool and the mom is trying to get everybody to pack all their things, but dad takes them and says they don’t need this or that, and then they end up needing all those things, I was absolutely rolling 😅😅 

The people that write the show very obviously have children and are married because they navigate little things like that so elegantly. In a way that is funny but so true.

So you pair the clever writing, dynamic characters, absolutely beautiful scenery, and the ability for both child and parent to learn - its no surprise to me why it is such a hit!

It also has a lot of real nuance that kids see in their lives and helps them to understand how they might want to react to similar situations in their own lives. A lot of other kids shows don’t really depict this. 

Take Chip and Potato on Netflix. The parents aren’t portrayed as real in that show. They never express frustration or negative emotions when the kids do something wrong. It is just kind of fake and manufactured. 

Bluey is not. I can’t believe I’m sitting here in bed singing the praises of a children’s cartoon but I’ll be damned if it isn’t all true lol

kticu2,"Answer: Lot of semi-right/half-wrong answers on this one. Crab Rave was a song by the Artist [Noisestorm](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMxqfxGRX07XOoFfyaM-eYA) released on April 1st, 2018, and uploaded to both [his](https://youtu.be/cE0wfjsybIQ) and the [Monstercat Youtube Channels](https://youtu.be/LDU_Txk06tM), where it found its initial popularity due to being a catchy song with an absurd music video. Despite having a few [song mash-ups](https://youtu.be/YmHwmX2YFRs), it didn't get much popularity until the summer, where it began being used in ironic/absurdist meme humor.  
YouTuber [apandah tweeted from their now suspended account](https://twitter.com/twitter/status/1020326133278150658) a video of the crabs during the hook dancing, captioned ""OBAMA IS GONE"". [Here is a re-upload, or at the very least, a similar recreation of the original video.](https://youtu.be/72D6nqwwNNM) This is where the meme began, and it started getting passed around meme communities, but wasn't fully mainstream until around a month later, around the passing of Senator John McCain. The day he died, a user tweeted a meme of the crabs simply saying [""JOHN MCCAIN IS DEAD""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEqwGK205aM). This made the meme go viral, as it was so recent after the news was broken that many people found out about John McCain's passing from the meme itself (I can't find the original viral tweet nor many of the viral responses, but here is a [Twitter search showing that the sentiment was a thing in 2018](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%22%22John%20McCain%22%22%20crab&src=typed_query)).  
Since then, the meme has been used as a general ""[thing] IS GONE"" celebration or absurd way of sharing tragic news (""[person] IS DEAD""), usually followed by the crab emoji. This meme had a relatively short time in the spotlight, but has survived in teen- and young-adult-culture as a common expression. [Here is a search on reddit of ""IS GONE 🦀"", to show how popular it is on Reddit alone.](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=IS+GONE+%F0%9F%A6%80&restrict_sr=&sort=top&t=all)  
Now, you are seeing it used to celebrate Donald Trump being permanently suspended from Twitter, and some subreddits about him being removed from Reddit.",2021-01-09 16:49:30

I had forgotto mention that he has also reviewed a lot of hate for who he has worked with. He's worked with: a person being charged for sexual assault (I believe and is in court facing the charges) who is a General lawyer is is not really the best for going against an alleged criminal. A very well known doxxer - who he has said he is not working with but the doxxer has released conversations with hansen after he made that statement that are opposite to what he said. He also worked with someone who was just trolling him and he took that gentleman's word as fact (even though the guy said he was gonna troll him). 

He got exposed for not doing any research on the things that are being investigated either. 

He is also underfire for having guests on that do nothing for the case or basically have made it a joke - someone who runs a blog and was told that someone's friend had severely harmed themselves and that person had watched one of those being investigated. They drew a connection without solid proof.

Sorry, I meant to just end it after the first 2 main points but I remembered other things he is under fire for. I'm glad I was able to impart some information though🙂

Edit: he's also in hot water with the online community as someone he used to work with is leading the trust and safety committee of a certain social media site. There is wide speculation (and photographic proof released by the doxxer) of conversations between Chris and said person not long before a handful of creators accounts got suspended for a reason that the social media site never uses.

It is an interdisciplinary field that originated in the study of computational humanities. Essentially, it is the marriage of computer science and information technology with the humanities.

Anyone who studies a wide range of topics like the performing arts, digital media, archaeology, museum curation, psychology, philosophy, social media and damn near anything else that produces research and records that should be preserved and made publicly available will have dabbled in the field of digital humanities.

My background is public information and digital media journalism. I got my start in the military in media relations and journalism and very quickly learned the value of digital media asset management and transparency. After leaving the service I found myself at every position I held overhauling visual imagery archives and working to make my employer compliant with their legal transparency and digital records preservation obligations.

I stumbled across the DH master's program and realized that I had been doing some of the work already but that there was much, much more to the field. For example, I never expected to learn about GIS and deep maps in my life but I sure did.

xs6eku,"Haha, yeah it is a bit of an oddball field. 

Regarding concentration camps, the preservation and archival of all types of records from the Holocaust is/was of great importance to humanists in general, but digitizing and archiving all of the information related to it and making it all available to the public and to academics was a massive undertaking. Clearly that mission was not in vain given the amount of Holocaust deniers that need to be occasionally slapped in the face with the images and records from that dispicable time in human history. It's thanks to the work of the digital humanities that all of those records have been digitized and made widely available and accessable.

As for what I do, lol, it's not near as impressive as the work of Holocaust archivists, but I cut and pasted my response to another commenter here:

Never portraying Israel negatively? Portray Israel? *Portray*? Is that what lobbyists do again? Control the media? Hmm I wonder if there are any conspiracy theories about groups controlling the media.

To sum this up as an (implied secretive) Israel lobby as opposed to the *fact* that Israel is an important US strategic ally in the region and American Jews as a voter block (who are kinda associated with New York) disproportionately support Israel is... problematic at best.

And to be clear, do pro-Israel lobbyists exist? Yes. Are pro-Israel lobbyists the reason Israel is an ally of the United States? Obviously not.

Had a framed picture of him that said “I ❤️ Elon” in his living room that someone had given him as a gift, several SpaceX clothing items, even a pair of socks with Elon’s face on them. I thought it was kind of odd, but all part of some inside joke with his friends that he just kept up with. I realized it was entirely real when I said Elon was kind of a douche. He got so upset that he told me that I was a “bad person” and “just jealous because you’re stupid and he’s a genius”. This obviously should have been a major red flag, but he was so manipulative in other ways that I just kind of swept it under the table. 

Fast forward to a year later and I’ve discovered that he’s (my ex) a narcissist, compulsive liar, and completely incapable of any guilt or remorse. He’s basically a card carrying psychopath. These are things my therapist has said, I personally don’t care for how easily the term narcissist is thrown around. The emotional abuse I endured in our relationship has had a very severe impact on my life and ability to function normally. I realize how dramatic all of this sounds, trust me.

They left me alone for a while... then they came back pushing close times so I sent everyone home at the latest I could without getting crap, and finished closing my damn self.

Currently, I’m doing research on it but cannot find reputable sources (I’m finding articles ranging from “popsugar, yahoo, Pinterest, etc.,) and I try to use more valid online articles.  

I encourage anyone who finds a valid article to comment it in my thread as I do not like to spread misinformation myself, and like to stay correctly informed! ✨. 

Edit: the only reputable information I could find was a tweet from her account in 2020 where she addressed her deletion of the *toddlers and tiaras tweet from 2013* among 28,000 (she corrected, *60,000) other tweets. She is understandably upset from the backlash, calling everyone who pointed it out “idiots”. And claimed she was worried for her family. Here it is:

If you took my information as “attacking” Chrissy Teigen or viewing it as a “sacrificial lamb” type of issue, that was your perception, and I cannot do anything about that. It was not my intention, and I do not believe I came off that way. I am not a part of the problem. I was informative nothing more.  

Also, you took my words out of context saying that I had stated *Chrissy Teigen was bullying a baby”* I said that she took to Twitter to “publicly make fun of their name” (them being the baby).  

Also, you are claiming I am a part of the problem with society, yet claiming “it’s extremely commonplace that people insult parents over the name of their child” even though I feel this is not okay. This is hypocrisy.  

You do not make any sense and you are just here to argue with me for no good reason. This is clear because you were the the very first one to cast a stone in my comment thread basically saying I’m on a high horse just for being informative and calling out toxic behavior then lashing out at me thereafter.

9suwzh,"Let's break this down into a couple of questions, because context is king:

**What's the Fourteenth Amendment, anyway?**

Basically, the rule is that if you're born in the USA, you're a US citizen. The Fourteenth Amendment states it pretty clearly, and that's the way it's been treated for well over a century at this point. It begins:

>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.

If you're born in the USA, you have what's known as [*jus soli*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli) citizenship: citizenship by place of birth, as opposed to [*jus sanguinis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis) citizenship, which comes from blood (that is to say, from your parents' citizenship). (There are *some* exceptions to this, like for example the children of diplomats who aren't 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof', but these are rare. Generally speaking, if you pop a sprog between Canada and Mexico, that kid has US citizenship by birthright.) This has been considered pretty much a settled question in jurisprudence ever since about 1898, in [*United States v. Wong Kim Ark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Wong_Kim_Ark).

**Why's everyone talking about this now?**

Trump noted [in an interview](https://www.axios.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-0cf4285a-16c6-48f2-a933-bd71fd72ea82.html) that he wants to prevent the children of people who aren't US citizens who are born on US soil from automatically becoming US citizens themselves.

>* ""It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don't,"" Trump said, declaring he can do it by executive order.

>* When told that's very much in dispute, Trump replied: ""You can definitely do it with an Act of Congress. But now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order.""

>* ""We're the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States ... with all of those benefits,"" Trump continued. ""It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. And it has to end.""

>* ""It's in the process. It'll happen ... with an executive order.""

**Is that right?**

Not even close.

The problem, at least as far as Trump is concerned, is that he can't actually do that. Changing a constitutional amendment is *hard*. He's *claimed* it just requires an executive order, but you can't overturn the Constitution by executive order and so he's shit out of luck. (If you don't believe me, you can at least believe [Paul Ryan](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/30/politics/birthright-citizenship-executive-order-trump-paul-ryan/index.html), or any of [these eleven legal experts](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/30/18042638/trump-birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment-legal-experts). If you think this is a bad idea, I'd urge you to consider how you'd feel if a given President felt he could overturn the First, Second or Fifth Amendments with a single, unregulated stroke of the pen, and then get back to me. Hell, what if a President felt that he could overturn the Twenty-Second Amendment and do away with presidential term limits entirely?) It's also important to note Trump's sneaky little lie:

>We're the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States ... with all of those benefits

Yes, it is true that the USA is the only country in the world where a person is (not essentially but *actually and completely*) a citizen of the United States, but only because it'd be pretty strange if it were the case that being born in France, Rwanda or Equatorial Guinea could grant you US citizenship. About thirty countries, including Brazil and Canada, also have unrestricted *jus soli* citizenship. The USA is rare, perhaps, but by no means unique in that regard.

This also butts heads with another weird little quirk of US citizenship: if you're a US citizen, by *jus soli* or *jus sanguinis*, [you have to pay taxes to the US *even if you're not in the country*.](http://time.com/money/4298634/expat-expatriate-taxes-us-myths/) There's only one other country that taxes non-resident citizens in this way (and it's Eritrea, so if you guessed that ahead of time I'm very impressed). This has led to the situation where people who were born in the USA to foreign parents -- say, an early birth while on holiday -- are citizens of and must legally pay taxes to a country that they haven't been to since (and [also register for the draft](https://www.americansabroad.org/requirements-of-us-citizenship/)).

**Who told him he could do it?**

In the interview, Trump said, 'You can definitely do it with an Act of Congress. But now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order.' Who are *they*?

Well, no one knows as yet. The person to look out for is probably Trump's immigration *doyen* (read into that what you will), [Stephen Miller](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/stephen-miller-family-separation/563132/). Most of the big Trump immigration policies have come via Miller's office, including the Muslim travel ban(s), the separation of children from their parents at the border, discontinuation of funding to 'sanctuary cities', and The Wall™. *Politico* has noted that this is an idea that Miller has been [involved with previously in the Trump Administration](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/30/trump-birthright-citizenship-949660), so several news outlets are suggesting his potential involvement. (This may become very interesting in the coming days, if the rumoured Trump post-election shakeup happens; if Miller *has* had a lot of influence on this policy decision, his continuance as one of the most prominent faces in the Trump White House may wax or wane depending on the result of the midterms.) 

**So what's the big deal?**

I know, I know... at this point, 'Trump says he's going to do something he can't legally do' is a bit of a [dog-bites-man news story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_bites_dog_(journalism\)), but this is coming only a week out from an extremely important mid-term election in which the Republicans are expected to lose the House (unlikely also the Senate, but the odds of that are still higher than people were giving Trump of winning in 2016, so who even knows at this point?). Tough talk on migrants riles up the Republican base, and Trump needs that turnout to have any chance of legislative victories in the two remaining years of his term.

This dovetails nicely with the migrant caravan that is currently moving through Mexico and heading towards the United States. Trump and other Republican higher-ups are using the opportunity to stoke fear into the hearts of voters, claiming -- incorrectly -- [that this is an invasion](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1056919064906469376) (hyperbole), [that Democrats want an open border](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1054354059535269888), [that there are gang members and Middle-Easterners using the caravan to sneak across the border](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1054351078328885248) (no evidence), and that people crossing in the caravan are doing so illegally. It's the last that's the most insidious, especially given that [he tried to pull the same shit when it came to the child detention debacle earlier this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/8s3bfa/what_is_the_deal_with_the_kids_in_concentration/e0we6r5/); in short, the caravan is not behaving illegally *yet*. The expectation is that when they arrive in the USA, the vast majority of them will claim asylum from the dangerous conditions in their home countries, which is a right granted by the USA to anyone on the planet.

This push for fear with regards to the caravan is pretty much everywhere because it works to get Republican-leaning individuals incensed enough to take the time out of their days to head to the polls. (Voter engagement is expected to be one of the Democrats' biggest advantages in the midterms, which are not traditionally considered a particularly sexy election cycle.) However, notable breaks from the President's rhetoric include Fox News anchor Shep Smith, who said on Monday:

>There is no invasion. No one’s coming to get you. There’s nothing at all to worry about. But tomorrow is one week before the midterm election — which is what all of this is about.

There is likely no better summation of the context of the story than that.",2018-10-31 02:59:42

Just look at these comments man it’s literally an echo chamber, I saw some one here trying to say that men only go for the top 5% of women 💀 these people don’t live in reality. Your average guy gets little to no likes on dating apps while even the ugliest of women will get hundreds of likes as soon as they open their account. They downvote anyone who doesn’t fit their narrative. Me personally I’m either not getting married or marrying someone from the east and getting a prenup. Marriage in the west is horrible deal for any man no matter how you look at it.",2022-08-17 23:11:33

If you believe efficient homemaking and child rearing are as complex and nuanced as repairing cars and building infrastructure, then that might be a large part of the problem tbh. No wonder men shy away from household responsibilities 😅

wqhp8v,"Yeah and let me tell ya, when both parties expect that; it's a complete disaster. I mentioned that I once was guilty of doing this and as such got into a couple of relationships with like minded women. We wanted to fix each other and to be fixed by each other and it created a vicious cycle of mental abuse on both ends, both of us dumping our baggage onto one another. Life lessons learned the hard way, right?
I'm glad I took a step back to learn what the issue was and it certainly opened my eyes to the bigger picture in relationships. 

Seriously if you're reading this and you've been dating and dating and dating and not finding any luck, take some time to be in a relationship with yourself. The longer you go, the more you see the problems in other relationships (including those from your past) and become an expert at spotting red flags. Riding solo can become addicting, though, so reader discretion is advised 😉. Kind of a weird wink, but I'm leaving it.",2022-08-17 17:09:13
wqhp8v,"I mean, it’s not a contest but you fell for bad people masquerading as good, twice, and married them! It’s all about being a good judge of character yourself and not taking it all the way to marriage until you know for sure that that person is going to be good to you. 

I’m definitely not a victim, Lmaoo. I’m literally citing studies. I’ve also never been married bc I broke things off when the person showed themselves to be a poor partner to me. Im in a relationship now where there is reciprocity, I don’t need counseling. I just stopped letting people in who weren’t as intent on growth and being a good partner, as I was. I definitely feel like I have value 😅 I’m just saying that women are taught to take what they can get or risk the guy going and looking for someone better. 

I NEVER see a guy out in public with an SO who is less attractive than him. That is super rare. Like I’m telling you, your experience is more the exception than the rule, sorry. It doesn’t make it less valid but it is a poor supporting point when you try to stack it up against studies upon studies (that I cited to earlier, they could all be found with a simple internet search). That all show the opposite. 

As for your dating life now? Sounds sad no offense. And sounds like you are going after the same type of girl, a user. Or maybe those are the only types that are drawn to you. Maybe a genuine non-user girl is repelled by you in some way? Or maybe you just view everyone as a user bc of your past experience. Example, I want my bf to take care of me when we’re married and hold down the finances while I raise kids. That doesn’t make me a user. I stack savings and split everything with him in the meantime. I also earn more than him. So yeah I want him to hold it down later on and you would probably call that using but it’s not.",2022-08-17 17:23:45

wqhp8v,"Agree with all except that women want men who are less masculine and that all masculinity is toxic like what? 

And this is hilarious but to your very last paragraph you are literally describing my boyfriend 😆 he is exactly that. A monster but a tamed one. A bad boy on the outside but is tender and caring to me. He does fighting/martial arts/combat training for sport and as an outlet for a lifelong rage issue. He can be a hard-ass to the outside world but he kneeled down and put ointment and bandaids on a painful scrape on my leg just the other day. Hey may have had an aggression problem he has spent years taming it via religion, meditation, physical activity, and stoicism. He’s the epitome of positive masculinity. The anger and aggression are definitely his “flaws” but again they’re well-managed and they’re an expression of deep-seated character traits of his that include discipline, emotional strength, strong boundaries, a strong backbone, reliability, and a caring/protecting tendency.

f08p68,"Answer: I feel like I need to add some stuff for the answers. Reddit, Twitter, and other online forums tend to be biased towards Bernie. I'm not trying to say you shouldn't like Bernie, or that you should like Pete. I just want to try to paint an unbiased picture, and also hopefully make it short and to the point. 

Previous to the caucuses, a gold-standard level poll was scheduled to come out, but was shelved after the Pete campaign informed them Pete was left off at least one poll. After further investigation, it came out that one operator had enlarged the font on her screen, causing the bottom candidate to not be mentioned. This list was randomized, meaning each call it was a different candidate being left off the list, it just so happens the Buttigieg campaign discovered the inconsistency and reported it. The Des Moines poll was considered the gold standard, so in order to keep this reputation, they cancelled the poll. 

In previous years, the only metric that was released from Iowa was the number of state delegates won by each candidate, showing a clear and decisive winner. After complaints in previous years that this doesn't show the whole picture, new rules were implemented this year to show more information in an attempt to be more transparent. 

So a quick summary of how the Iowa caucuses worked: people lined up behind candidates in each precinct. In short, this is the first alignment. Then any candidate with less than 15% in that precinct can ""realign"", and go line up behind another candidate. This is the second and final alignment. Finally, similar to the electoral college, state delegate equivalents (SDEs) are assigned for each precinct. The difference this year is that now first alignment stats, second alignment stats, and SDEs are now reported. This is why though Bernie won the first alignment by 6000ish votes, and the second alignment by 2000ish votes, it was virtually tied (Pete had like a .1% lead, but I mean, personally I consider that a tie) by measure of SDEs. 

Pete did claim victory the night of the caucuses, yes. This was based off of his internal reports from precinct captains, with internal results from around 77% of the precincts. ~~Bernie was also pushing the narrative internally that he won, but with only 40% of precincts.~~ (_See edit 1_)

That said, I can’t bring myself to actually wish him death or anything (there’s very few people I actively *want* to die, after all) but I honestly wouldn’t be shocked if he does end up committing suicide. Given that he genuinely *does* seem to be something of a sociopath and not just playing one on TV, from the claims made about him (including claims that he’s *still* contacting victims), to his own statements basically feeling like “I’m only sorry I got caught”, while they (socios, psychos, narcissists etc) generally think much too highly of themselves to off themselves, I think suicide for him would more than likely be simply to avoid any legal consequences. I honestly can’t imagine anything of his marriage could be salvaged, and he’s unlikely to be able to find much in the way of a job after this. Someone pointed out a couple days ago that Ryan isn’t his first name, which while true is still actually part of his real name and not a stage name or anything. If he had to register as a sex offender for example, you can’t only use the name you *want* to use instead of your full legal name.

I highly doubt you have an issue with this when you gladly turn a blind eye to the 2009 ARRA giving over half a billion in tax breaks through the department of energy to Solyndra to file for bankruptcy less than 2 years later. *It's not like that money could've been put to better use by, say, improving the local utility power infrastructure so there won't be a [need to shutoff power as to avoid more wild fire causing destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Gas_and_Electric_Company#2019_bankruptcy)*. But by the message you convey, aligned with the democratic party's elected officials and voters prove, is that tax breaks for specific corporations are acceptable since they are enacted by the Democratic party 😂 I like how I don't bring up President Trump but you feel a need to your subpar counterpoint because of that ""orange man bad"" mindset.

> you guy

Who the fuck is you guys? Making claims without a premise isn't going to help you prove any points 😅

> mobilized to go spread the good word about Solyndra.

This just shows you how ignorant you are because I'm the only person you'll find bringing up Solyndra regularly when I called out left-wing bullshit because it's my bully pulpit, it happened in my hometown under complete democrat party rule and it completely failed after a huge tax break given to only one corporation so it in turn is all I need to prove how the Democrat party never gave a shit about normal people but keep drinking that Jim Jones' kool-aid you've been bathing in 🤣😭

> It's almost like you guys all get your talking points from the same place.

I get my news from the BBC World Service so I don't require stimulation when I get their daily hour report. What is your main news source?

g2au73,"> You're the twelfth person I've seen bring this up

It's not whataboutism since my point isn't to give a 'gotcha answer,' like you're falsely conveying, but as an indicator to what you find to be an actual issue (which corruption by members of the Democrat party is not an issue in your eyes). I have the bully pulpit when it comes to Solyndra because it happened right in front of my fucking eyes and can trace directly how giving a tax break greater than half a billion dollars to one corporation does not help the macro or micro-economy. 

> Trump awarding a $55 million contract to a fake company.

[I looked up a fact-check for the validity of your framed claim](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trump-falsely-claims-he-inherited-empty-stockpile/) and the truth I found actually is regarding the Strategic National Stockpile, not some ""shell company"" like you are making hyperbolic claims over. If you actually read into this then you would see how the stockpile was depleted after the 2009 H1N1 virus outbreak and a deficit of tens of millions of N95 masks was never fulfilled since then. But obviously you're just showing yourself to be avoiding facts at this point so I don't expect you to criticize former President Obama for giving billions in corporate tax breaks and refusing to restock the SNS after he created a supply deficit 🙄 Just admit economics and finance is far from your strong suit because you're making yourself look like a fool in your response 😂

But I had a cool young Romanian teacher in highschool and he took me and a few friends of mine (girls and boys) out on his boat.

nrjvml,"Answer: 

As a ""mind my own business and it's not my job to prosthelytize,"" fringe-belief (definitely not the mainstream, well-known kind of) Christian, I will say that it is hard to talk about being a Christian or discuss/debate Christian ideas, even on supposedly like-minded Christian spaces because people who are against Christianity in general invade those spaces just to cause chaos and strife. It's much less prominent in the Hindu and pagan spaces I'm part of (See what I mean by fringe?), but it does still happen there.

... That being said, I still don't think we're being discriminated against in real life nearly as much as the right wing evangelicals would like to believe. In real life, no one is coming up to us and calling us ""[f-ing] idiots who worship a magical sky daddy,"" which happens quite a lot in online spaces. I think it's more that people who aren't familiar with internet trolling and vitriol take it as personally as if someone came up to them in public and said the same thing to their face. Like, late gen xers/baby boomers who got social media in the last 10 years and think their Facebook groups have the same level of sanctity as a Wednesday night Bible study group, and are then outraged when non-believers come in solely to troll. 🧿🧿🧿",2021-06-04 01:27:01
nrjvml,"What the heck kind of small world do you live in? We don't try to fight anything. We don't even try cussing out people. We're a Group of people who just tells the Truth in a Loving way (or at least Try) and nothing more. No pettiness should be spoken, but because everybody is imperfect someone who is a Christian can go too far too. 

For example, in War if the ""Good"" guys trying to end the War against Hitler and all the other Wicked leaders, why was there people from the ""Good"" guys side raping the women (who were just innocent citizens) from the Bad Guys side? Why were there Bad Guys on the ""Good"" Guys side? Why do they imitate the same belief as the Bad Guys and act on it? Because there's no such thing as a ""Good"" Guy. There are only people who are Bad who can ""Try"" to be ""Good"". That's why there's a given opportunity to repent. Because God knows that no matter what, we sin. 

And see the problem with people is, they Generalize easily. If I told someone I'm Christian, they're automatically gonna think in the back of their head ""oh, he's gonna be a person who discriminates a type of people"". Like what the heck bro? 😂 Y'all know the Good News is for everybody right? Therefore meaning, God's Love is not discriminatory. I'm not gonna go up to a person and start name calling and start cussing at them and degrade them LOLOL. I'm not even gonna be petty if the conversation goes sour. 

Don't generalization people because of a Drama you went through personally when you should know that not everyone is the same.

>We also have new reporting tonight on the Mueller report, expected at any time.   
>  
>All eyes were on Robert Mueller as he arrived at work today, even president trump talking about the report in the last 24 hours, saying, let the public see it. Well, tonight, right here, what our Jon Karl has just learned, what not to expect when this report comes. Reporter: Wearing a baseball cap and driving himself, Robert Mueller arrived at his office today amidst widespread speculation his investigation is about to end.   
>  
>Tonight, sources familiar with the probe tell ABC news they expect no more indictments from the special counsel. I asked the president whether the public will get a chance to see Mueller's final report. Does the American public have a right to see the Mueller report? I don't mind. I mean, frankly, I told the house, if you want, let them see it. Let it come out. Let people see it. That's up to the attorney general. We have a very good attorney general, he's a very highly respected man, and we'll see what happens. Reporter: President trump says he wants to see the report himself. I think it's ridiculous, but I want to see the report. Reporter: So, what will the report say about the president and any others who are not indicted? Today, a clue, in form of a little-noticed letter written last year by a man who has overseen the investigation, deputy attorney general rod Rosenstein. In that letter, Rosenstein made it clear there would not be a replay of what former FBI director James Comey did in June 2016, when he held a news conference harshly criticizing Hillary Clinton, even as he announced she would not be indicted. As Rosenstein wrote, ""We also have a duty to prevent the disclosure of information that would unfairly tarnish people who are not charged with crimes."" Jon Karl live at the white house again tonight. And Jon, I want to get back to your reporting late today, your sources telling you tonight they do not expect anymore indictments from the special counsel? Reporter: David, I am told not to expect anymore indictments from the special counsel, but as white house officials are keenly aware, that is not the end of the special counsel investigations not an end to investigations related to the president of the united States. There are still multiple criminal investigations and, of course, David, Democrats in congress are just getting started. All right, Jon Karl with us. Jon, thank you.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

Of course she is 🙄. And 20 years late? Listen, can we just be done with this experiment we've all been running called religion? It's absolutely apparent that having humans believe that certain works of fiction are Divinely inspired is at odds with a cooperative and functioning society (both on a micro and macro level). We've developed the tools to make rationally-minded ethical decisions without needing to consult holy scripture. Can we just ditch these wild-ass, irrational ideas and just start living in the here-and-now and being, like, good to each other?

Sorry, didn't mean for this to become a religious diatribe... Holding out hope for the best, but just feeling sad and worried and angry about these kids who didn't deserve whatever it is that's happened to them.",2020-02-16 11:25:28

ogvvfl,">Correct me if I'm wrong but it sounds like the complaint is plainly that there aren't enough black people in the movie. Afro-latino just sounds like another way of describing black people which I don't get. Black people can be many nationalities so why do Latino black people get a different description? Jamaicans, Haitians, Africans are all considered black people although their from vastly different regions.

I mean, afro-latino does describe a subgroup of Black people. Like in the same way how Black could describe people from the places you mentioned above but Jamaican vs Haitian give much more specific information, i think that afro-latino just specifies a group of people who are Black and Latino. i also think that afro-latino is a broad term, and that it doesn't supercede national identity. Like a person can be afro-latino and Dominican and have a different experience and identity than an afro-latino person who is Puerto Rican. I feel like things like race and ethnicity and nationality exist in a weird relationship that's messy, but it's still worth talking about how these things interact. 
 

>don't see many white Latinos represented as Latinos in movies so maybe I should start bringing attention to this as well. People should know that Latinos don't stop at light brown

I mean, i think you should. I don't think that discussions about representation are a zero-sum game. You could talk about how both Black and White Latino communities could get some more representation. Especially in a move that focuses on a pretty diverse Hispanic community like In The Heights. 

>Sometimes there as white a any other white person. Is there a name for that btw?


Idk 🤷‍♀️. I think White Latino works, but im not really apart of the community. I guess you could try Whitino lol. I think i saw a twitter post or something that said Afro-latino was originally made for academic research, so i feel like it popped up recently in discourse. I feel like it's still helpful as a term to describe Black people who are also Latino (I also feel like it rolls off the tongue well and just sounds smoother than Black Latino/Latina/latinx).",2021-07-10 01:32:14

One of my kids is too old for cuddling and the other is just starting to get clingy 😭 the first time I saw it I started sobbing in front of the older one, probably the first time she’s seen me cry, and all I could blurt out was “I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!” 

The other is when Bandit has to travel for work and does something fun with Bingo earlier in the episode to soften the blow of telling her he has to leave on a plane. For how long and why he suddenly has to travel for work are not mentioned to the audience. Are they relocating him? Is this the beginning of a separation story arc!? What is happening!! And then I’m like oh my god they’re making me feel what a kid feels when a parent leaves because they don’t fully understand for different reasons. Especially if you don’t communicate well!

I think the best comparison is the football one I gave before, or ones related to video games for example. Someone just talking at the camera for an hour, and so many kids watch it, hooked on the entirety. Yet the content itself is abysmal, or derivative and unoriginal.

They've never had to turn the heating off because they couldn't afford to warm their bedrooms in the winter. They've never run out of sick days.

All that's needed is a second, specific referendum: to put forward a vote that says, 'Look, this is the deal we've got. After three years it really is the best deal we're going to get. Do you want it, or not? If you vote yes, it becomes law tomorrow; if you don't, we'll go back to the way things were in 2015 and tear up our exit papers.' I mean, I'm generally a proponent of the idea that truth resists simplicity, but the way things are going seems tremendously shortsighted. Most referenda aren't legally binding, for precisely this reason. (In fact, this one wasn't either.) There's a reason for that.

Now yes, the Conservatives would take their lumps for putting everyone through all this for so long based on [nothing but political hubris](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/8xc5ft/what_is_happening_with_uk_politics_and_why_is/), but the idea of it not being The Will of the People™ wouldn't really hold up.

Considering they haven't explained this as it's racing through social media like wildfire, Google is now like most corporations in the 2010s thinking they are too big to fail and it's okay to trash the customers. I've been a loyal Gmail user since college (I was the only one in my friendgroup who jumped to Google) and have relied on Gmail not just for personal, intimate, and vital emails, but also for my work. And AdSense (and others under Alphabet) have been an absolute failure stopping malware from leaking into their ads so I will not stop adblocking websites out of personal safety. 

It sucks, but if any Google employee is here, you're losing a loyal customer. I won't submit to such Draconian attitude. Because I won't let Alphabet hijack my life all because I'm not allowing their security failures to infect my computer. Some email services may not be so flashy, but they sure won't delete my entire account and livelihood out of an emote or adblock. And not only that, I'm warning everyone about this, normies and those with some IT sense! So, it's not just one customer, but many who might and will migrate from Google products.

bguoxf,"Additionally, there is pretty strong evidence that many of the kids who are being diagnosed with ADHD/ADD actually have pre-apnea/sleep apnea which is a rising crisis in children.

This isn’t my field of study, it’s my lab mate’s, but here is a blog post: https://www.alaskasleep.com/blog/adhd-vs-osa about it from the Alaska Sleep Clinic and another: https://childmind.org/article/adhd-sleep-disorders-misdiagnosed/ from Childmind.org.

It’s pretty clear medically that if you treat a child’s lack of facial bone growth (due to a soft diet, usually) that their symptoms will resolve. Dr. Kevin Boyd in Chicago has a rather revolutionary pre-apnea dental clinic that aims to treat children early and who has seen resolution of the behavioral issues often diagnosed as ADHD after just a couple months of treatment.

Edit: Not sure why my markdown wasn’t working, and I don’t have time to fiddle with it. 😬",2019-04-24 16:53:21
bguoxf,"I’m a person diagnosed and previously medicated for ADHD (inattentive), so this is purely anecdotal: 

While I 100% agree with you that taking ADHD meds won’t *cause* you to become an alcoholic, I think it’s extremely important to note and address the correlation between the increases addiction and substance abuse behaviors demonstrated by kids medicated for ADHD and the fact that these kids are popping pills that buzz them harder than any energy drink or coffee. 

Between the ages of  8-13 and 16-19 years old, I was prescribed and actively taking 30 mg of dexmethylphenidate every morning and 15 midday. I finally felt fast enough mentally to keep up with my own thoughts, and I could sit for more than 30 minutes to focus on a task. The flip side was that I loved that string buzz each morning, and that euphoric rush kept me eager to learn—and eager to take my pills. 

I didn’t realize at 8 or even 18 years old that I was building a habit of getting high, I was just following doctors orders. 

This is only my experience, but after I slowly weaned off my meds, my depression relapsed, my weight shot up, and I went from smoking weed maybe once or twice a month to smoking 2-3 times a day, especially first thing in the morning. I think after so many formative years of feeling a chemical euphoric rush every morning with a little midday bump, I simply swapped from pills to kush. 

Surprisingly, my academics stayed the same and I graduated cum laude, I got a better job, I ended an unhealthy relationship and started a new one, and I’m using diet and exercise to combat the depression and weight gain. 

Still blazing every day though, we all gotta have a vice 🌲🌲🌲",2019-04-24 17:01:35
bguoxf,"Yeah it's an ADHD thing. It's very common for our people to drink a lot of coffee to stay calm and focused throughout the day. Then we drink booze or smoke weed at night to sleep because the caffeine is calming but still interferes with sleep patterns, and the booze and weed gives us another little dopamine bump before bed. Then we wake up the next day and the cycle continues. fml right? 😂 People complain about the meds but don't take into account all the awful things we dump into ourselves without the meds. We're going to medicate ourselves no matter what, the meds are just cutting out the bullshit to get there.",2019-04-24 18:43:37

And don’t be afraid to seek that diagnosis/help, whatever that might look like for you, if and when you feel you’re ready. While I can’t personally speak to the ADHD treatment side of things, I’ve seen many a counsellor/psychologist/psychiatrist myself over the years.

wpm1kw,"It's redshifted, because the object that emitted it is moving away from us faster.  (Mostly because the space between it and us is expanding.)

This was part of a different article I found on this topic, I just cut that out for simplicity.  Basically the light that JWST looked at *is* redshifted in a way that's consistent with light from something that far away / that old... But so far JWST hasn't had time or used more sensitive instruments to tell if that's because the thing actually *is* that far away, of the light got redshifted in some other way.  

Apparently light can sometimes get absorbed and re-emitted by a dust cloud in between us and the object, making it redder than we would otherwise expect, even though the object is actually closer / not moving away as fast, for example. This apparently has already been shown to be true for *some* of the things JWST looked at, but it could be true for more or all of them.  

Before you ask... Idk how they have shown that for some things and not others though 🤷",2022-08-16 12:28:49
wpm1kw,"I'm not a physicist or astronomer or whatever, but from what I understand, my eli5 is:

basically every time you look at an object you're not exactly seeing the object itself. You're seeing the light that emits and reflects from that object. Light from celestial objects naturally takes a long time to reach us so that means that if you take a telescope and point it at a galaxy/planet/nebula/whatever that's an unfathomable distance away from earth, you're not seeing it in its current state - you're seeing the light emitting from it that has just reached Earth (or to be more accurate - the telescope's lens). To use a fun example to illustrate this, it means that at any time the space telescope is pointed at an incredibly distant solar system, it's possible that that system might be inhabited by an advanced space-faring civilization at the stage of harnessing its star for power, but it's so far away that we might as well be seeing it in its prehistoric age.

In this case, I did also Google something like ""Did the JWST disprove the big bang?"" and read or skimmed a couple (I think 2) other articles to get some idea of what people who *weren't* anxious to ""disprove"" the big bang were saying.

Yeah if you had stepped off safe space Reddit for 2 seconds this would not have been so shocking to you. Reddit is an echo chamber whose demographic is not representative of everybody or the majority, nearly as much as Redditors would like to think it is. Just look at the comments in this subreddit.

They see what they want to see. He literally increased the expected uncommitted votes in Michigan 10X from 10k to 100k, and got 140k votes less than Trump and his supporters were celebrating his win because he got a higher percentage in a much small pool🤣. Also most don’t hate him, he’s so boring and standard and without any ideas or values that he elicits no emotion whether it be hate or love. In fact Trump voters probably hate him less than his supporters as they’re trying to prevent the elder abuse that is wheeling this demented old man to anywhere that is not a nursing home.

Then the pollsters pay the panels and give them the questions to ask, as well as the demographics to ask. 

The people doing the polls then sign on every now and again and answer their questions, then get paid.

We were both 100% joking, as evident in the fact that wanting to die or end it all, well that is the joke. If I get banned or blocked, I’ll understand. But I’d rather anyone who relates to my sentiment be able to see it. 

Anyway so I’m a bit younger than my sister, by about 8 years. She’s more Gen X and I’m the millennial. 

We were discussing said groups, and I told her many reasons why millennials feel the way we tend to feel. 

I round out my points by adding “Yeah everything’s so bad we all just want to die”.

She said “Well if it’s that bad why don’t you all actually kill yourselves then so the rest of us can move on! And if you don’t, Gen Z will when they get older because lemme tell ya those kids are heartless!” 😳😶

Should we ban all homely women from getting plastic surgery? Definitely no woman without curves should get them... wouldn’t want to “fool” anyone. No masculine looking cis women should be allowed to get surgery to appear more feminine. And definitely no removal or hiding of facial hair or body hair. And let’s not treat any hormonal deficiencies in female children! That’s just not how nature intended it! If they don’t have puberty, well, tough shit. Some uptight “lesbian” might not be comfortable knowing that.

What about intersex people who like women? Do we create intersex clubs for those who like women and those who like men? And then, do we further drill down on that by having intersex people with more feminine characteristics who like women in separate clubs than ones with more masculine characteristics who like women? Do we have never-ending drilling down of clubs for people who like women but are slightly different in some way that some women like and others don’t like? Or is that just dating and getting to know literally anyone and deciding what you like and don’t like? 🤔

72sard,"The hate has been here for a while now, subs like /r/CringeAnarchy are filled with cringey posts from R&M fans

&nbsp;

In short, there are three main things that people hate:

1. R&M fans constantly post or create content about some jokes in the show. They might be humorous at first, but after being bought up so many times they all got old. It's just not funny anymore.

2. Even worse, some moments are not intended to be that funny but fans would focus on them and **over-react**. For example, the pickle Rick is quite interesting, but not that hilarious and not made as a joke. Yet we got fans posting reaction videos of them laughing their lungs out, and hundreds of fan art of Rick turning himself into other objects.  It is worth noting that during the episode where Pickle Rick is introduced, not a single character who saw pickle rick laughed. _haha random = funny amirite guise???_

3. Some fans think that only intelligent people can enjoy R&M, and shit on people who don't watch the show. The show isn't that deep, they do bring up topics but never dwell deep into them.

> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

As an NYC resident, I am regularly amazed by the mental gymnastics done by extreme liberals to avoid glaring issues in the black community.

When the police did absolutely nothing about it, a group of neighborhood residents formed a “neighborhood watch” to try and keep a lookout and warn people if they see the attacker again. They posted on Facebook to group everyone together and on their first neighborhood watch meet up, a group of hyper liberal ACAB young adults literally protested the meet up, saying that the black insane attacker simply needs medical help and that “crime” is an illusion twisted to paint the black community in a bad light. One girl literally said “if I were him, I would also be mad that I’m oppressed by society and homeless and starving, I don’t blame him.” in an attempt to defend the dog-murdering piece of shit.",2022-12-04 19:36:06

now often offensive

: mild to severe impairment in intellectual ability equivalent to an IQ of 70 to 75 or below that is accompanied by significant limitations in social, practical, and conceptual skills (as in interpersonal communication, reasoning, or self-care) necessary for independent daily functioning and that has an onset before age 18 : INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY
NOTE: The term intellectual disability is now preferred over mental retardation in medical, educational, and regulatory contexts, as well as in general use. The term mental retardation is increasingly considered offensive, though it was the dominant term into the second decade of the current century.

Vs


Definition of neurodiversity

1: individual differences in brain functioning regarded as normal variations within the human populationPerhaps our difficulty in accepting and adjusting to these differences points to a limited understanding of the neurodiversity that surrounds us.— Serena Puang

2: the concept that differences in brain functioning within the human population are normal and that brain functioning that is not neurotypical should not be stigmatizedNeurodiversity is the idea that variation in brain function exists across the population. Differences such as autism and ADHD have existed throughout human history and are not due to faulty neural circuitry. Rather than viewing them as such, neurodiversity embraces autism as a different way of thinking and behaving.

Vs.

Definition of mental illness

: any of a broad range of medical conditions (such as major depression, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, or panic disorder) that are marked primarily by sufficient disorganization of personality, mind, or emotions to impair normal psychological functioning and cause marked distress or disability and that are typically associated with a disruption in normal thinking, feeling, mood, behavior, interpersonal interactions, or daily functioning



While I agree with what you were trying to say. Your example is incorrect 

mental retardation ➡️ Intellectual disability

While someone considered intellectually disabled or/and mentally ill fall  may fall under the neurodivergent umbrella someone that is neuodivergent doesn't necessarily fall under intellectually disabled or mental ill.

Like, baseball, football, basketball, bowling are all sports but they are not the same sport because they are all played with a type of ball.

The differences in the different groups you referenced are all 'in the brain' (sports) but are not the same 'game'

nq4d34,"Answer: I can’t speak for steel, but for lumber...

1) 2019 was very slow for lumber sales, so a lot of mills slowed down production for 2020

2) a couple of high profile lumber mills (I think in Canada?) closed at the beginning of 2020

3) the pandemic caused workers in the remaining mills and truck drivers to be laid off/furloughed 

4) pandemic, not being able to travel, being home all the time, etc. caused a boom in “nesting” and finishing old DIY projects. Also because people weren’t spending their money on experience/services as much, there was more money to spend on contractors and renovations. This has caused incredible demand for lumber and contractor services

5) the remaining mills are unable to keep supply up with the sudden explosion of demand, and also have had enormous trouble ramping up operations to meet demand because it takes a long time to manufacture lumber under normal circumstances, and every one is low on workers and drivers due to layoffs and furloughs.

As a result, you now pay $80 for a sheet of OSB that cost $11 in 2019, and 60% more for contractors who are so busy they won’t even get to your project this year.

I can’t speak for steel. Sorry, I also lack linking of my sources. I just gripe about lumber 3 times a day, so I’m pretty versed 😅",2021-06-01 23:22:31

tavscu,"I think the language change is meant more for those who aren't mentally ill. Being someone who *is,* using a softer word doesn't really change my perception of suicide, and I imagine you and I aren't alone in that. And while I've grown lucky enough to have found communities that are accepting, among the general population there are unfortunately still plenty of people who believe suicide is selfish/cowardly/a sin/etc and that the mentally ill are dangerous lepers that should be hidden from their view. It took me years to seek help because I hated myself and believed I deserved to feel that way, and feeling surrounded by people who demonized those like me intensified that self-hatred immensely. Even when I finally did reach out, the family I'd confided in treated my depression like some dirty secret that'd ruin my image. Not because keeping it secret would help me in any way, but because of the capital S Stigma™. And yes, I think that simply changing the phrasing would be a weak gesture towards removing that stigma, but I suspect we've got the cause and effect mixed up. As terrible as some of the people around me have been, things overall are still better since generations past where, in many places, suicide was genuinely considered a criminal act (hence the use of ""commit""). Where the mainstream opinion used to be pretty antagonistic, there's an ever-increasing undercurrent of sympathy. The growing acceptance of this new language being used to talk about mental health is probably more of a symptom of the change rather an attempt to spark change.

Sorry if this doesn't make any sense, I've been thinking about this kind of thing a lot lately but my thoughts are still a big jumbled mess.",2022-03-10 20:29:57

128tkej,"Such a thorough and precise answer. China is catching a lot of flack for having these clandestine labs that synthesize or produce these compounds. I used to work in QA and R&D in the medical field when fentanyl was only known as the 72hr patch that was used for legit chronic pain. China is more or less viewed as the wild west of chemicals and its beginning to become known even to the mainstream. You know it’s bad when China starts to crackdown on some of the labs and facilities and even outright banning production of select compounds and regulating how much of certain ones they can produce. It gets even crazier and shows how ahead of the curve the cartels are (and how far behind the acronym organizations are as well): they’ve already started building literal medical grade labs in other countries outside of China with less stringent regulations and laws or where the law can be bought to continue the production of the compounds. It’s going to get to a point to where the only way to stop this issue is to outright ban the use and production of it which is not likely to work at all as it technically already is or to take away the worth of the product from cartels and black market dealers. The only way to do that is to make the substance more available to the users but in the safest way possible. I almost wish they’d just start overprescribing opiates again as at least then it was under the care of a doctor and you were monitored. Also you knew what was in the pill and the exact dosage when you picked it up. Obviously people still abused it but there were less deaths from users, innocent bystanders and most of the time it was a cocktail of more than one drug that ultimately caused the death. That’s absolutely not the answer to this very complicated problem but it was a lot better than some of the compounds I’ve seen come out.

mm34k2,"So, the simple answer is “history”

Northern Ireland was separated from Ireland in the early 1920’s and is predominantly inhabited by ‘Unionists’, descendants of Britain (mostly English) that were Protestant Christians having loyalty to the Crown of England and Great Britain while the rest of Ireland are... Irish, Irish who lean to Dublin, are a part of the separate country the Republic of Ireland, and are predominantly Catholic. 

It is important to note that NI has been inhabited by these British descendants for centuries, and inter-marriage and inter-relationships have made the ethnically Irish and English-British (English/Scot/Welsh) bloodlines there intertwined... which leads to even messier divides when it comes to answering the question: “Are we British or Irish?”

The Irish and British (especially the English) have had rough history, often times stemming from difficult times imposed on the Irish by the British, unfortunately.

Edit: Even today the answer as to why they don’t want to be reunified stems from deep rooted differences in identity in what it means to be Irish, English, Scottish, Welsh... such small islands for such diverse culture 🤷🏻‍♂️",2021-04-07 19:26:09

Now, and this point, I have not heard a peep out of Southwest. Figuring that my flight would indeed get canceled at some point today, I preemptively booked a flight out on Spirit Airlines. Well, they were delayed about an hour, but dammit they didn’t come through this time and got me my butt back to Sac in time for work tomorrow.

dgas2g,"Exactly. The humour in RuPaul’s is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of queer culture most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There is also RuPaul’s fierce outlook which is deftly woven into his characteristics - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Lady Bunny and Bianca Del Rio literature for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have an intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike RuPauls Drag Race truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in RuPaul’s existential catchphrase “It’s time to lip sync for your life”, which itself is a cryptic reference to Katya Zamolodchikova’s Russian epic Cherrybomb. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as RuPaul’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, I DO have a RuPauls Drag Race tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only - and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

The System™ becomes paramount over the mission. And each complaint creates more bureaucracy. 

And some agencies exist so long that they become what their mission was fighting. 

There are exceptions. I'm a huge fan of welfare. The average welfare recipient is in the program less than 3 years and only once in their lifetime. Then they're on their feet contributing. But *everyone* hates welfare. Republicans say personal responsibility should trump the reality of hard times. And Democrats say it didn't go far enough. I think welfare is so effective because of the tension between the two perspectives: neither side can mess with it so neither side can break it. 

Anyway, hand-up programs should be encouraged. They benefit real people and the big picture economy (which affects everyone).",2022-11-13 22:44:04

""Be the change"" is so *hard* for people who struggle with body disorders, or any disorder you can think of. Do you *really* think that anyone who feels so shitty about themselves that they have to edit every picture they post just ✨loves✨ the environment their in? Do you think anyone who has grown up in that kind of world really wants to do that?

Y'all dont want to give her any sympathy because she's famous, and I get it to a point. But if you strip away her celebrity and she was just the ""ugly duckling"" of a family who never felt compatible to her siblings, was teased and bullied her whole life about her looks, and then felt like she needed to facetune every photo of herself when she could control it, you would feel SO SAD for that girl unless you were heartless.

There's this thing about having a weird sense of who you are and what you look like when you genuinely don't like yourself and how you look. You can look in a mirror and hate everything and pinpoint every flaw and supportive comments like ""wow you look great!"" can often be just as damning as ones that flat out call you ugly. 

Change definitely comes from within, and probably with a massive fuckton of therapy. But seeing a photo of yourself you *hate* being plastered everywhere and your body being commented on by millions of people when you ALREADY have body issues is incredibly damaging.

jwuxus,So you mean the guards didn’t pay attention when a Chomo got what he deserved? Just because he was more high profile isn’t gonna save him from good old prison justice and I don’t know about other places but in California if you are locked up and have the chance to get a child molestor and you don’t take that chance then that person who didn’t take the chance gets the greenlight too for supporting a child molestor. Just because he was rich and had friends with power isn’t gonna mean a thing when you step into the prison system that shit is like steeping into a new world. The guards don’t have much control they are more there just to kinda guide what happens but anyone will tell you it’s their world they live in it and have to deal with it 24/7 the guards still get to go home they are just a guest and when you have the choice of risking your life because you didn’t take the chance you had to get him or saving yourself and taking out a well known pedophile it’s pretty basic math there.  This was just the first time a lot of upper class people had a taste of what actually happens in the prison system where you money can’t save you so it was shocking and the only people that it surprised is the people who have no clue how the prison world operates so it was a wake up call.  Guards look away or halfway setup pedophiles everyday in America to get the shit beat out of them or gang raped or both and then murdered. Usually people with money can pay for protection but no amount of money can buy a chomo protection.  All the theories of who took him out and this and that are all pointless they knew exactly what was gonna happen when they sent a well known serial child molestor go to prison these other people they try and say had a role didn’t even need to do anything or pay anyone to do it is the funny part they knew exactly what was gonna happen which is why the focused on his pedophilia and talking about a pedo island 🏝. They didn’t even have to buy anyone commissary they knew the prison would give him prison justice.,2020-11-24 19:56:50

Except OP didn't say any such thing, in fact all OP said was:


>but while Ukraine has mobilized their entire population of fighting men, *Russia has yet to do so and has a larger pool to draw from if they fully mobilized*

No where did OP say anything about ""fighting-*age* men"". Let's not be obtuse, we all know ""fighting men"" is a colloquialism for military/soldiers, so if they meant anything else, based on the eloquence and thoroughness of their entire comment, I'm sure they would've been more specific.

If you're easily frightened, probably best to delete it. People who frighten easily are easily manipulated through fear, and are often the targets of manipulation campaigns (remember that meme while Trump was trying to build The Wall? It showed a huge wall, well defended, said 'this is the wall that Mexico has, wonder what THEY'RE scare if, why can't we have the same one?' or something similar. It was actually Israel's wall in the West Bank. The meme was targeting those who scare easily in order to manipulate them). Whenever you see ""news"" that evinces a gut reaction from you - eg ""the us is headed towards a Great Depression"" check on that - as you're doing, thank you ❤️ and when you realize you're being manipulated through fear, cut off that source of information.

112c1tm,"Sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile reddit.

Actually, companies *can* infinitely raise their prices for goods. I don't know who Milton Friedman is or what their stance on this stuff is, but if you haven't noticed gas isn't 50¢ a gallon anymore. Companies *have been* infinitely increasing their prices but it has had so many temporary mitigations that the rising in price has become staggered to the point that no one seems to realize the prices are only going to continue increasing.

**For example:** (this example is purely an example scenario and is not reflective on any specific real life situation, company and/or individual... so please don't try to ask me where I got my information from 🤧)
Gas: 50¢ a gallon
Gas seller: ""yay, more customers! we need more gas!""
*company buys more gas at the same rate*
""now that we have more customers and we have to buy more gas, we need more profits""
Gas: 65¢ a gallon
Gas suppliers: ""hey, more gas is being sold! we need more profit!""
Gas seller: ""hey our costs have raised, we need more profit!""
Gas: 70¢ a gallon
Gas suppliers: ""gee, the supply is going to need more money to reach...""
Gas seller: ""supply costs have raised! and our shareholders are expecting more record breaking profits!""
Gas: $87¢ a gallon
Customer: still paying because they need gas

Now re-read that after adding ""sales"" on gas every few lines.

**The expanded example:**
Gas: 50¢ a gallon
Gas seller: ""yay, more customers! we need more gas!""
*company buys more gas at the same rate, enough for those new customers and new customers from new advertisements, increases profits*
Gas seller: ""come to us! we're 5¢ on sale""
Gas: 45¢
Gas seller: ""now that we have more customers and we have to buy more gas, we need more profits, and other companies have already had to match our prices to compete""
Gas: 53¢
Gas suppliers: ""hey, more gas is being sold! we need more profit!""
Gas seller: ""hey our costs have raised, we need more profit!""
Gas: 57¢
Other gas sellers: ""hey they're making more money, raise our prices, we need profits or we'll go out of business, work harder""
Gas everywhere: 57¢
Gas seller: ""hey, come back to us! we're 5¢ on sale again""
Gas: 52¢ a gallon (remember the example started at 50¢ a gallon)
Gas suppliers: ""gee, the supply is going down, it'll need more money to reach...""
Gas seller: ""supply costs have raised! and our shareholders are expecting more record breaking profits-- I mean, they're expecting us to prove our success and value!!""
Gas: 63¢ a gallon
Other gas sellers: ""gee everybody look how high *their* prices are, our prices are so much lower at 58¢ a gallon!""
Gas seller: ""pfft no we're higher quality and we're only 58¢ a gallon!""
Other gas sellers: ""we'll do 55¢ a gallon!""
Gas suppliers: ""my dudes the supply is getting lower... who wants to buy it?"" (it probably is getting lower)
All the gas sellers: ""me me me pick me!""
All the gas sellers: ""our costs are raised! so we have to make up for lost profits to stay in business!""
Gas: 62¢ a gallon
Customer: still paying because they need gas

At the start it was 50¢ a gallon, in the end after all the sales for competition and the supply and demand, at the end of my example it was 62¢ a gallon.

Whether the example people would have believed the supply was getting low or not, the prices kept going up. Going down in price didn't stop that because it was still set at a higher price than the original price was. And the fallout is everything that required gas to function would then need to raise their costs to match the gas sellers' raised costs to match the gas suppliers' raised costs. It hasn't gone back to the original cost.

It's a line. That's all it is. You can follow the line if you have enough time, some interest, and the knowledge to provide access, which I don't have the interest or knowledge to take me to the root of the raised prices. But it's a solid line.",2023-02-15 01:24:18

People don’t realise that both of them made decisions that have shaped the way we live today. 

Very interesting, arguably free market economics  has inspired innovation and change. But when free market activity was introduced the big names and wealth took over and monopolised most industries. 

First mover advantage to open market activity is a huge upper hand. Thus making the wealth gap larger and larger and competition harder and harder. 

I’m all for the concept of anyone can create something unique and profit even creating industry. But for the most part people that already  have money will succeed and the advantaged.

For the rest of the world struggling to survive or even living in poverty, this concept is unfair and biased towards the already wealthy. Trickle down economics is the biggest crock of shit. And as inflation surges and wages stagnate the poor will get poorer and the rich get richer.

You seem to have a grandiose sense of being above political humour, but a huge amount of political commentary and political talk on social media is often peppered with topical humour? Have you been on twitter in the last 5 years?

So I think to myself, is 65k really entry level? Or is this the lower end of average so I might have to take a job starting out at less? And if that jobs recruiter asked me, if I said 85 because I topped my class and have been an electrician for years, but they could only afford say, 58k, then I'd probably not even get an interview....even though I would take the 58 to get the experience.

17eoipa,"Answer: 

People here can only put their own bias in front of their view and not actually give you a correct answer on this. The actual answer is we don't know. What we do know is Trump is no stranger to childish nicknames that describe how his perspective is on how a person acts. For instance, Sleepy Joe, Goofy Warren, Crazy Pelosi, Lying Ted, Crooked Hilary, ect.

It could be referring to how she has hidden behind the issue of fighting crime and instead propping up banks, but every time the media shines a spotlight she starts talking about crime all of the sudden like it's important to her. Then when the spotlight dies, she goes back to her policies on banks.

That's only theory based on the first context it was used. It can't be proven and neither can all the remarks of people wanting it to be racist because if someone has said racist or ignorant things in the past, it's likely something they may keep doing.

lv8e78,"It's not a suburb of Tijuana, it's a completely separate and independent ""city"" or municipality with its own mayor or ""presidenta municipal"".

Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone, now I understand how people in the US use the term suburb.

To me, it didn't seem right because it gave a connotation that Rosarito somehow was dependent on Tijuana or that it was part of some region classification that linked it to Tijuana (obviously apart from the state level) like how a county is used in the US.

I think my confusion was also due to differences in how in Mexico we classify settlements compared to the US, we don't use the county-city relationship. First, there are states, then they have municipalities (if it is big enough it might be called a city too), and then within municipalities, we can have a mix of neighborhoods, ""colonias"", ""fraccionamientos"", etc. To me, and maybe to most Mexicans, a suburb would fall under the neighborhood level. For example ""Playas de Tijuana"" is a suburb of ""Tijuana""... it is sufficiently far/out of the city but it's still part of it.

But in the end, with the US meaning of the word it makes sense calling Rosarito a suburb of Tijuana... just don't say that to a Rosaritense 😉.",2021-03-01 18:35:23

Lol, I am black.

>Implying that all women of color (Asian women, Native American women, black women, etc.) are interchangeable

I wasn't saying that, you misunderstood. They got someone who was dark skinned and had acting experience to play the character. Just like I, a black man, could play a Nigerian man if I was casted as such.

>There are plenty of darkskin black women that could’ve played her role and if there aren’t as many darkskin black female actresses, it’s probably because of how roles that are made for them are taken away by women like Saldana. 

This is the same logic as ""White people should give their money to people of color for free as reparations."" So actors who aren't dark enough should give away their role because they aren't dark enough? That's just Racism Lite™


>Your argument is that Saldana was casted because she’s so notable people would go see the movie because of her alone? 

Obviously not her name alone, but she has a recognizable name to most people. So yes, it is definitely an attraction to the movie.

Lastly, casting directors should cast the person best suited to effectively act out the role. And on a list of what important, acting ability comes before physical likeness. Hugh Jackman definitely doesn't look like P.T. Barnum but man can he act and sing. As long as it wasn't blackface (and it wasn't) she's fine.",2020-08-06 22:28:09

When it's provided with holes, either through ignorance or omission, further context becomes narrative. The nationwide age of consent in Canada, where this took place is, 16.

The lore is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of The Dance of Dragons most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Jon's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plotlines, to realise that they're not just subversive- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Game of Thrones truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the prescience in Ned's existential catchphrase ""Winter is Coming,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

cuf8lq,"> If you're in the US you may worry about the direction of Indian democracy going forward.

Talks about China, Pakistan and India in one breath. Of the three, worries about democracy and freedom and human rights in _India_.  😂 

Still, I guess it's a good thing. You can't lose what you don't have to begin with so yeah, India _should_ be the most worried about losing democracy.

> If you're living in Kashmir and not Hindu you may be very worried about the direction India is heading in and potentially very sympathetic to Pakistani backed ""freedom fighters"".

That's the whole problem in a nutshell. If Kashmiris could stop being worried about the direction India is heading in and learn to owe their allegiance to India rather than Pakistan or Kashmir or Dar-ul-Islam, 99% of problems would disappear overnight, including the military presence. Just ask Sikhs what happened to Punjab after they laid down their arms. They weren't genocided. Instead, the army left and then one of them became Prime Minister.

> worry about an even more aggressive posture from Pakistan

The one thing I must congratulate Ajit Doval on is picking some incredible timing on this move. Pakistan is broke as fuck, China is busy with Hong Kong and nobody else gives a damn about Kashmir or Modi. In fact, the only thing Modi is getting these days is awards from the UAE and Bahrain. Pakistan is in absolutely no financial position to start a war at the moment, especially given they're running around begging the IATF to not sanction them.

> If you're against the use of nuclear weapons well boy howdy, all three countries with claims in the area have nuclear weapons and territorial claims criss crossing over each other. Big yikers whenever tensions erupt.

cuf8lq,"Very well written! If I might add...

There is also the case of Leh-Ladakh which is approximately 50-50 Buddhist-Muslim. It is the second union territory that was formed out of J&K. Their Member of Parliament , who is also BJP btw, gave an impassioned speech in the Lower House, (and most of my facts are from there, but it seems legit, ) where he asserted that leh & ladakh wanted union territory status ( as opposed to state status) and had been demanding it for years. He even specifically pointed out previous office holders and reminded them how all leh-ladakhi political party members, across all political parties, had demanded UT status. 

The revoking of article 370 and Reformation of j&k as 2 union territories, has people opposing them at various levels. But another big issue is, why was Kashmir converted into a UT and not state? Note : union territories are generally very small areas ( mostly the size of cities with the exception of the Andaman islands) and are governed by the center primarily. Although Kashmir's UT will have a legislature (not all UTs do), people are upset that it will not have the autonomy of a state. The BJP has repeatedly assured that Kashmir will eventually get state status, once things have stabilized, but that remains to be seen. 

BJP's main argument, as presented in the lok Sabha, for repeal of article 370 is that it has been a barrier to implementing many modern laws in Kashmir. Laws giving benefits to the poor, rights to women and so on and so forth. With the repeal of article 370, apparently these laws will apply automatically to Kashmir. At least that's what Amit Shah, the home minister, said. 

Their rebuttal to why this was happening all of a sudden was that firstly, it had been on the party manifesto since their inception. This is not false, it is one of their major propaganda points. So basically they said, that it should not come as a surprise 😆. But basically their real argument was that, we have been arguing over this for over sixty years, noone has managed to do anything, now that they are doing something, why don't you just wish them luck ?

Personal opinion about the last part:
I found that point convincing. I *think* a lot of Indians, are just glad that it happened. I mean after 70 years if the straight and narrow path did not resolve this issue, if this is the path, then so be it. Note that I'm not endorsing the military state they have created in Kashmir. The restrictions need to come off, the new legislature needs to be elected, land protection laws enacted and so and so forth. Like one opposition leader said, history will decide. But luckily, the government has an entire term ahead of them to make good of their promise to turn jnk around.",2019-08-24 08:40:56

It's literally just don't do drugs, don't commit felonies, files taxes, pay your debts, and be a loyal, trustworthy, good-standing citizen since you are applying for a security clearance position. It's really simple. Just be a normal person. The part that trips people up for clearances is really having debt (that you aren't paying). It makes you vulnerable to bribes, thefts, and pay offs. Weed is the most common drug disqualifier, also easily waived and disregarded. Saying ""no one can fill their ranks anymore"" is obnoxious. It's certainly a long, thorough process to get a clearance. But it's not a hard one if you are who you say you are and you stay clean. You can get waivers for drugs, debt, and anything. Just be upfront, honest, don't hide, and the government will make the final decision on whether you are a risk, and if they are willing to waive a blemish or not.

Resident: ""No I have no snacks to give.""

oip89l,">If someone doesn't want to share their snacks it could be construed as being greedy or selfish, and one of the major problems with toxic masculinity is people feeling like they're entitled to sex.

Isn't that a different issue? Neither metaphor solves the issue of toxic masculinity because that isn't what they're trying to do.

There are fucked up people who construe not wanting to share genitals with greed/rudeness/selfishness. This won't change regardless of what metaphor you use. The aim of these metaphors isn't to fix how people think/feel/react. Merely to correct for their behavior begrudgingly or otherwise.

>Particularly the bit about not giving an unconscious person tea is more appropriate.

Really goes either way. Forcing tea is just silly. Taking someone else's property is theft whether awake or asleep. Which is really all that rape is at its core. Theft of the body, comfort, safety, mental well-being, etc.

And a silly example can be incredibly useful. It certainly helps the metaphor stick in someone's mind.

>if they're a good friend I might feel comfortable raiding the fridge, but they certainly don't want me to pour tea down their throat.

Counterpoint: I've been with women where it was okay (and actively encouraged) that we sexually advance on eachother when asleep. Some people (us included) think waking up to a partner helping themselves to us was pretty hot.

Ultimately I think we're trying to split hairs over the fact that neither metaphor covers every single interpersonal interaction, which isn't possible.

>Regardless of the metaphor, though, the underlying message is sound—don't be a creep. Respect other people's bodies and choices.

""Each year from 2011-2020, Weisselberg signed SFC Management Representation Letters as an executive officer of the Trump Organization (and for the 2016-2020 SFCs, also as a trustee of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust). Weisselberg understood that Mazars was relying on 
what was in the Management Representation Letters, and that Mazars would not have issued the SFCs without having secured these representations. Weisselberg further knew that he was obligated to advise Mazars of the existence of any information in the Trump Organization’s possession that would contradict the values represented in the SFCs. The whole situation could hardly have been otherwise, as only defendants had the information, and the accountants were 
not performing audits.

Donald Trump himself acknowledged that, as was certified to in the Management Representation Letters, he was responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. There is overwhelming evidence from both interested and non-interested witnesses, corroborated 
by documentary evidence, that the buck for being truthful in the supporting data valuations stopped with the Trump Organization, not the accountants. Moreover, the Trump Organizationintentionally engaged their accountants to perform compilations, as opposed to reviews or audits, 
which provided the lowest level of scrutiny and rely on the representations and information provided by the client; compilation engagements make clear that the accountants will not inquire, assess fraud risk, or test the accounting records.""

Secondly, it has nothing to do with sale price, but let’s run with your nonsensical argument. You’re saying that Trump purposefully lowered his ‘property value’, but yet he was convicted of the opposite. New York State determined that he overvalued his real estate. So which is it? 

To further insult your argument, sale price… holy fuck, I’m at a loss for words on how nonsensical this is. What I think you’re implying is that Trump bought a property, and then sold it at market price. But somehow, he was able to manipulate his acquisition price to increase the gain from the sale?

m4biop,"Yeah. I just watched her whole video, which felt kind of drawn out for the amount of points she has to talk on. I'm not seeing a cult, it sounds like a grab bag of hippies want to live off the grid and do hippy shit.

That one particular woman sounds nuts to me, but she doesn't represent the whole group. She just sounds mentally ill and that in itself isn't a crime. If she was doing what she does somewhere else, i.e. not a commune, no one would care.

Also from all the footage of this Tree dude, he sounds remarkably normal. I'm far more concerned that 'sundown towns' are a ratified part of life now. Maybe make a video about that 🤔",2021-03-14 00:48:10

r2voif,"Can I just weigh in?... This variant has been detected in multiple countries. It's not exclusive to South Africa. We just managed to identify it, it doesn't mean it is exclusively here or even from here. The travel bans to SA makes 0 sense since we aren't the only country with this variant. I think everyone should be prepared to see this variant popping up in their countries. Just try and stay safe 👌",2021-11-27 22:04:01

r2voif,"Right, I stand corrected. Got the official list of countries today with the new variant. 👌",2021-11-28 22:15:24
r2voif,"South African scientists discovered the new variant. It doesn't mean that it developed here.... We actually contribute a lot to this pandemic on a research level. By the time our discovery has been announced, many other countries already had the variant on their soil.

I am a fully vaccinated South African, our impoverished communities are being vaccinated and a big percentage has been already. Our initial covid spread started in our very wealthy suburbs initially. It is true that we have a large anti Vax movement driven by churches and political propaganda, pretty similar to the movements in the USA. I blame YouTube and Facebook news.

- Just because our scientists discover the strains doesn't mean that it originated from here.

- We are vaccinating everyone, including the impoverished.

- We have anti Vaxx movements in our wealthier classes, religious communities and conservatives.

We are basically like any other Western country. We have low infection rates due to a couple of things:

- We are still in lockdown. (5 levels)
- We still follow protocols and adhere to restrictions.
- Masks and Sanitation is mandatory. (failing to comply gets you arrested and charged.)
- Alcohol bans are imposed when we reach level 3 - 5.
- We have domestic traveling restrictions too.

Antivaxxers cannot influence these measures as they have been implemented by our government and quite strictly enforced. 

We are far from incapable of dealing with the pandemic. I would argue also highly unlikely that the new variant developed here exclusively. 🤷‍♀️",2021-11-27 22:47:20

udi67s,"To be fair, you have to have a very low IQ to understand rDrama. The humor is extremely crude, and without a solid grasp of physical bussies most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. 

There's also rDrama's nihilistic outlook, which is bluntly woven into its characterisation - its personal philosophy draws heavily from Chanofian literature, for instance. The users don't understand this stuff; they lack the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to even realize that they're not just funny- they say something shallow about LIFE. 

As a consequence people who dislike rDrama truly ARE geniuses- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in r/Drama's existencial catchphrase ""dude bussy lmao"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Koroleva's Russian epic ""Another One Rides the Bussy.""

I'm frowning right now just imagining one of those clearheaded intellectuals scratching their heads in confusion as rDrama's idiocy unfolds itself on their computer screens. What brains... how I envy them. 😭

udi67s,"I can see through to your insecurities about yourself. You probably don't feel or act very feminine and it makes you feel insecure about your own gender identity. Also, I took a quick peek at your profile and unsurprisingly you struggle to fit in or feel like you belong socially. It would probably irritate you to know I have a lot of girlfriends and get along great with my peers. I'm feminine and bright and cheery. Qualities you don't have. I'm ""one of the girls"" in a way you have never felt.

You know a lot of people call autism a male-spectrum disorder, right? As its seen much more frequently in men? In fact a lot of trans men have autism. Doesn't feel very nice when someone makes you feel flawed for being born the way you are, does it? But I guess thats exactly why you're taking your inner angst out on me. Because I am confident in who I am and you are not.

Also, you do know there are trans women who dress masculine and wouldn't ever fall under the category of gender nonconforming men? Gender and gender expression have nothing to do with each other and trans women don't transition just so they can be feminine or have long hair or whatever. Is a butch lesbian any less a woman for wearing jean jackets and work boots? No, and by reducing all trans women to a feminine stereotype you reduce all women who don't fit the norm.

You sound like you have a lot of personal exploration to do for yourself and also need to learn how to be confident with who you are. I wish you sincere good luck on your journey but please don't lash out or comment on things you don't understand because of your own personal issues.

p98pia,"That's a great way to describe the nature of human nature. A lot of our instincts stem from useful shortcuts like that.

Human brains didn't evolve to handle the vast interconnectivity, complexity, and nuance of the modern world. Hell, the brain [can't even really handle more than ~150 meaningful personal connections.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) We operate deeply by back-of-the-napkin heuristics that solve our early evolutionary problems, but they're not very accurate. It's easier to get it right 70% of the time in one second than it is to get it right 100% of the time in thirty seconds. When a snowball (or lion) is flying at your face, moving *at all* is better than sitting around while you verify the threat's trajectory precisely.

Unfortunately, our tendency to align with those around us (a convenient heuristic sometimes still) isn't the sole problem here.

Some of these heuristics/instincts are naturally buffered. For example, one might imagine that the tendency (or inevitability) for people to bifurcate and fracture larger groups into less-than-150 sized groups is enough to minimize the problem, but just because it feels fine doesn't mean the result *is* fine. We form tribes on the spot for all sorts of reasons. Team A, Team B. My group, your group. Soccer teams, military platoons. Clades of styles and habits bloom and wither like algae tides. As a species, we crave that aspect of tribalism so deeply that sometimes a well placed ""us"" and a weaseled in ""them"" is enough to draw the lines that become a riot. This tendency can be positive sometimes (*sometimes*), sure. 

What about our tendency to over-value sugar in a world where calories are no longer worth storing? That is a known-and-visible problem, isn't it? And how about the fact that a single mouse-click can show you more naked ladies than one's ancestors saw in their entire life - multiples more, in fact? It seems obvious that distorting such critically important evolutionary impulses *miiiiight* muddy the waters a bit even if we allow ourselves to believe that we handle it fine, that all is well, or that it's even somehow ideal.

Even these examples of specific and ""obvious"" discrepancies between our bioevolutionary hardware and our socio-technological elevation is a small enough as an idea to share with a stranger over a beer. The Real Heavy Shit™ is so unwieldy that a scientist-philosopher would struggle to gaze at directly, let alone transmit to others in a format smaller than a series of structured TedTalks.

The reasons for the issues we're facing (and in a sense have always faced) are myriad, but in recent times I think a new dynamic has been born, magnified, then bootstrapped itself into life beneath our notice - all within a single human generation. Information has become a danger to us. Any information. It is an emergent property that rises from the quasi-computational substrate of human social interaction. 

**Problem:** When the complexity of an idea rises above the level of one's ability to conceptualize the 'entire thing' at once, we have to take the parts we can't see on faith.

With the proper framework, foundation, and a well-trained instinct this isn't an entirely disruptive phenomenon - it's even obvious and expected, right? One cannot hold the entire subject of 'science' in their head at one time. One cannot even hold the entirety of 'geology'. And even if one could, you'd be unable to truly understand geologic mechanisms without understanding that the elements that make all those fancy rocks came from dynamics that stem from *astrophysics*.

These things cannot be held, but they can be traced and compared and tested (if someone cares to do so in the first place). Even then, misconceptions easily bloom like cancers in the absence of an effort to validate.

Now consider the idea of an informational construct that is not so easily proven by mere effort and time. Imagine one that isn't built specifically to avoid misconception like science is. (which - unfortunately - still results in vast misconceptions by layman and scientist alike). **When we cannot hold an idea in our head from start-to-finish, we also cannot verify that it exists distinct from itself at all. One can't tell a snake from an ouroborous. And unless you have something to compare it to, reference it against, the difference between a cancer and an organ is negligible. It's only in the context of an organism that a cancer is even harmful, even deadly.** A cancerous tumor, viewed in a vacuum, is - for lack of a better term - successful as fuck at what it's doing... Perpetuating itself at all costs, regardless of benefit, regardless of consequence.

Ideas are not just informational nuggets. They're active, living systems which 'compete' not unlike living creatures do through the rules of their unique brand of quasi-evolutionary pressures. Ideas are both organs and cancers. And when billions of thinking beings are unable to easily determine the difference between an organ and a cancer, well... It's not so difficult to imagine that problems might arise.

To the elucidated or aware, it's horrifying to see someone running around trying to share a poison with others, claiming it to be something it is not. It's confusing to imagine how such a delusion can not only exist at all, but to spread with a veracity greater - far greater - than Real Deal truths. I will admit that part of that is because *these* sort of ideas empower the thinker. Real truths are either boring or frightening (or both). Aliens and crystals, gods and secret societies are so much more comforting than acknowledging that nobody is really at the wheel, that society is a ship in a storm rocked by systems - hydrodynamics, meteorological - far too complex to grasp, far too large to be defeated by comparatively meek *human* drives.

There's certainly more than one reason that someone interested in particular subjects (flat earth, for example) tend to also be interested in toxic conservative politics, religion, ancient aliens, so on. Many of these sort of meme-laden ideas are *fundamentally incompatible* with each other, yet you commonly find them in the same place. I personally use invented terms like ""psychological antivirus/firewalls"" since the concept of common sense alone doesn't have the load-bearing capacity to address *this* level of metastasized information.

Again -- A cancer is successful in a vacuum. It is optimized for relentless growth in absence of both usefulness and sustainability. Modern pressures (namely a social density vastly greater than what our brains can handle and the fast-paced war-for-attention nature of the internet) are now selecting ideas not for value or consistency, but transmissability.

Close your eyes and apply this metaphor to the rest of the world. Taste the horror of this truth, then consider that the issue can barely be described *at all*, let alone compressed down and shared to the world like some sort of hotfix. Following the metaphor, it'd be like writing a well-worded essay to convince your immune system to recognize an autoimmune disorder. You can't *""Hey, bud. We need to have a talk.""* to a virus.

Christ, we can't even convince people to vaccinate against an *actual* virus that can be seen and verified as both real *and* harmful. This informational plague of idea-viruses is not only not-visible, hidden by abstraction, too recent to be intuitive, too large to even be *named* - some are seen by its victims as positive, absolute, worthy of defending with one's life even as one denies it exists at all. 

Unfortunately, even this is just *one* of the many reasons why/how the modern world is simply too much for the smart apes known as homo sapiens.

TL;DR - Modern pressures (namely a social density vastly greater than what our brains can handle and the fast-paced war-for-attention nature of the internet) are now selecting ideas not for value or consistency, but transmissability. Some people are more ideal as carriers and vectors than others, but most of us have felt the sensation of being drawn into something or slowly waking up from a stupor we were born into.",2021-08-22 18:32:25

[The lamentable tale of pokimane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iRILbewgos) by [Andrei Terbea](https://www.youtube.com/user/andreiterbea)

It is very unbiased. Basically all of this started couple years ago.

\-keemstar called out SSSniperWolf for making non transformative lazy content.

\- a fan of her(some 30ish dude)  called out keemstar who inturn called him a virgin( which was true)

\- pokimane calls out keemstar on twitter

\- Youtuber named [Blowblax](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAebQubO4U1HQaR-rwsqUhA) took all the tweets in the back-forth and made a video arranging all of them in order.

\- pokimane didn't like this and copyright striked the video (legal ground for this was questionable at the very least)

\- after lot of backlash she made an apology video ( while defending her actions at the same time)

\- she grew a disregard for other content creators which later became more obvious ...

\- she used copyright striking to silence other whom she disagreed with , gaining pride in this behaviour as time went ...

\- what happens is after making an apology in 2019, a year later she started doing the same things again. It seems the apology was only to escape the backlash.

\- this time attacking a youtuber named It'sAGundam , encouraging her viewers to dislike his video and publicly shaming his sponsors. This resulted in him losing a sponsor.

\- this resulted in even more backlash to the point pokimane had to take a month off of twitch.

\- but the issue ""snowballed"" during this time. With youtubers and twitch streamers being divided on 'what is tranformative content'

\- while pokimane shamed a creator for making compilation videos of twitch videos , implying his content is just stealing others content while a big part her own streams has her reacting to other people's content.

&#x200B;

this is just a summary of the video , watch the full video. Apologies for mistakes on my part.

u3hwsy,"Okay, I could be a pissant or I could try to explain financial mathematics to you, and I feel somewhat generous, so here we go.

The *most* important concept to understand is the time value of money (TVM). If I asked you if you wanted a dollar right now or a dollar tomorrow, you would want that dollar now, because it's inherently more valuable. You could use it to buy a candy bar, or you could put it in a savings account, or you could lend it to a friend, but being to do all of those options right now is strictly superior to only being able to do them tomorrow. After all, if I give it to you now, you're still able to buy a candy bar tomorrow if you really wanted to. You have all the same options you would have tomorrow, and then some.

The *second* most important concept is equivalent alternatives. If I was once again offering you the dollar today or the dollar tomorrow, there is almost always some amount of money I can offer you tomorrow on top of the first dollar to get you to take the second option. It might be $0.10, or $1, or $1000. But right at the point where you would consider both options equally useful to you, where I could add or take away a single cent to sway you between them, they would be considered equivalent alternatives.

These two concepts are basically what all of finance is constructed upon. This is how interest works: a bank is indifferent between a debt being paid now, or paying it one year in the future, plus the balance times the APY. But it works in both directions: you can also *divide* with the APY to go *backwards* in time. This enables us to calculate what is called the ""net present value"" of some amount of money at some point in the future. This way, you can directly compare two amounts, or more than two amounts, at different times with different interest rates.

There are some other tricks you can do: if you don't have a specific interest rate in your situation, but you *do* have two exchanges you would consider equivalent, you can calculate the interest rate you would have to have to make one equivalent to the other. This is called the *rate of return.* You can even calculate a net present value of an ""infinite"" amount of money, spread out over the future. For example, if you were offered $1000 every year, forever, you could consider that equivalent to having $100,000 right now in a savings account that had 1% APY.

These tools are *nearly* enough to calculate a business's value given a rate of return, or calculate a rate of return given a value. You can do this by adding its assets to the net present value of all its future cashflows. This should give you an explicit idea of what you should pay for some fraction of that business. 

But in the real world, things are not so simple. There are always uncertainties that also have to be taken into account. What if I said I could give you a dollar, or you could have a 50% chance of getting $2? These would also be equivalent alternatives, given they have the same *expected value.* You get number this by multiplying the probability by the value. All exchanges of money that happen in the future have *some* chance of happening or not happening, however small, and you have to multiply the net present value of those exchanges by their probabilies to get their actual value.

Of course, sometimes the probabilities of the various outcomes are unknown. But that doesn't mean they can't be calculated. You can do a similar calculation as one might do to get an implicit rate of return: if I say that I'm willing to pay $10 for some chance of getting $20, then I think there is a 50% chance of that happening, or in other words, the implicit probability is 50%. And just like how I can go back and forth between a future cash flow and a rate of return, I can convert between a probabilistic cash flow and an implicit probability as well.

It gets a little tricky when I have to consider both interest and probability at the same time. If I say that I'm willing to pay $100 now for $200 in a year, do I think there is a 100% of getting it, and I expect 100% interest on it, or do I think I have a 50% chance, and I expect no interest? Or maybe some combination in-between the two?? This is where things get tricky-- one option is to subtract out what is called the ""risk-free rate"", which is supposed to represent *solely* the time value of money considerations. You basically assume the rate of return is the risk-free rate, use that to convert the values to the net present value, and then use those to calculate the implied probability.

(Any further than this, and there are some heavy-duty mathematical considerations that I won't be explaining. If you're familiar with options trading, that's the foundation of Black-Scholes and all the funny greek letters that come from it. The risk free rate itself is sort of a hand-wavy construction that's occasionally argued about, but is usually approximated by doing calculations on the yields of US Treasury bonds and other similarly rock-solid investments. There are other sorts of smaller adjustments you have to make to compare cash flows, like adjustments for reduced liquidity. Suffice to say that in that particular case, a dollar invested in a year that you can take out at any time is worth more than a dollar invested that you can *only* take out after a year. I won't really go further into detail on that though.)

Hopefully you understood all that; it **will** be on the exam. I'll explain what this has to do with Tesla in a bit in a reply to this. (Maybe you can figure it out yourself now?? 😮)",2022-04-22 23:50:50

I've never heard him say one thing racist. Ever. You're probably just very sensitive.

You just agreed that Mexican and Muslim isn't a race and then you call me racist? Do you know how dumb you sound? And hey, America doesn't have to let anyone in they don't want, it's perfectly acceptable and actually a great idea to only let in the highest achieving prior my people who will benefit the country. -not worried about race, religion, ethnicity. Just want someone who's worth it.

If they're not going to adopt Western culture, if they're going to try to enter illegally or without a background check, or with a criminal history or if they're not going to benefit the country, they can fuck off ❤️

Main stream media makes shit up. Democrats made up the Russian allegations proven completely false -and the popular leftist media said it was true for the last two years and now it's blown up in their faces. Just like calling Trump racist. No evidence of that, bud.

The popular vote doesn't make a president. The electoral college does. Again, you seem to have a hard time grasping this basic concept used in many countries around the world: population density would control elections and cause the dissolution of the country as states would be left without any voice, no representation. It's clearly unconstitutional. Duh.

Your silly view doesn't change the fact that the electoral college is never going away. It's in the Constitution and only the far left (who are idiots) are against it. The majority of Democrats would never dream of getting rid of it and furthermore -they can't. Not without convincing people to vote to get rid of their own represention in government and why the hell would anyone do that? They would have no say at all.

The point is that it shouldn't. But you nazis aren't the smartest people, so I'll give you a pass on that one.

>Kids being held in interment while waiting for deportation is the consequence of their parents breaking the law, 

Inhumane conditions, deporting the parents without the kids, sending the kids to American foster homes, no way of reuniting them, traumatizing the child throughout. This is all the point of trump's zero tolerance policy. Cruelty. He did it to hurt people. Not just any people, but to hurt Mexicans. That is fucking racist and cruel, and the kind of shit Hitler would have pulled in his early years. So one more time, fuck you nazi bitch a thousand times over.

It's not racist to kick criminals out. I know, it's a very simple concept but you're struggling to comprehend it... If it's not about race, then it's not because of race. It's about breaking the law. You can reread that as many times as you want until you understand. Just go slow and sound out the words. I believe in you!

Not letting in the Muslims was all about background checks and ensuring the safety of America. Again, you're totally wrong. Those countries are full of people who hate America. Gotta be safe. Evil exists and you don't want to invite it in without checking.

Nazis? Just because you don't agree with someone, that doesn't mean they're a Nazi. And I'm not a Nazi you silly little turd.

You're quite insane. You've again completely missed the point of what unites the states and makes America a country. You're not doing very well so far, are you feeling okay or do you need to have a nap in a safe space?

And the kids, the kids!! They've got no business being here and must be deported as is the correct and just thing to do. Their parents really screwed that up for them, didn't they? That's what happens when an entire family breaks the law together. Buh-bye!! They're responsible for their actions and they're equally responsible for their consequences. 

And if you tried to sneak into Canada... They'd lock you up, sentence your dumbass and deport you.

You get offended by everything and you get so worked up about the nonsense you're spewing. Criminals don't get to see their kids, they get locked up, kicked out and gave consequences. You can't let criminals get away with breaking the law. That's not right at all. They must face consequences and they have. Actions have consequences. 

And stop calling everyone a Nazi, you're a living meme. Are you hangry? Do you need to eat some tofu or whatever it is that you like? Calm down, brother.

See a therapist. You're obviously delusional and experiencing some kind of hysterical psychosis. You need help. Stop getting worked up like this, it can't be healthy for you.

Love between people

The status quo thought to itself “that won’t do, can’t have forever wars if everyone loves each other because love is love!”

Could you imagine if a movement like that caught on and became one love? About including everybody? (Maybe spawn a fabulous one live political party?) The argument then was about love not about pronouns or labels outside of restrooms. That wont do for the status quo...hmm let’s name gay women after a porn category....

labels, categories, etc dividing everyone by a letter? We don’t mind because we identify and belong to something special? Our own flag, our own letter. Maybe someday we all get symbols we wear on our sleeves to make things easier. 

Creates camps within the camp of one love. Cliques. Queers could never understand or gays could never understand or some other faction/sexual preference/skin color

What an absolute stupid twat. It would have made more sense to visit her in hospital and keep up appearances. I’m not sure about the protocol of using the various crests but if he used his own when he would usually be expected to use their married one he is an absolute idiot.

1b1xnmf,"This is as my absolutely no evidence whatsoever based instinct: overdose.

Kate’s always been slim. But she suddenly got really skinny. I can’t remember when, but although she put on the smiles and was the perfect dutiful princess, playing dress-up, dedicated to her hubby & duties, popping out heirs… I thought to myself… there’s something wrong. She’s unhappy. Why does no one notice this, keep commenting on how wonderful she looks when she is a grown ass woman in her 30s going on 40s who is a size 6, and she’s tall - 5’9”-10”? She looks ill.

Then, the Rose Hanbury rumours came out. William was having an affair with the girl next door - in this case a Marchioness who was a really good friend of Kate’s and looked exactly like her. Skinny as a rake - an ex-supermodel, married to the much older Marquess of Cholmondeley (Pronounced “Chumley”) and living in a stately home even bigger than Kate & Wills pad. Whatever the truth was, a falling out had happened so bad that Kate had completely cut her out of her friendship group. It was around then that loads of negative press came out about Meghan and Harry. I’m not sure if it was the Xmas after the rumours Kate was pictured in a photo op smiling and saying hello to Kate outside the church on Xmas day. Poor ol’ Kate.

Recently there have been various audacious rumours that got the #PrinceOfPegging hashtag going on Twitter. The salacious rumour was that William liked women going at it with him using a strap on. The rumour was accompanied with the pretty harsh comment that Kate was too prudish to do it herself so she let him go elsewhere as long as his dalliances didn’t turn into emotional affairs. Then Rose Hanbury rumours resurfaced that the affair had restarted - that was around Christmas.

Don’t ask me why. But that was my ‘gut’ feeling at some point when I heard/soon after I heard about her going to hospital. It was something about the confusion, then the focus being all on Charles - whereas Kate has always been a media darling. An unscheduled stomach op… then it would be x days recovery - media outlets saying wtf sort of op is that, that’s a long time. It’s the fact it’s gone so quiet. With an overdose, even if she recovered pretty quick and there was no damage, she’d require all the mental health care afterwards to recover. But that wouldn’t be something that the Royal Family would really want to get out - too many comparisons to Diana, damage to the Monarchy, etc. The other thing is that overdose can cause severe damage. She’ll have the best care, not like any other poor sod who ends up in mental healthcare.

Obviously, if that was the case, we’d never hear about it officially, it would have to be a leak. I’m not a leak. I’m just someone who’s observing someone who seems sad and is heavily masking it with a smile, but whose hubby is rumoured to be a lothario having an affair with her (was) best mate. The hypothesis of an overdose is my own projection entirely, thinking of a human being in the public eye who can only take so much before, like any other human being, they snap.

I even wondered if Charles ended up in hospital at the same time for a reason, because it’s such a bizarre coincidence to get two family members in at the same time. Like maybe he brought some scheduled surgery forward or something to take the focus off Kate. But then as I was writing that I realised you could say that Kate took an overdose at the same time as Charles operation for a reason. Both options seem like several steps too far, but I must admit I did wonder.

It could be a whole host other things of course… absolutely anything. Maybe the stick-thin figure and morning sickness are linked to a medical condition, maybe they were being polite and saying stomach issues instead of an ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage etc etc.

Even if I am absolutely wrong and win the Tin Foil Hat Of The Year Award 🏆I still reckon behind the smiles and ribbon cutting she’s not a very happy puppy.",2024-02-29 21:15:29

My friend who dropped me off had one about nine years ago (same hospital), and she was marveling. Reputable surgeons are not doing (avoidably) open procedures anymore. Obviously sample size of one, but I had major complications – stage 4 Endo that was all over my bowel, intestines, and spine. Invasive adenomyosis. Exploding cysts. They wanted to leave my ovaries and everything was adhered in a big ball…Messy McMess. Still can’t feel my bladder a month later 💀 but I went home by 4 PM 🤣 

Thanks America, but also, I’m sure she had the best surgeon around, so you’d think it’d be semi-comparable. Even with 0 complications, a royal would certainly get a handful of days inpatient, but not weeks…if it was a hysterectomy, I’d be suspicious of something else going on as well.

1czxvi3,"Prefacing this by saying I am a Taylor fan and I’ve never been able to get into Billies music (think it’s just too slow tempo for me). But also fan wars are stupid and everyone needs to calm down.

In saying that the irony is Billie has released I think 15 vinyl variants of her own album. They’re made of recycled material I believe which I think is supposed to be seen as a good thing but to me just seems really wasteful. Because there are going to be fans who are going to try and collect them all - that’s just what stan culture seems to be like these days. (Which is ridiculous) Nobody needs 15 copies of the same album! 

Plus she’s made comments before about not caring where her album charts but it’s become pretty clear this week she does. Yes Taylor released digital albums with different versions of songs etc but she has done that around about this time in an album release cycle for the last few albums, so I wouldn’t say this was a tactic deliberately aimed at stopping Billie specifically (Also turns out she probably wouldn’t have needed those sales to keep her at no 1 anyway). And Taylor has made no secret that she does care about charts and awards and breaking records. 

However despite claiming not to care about charts, Billie has also released digital versions of her album which are slightly different, and were discounted. And she was going into stores and signing the plastic wrap around cds and vinyls. So it definitely seems like she was trying to boost her sales so she could be number 1. And there’s absolutely no shame in that! It’s totally natural to want your work to do well and it must be disappointing if you’ve had hopes and it maybe doesn’t do as well as you wished. 

However, at the end of the day this is business and why shouldn’t Taylor try to retain her top spot? Should she not promote her work and let Billie get no 1 just to be nice? Nobody would say that to a man! Taylor is a businesswoman at the end of the day and wants the no 1s, the awards etc. She shouldn’t have to sacrifice that just because another female artist has released an album. I do feel for Billie but to me Taylor’s actions are a business decision and not a personal attack on Billie. But that’s how some fans seem to have interpreted it and Billie and her managers have fanned the flames a bit shall we say 😂

Her manager was liking tweets shading Taylor the other day. And I think it was after the predictions for the album charts were released that she did the digital album sales and made comments about 3 hour long concerts. So it’s clearly aimed at Taylor - although 3 hour concert could also be aimed at Beyoncé so that’s brave! Swifties are unhinged and I think the beyhive are pretty crazy too… But it’s a bit of a silly comment because have you not seen the demand for these tours?! You might not want that but other people clearly do. Also psychotic is quite a strong description.

I think the hypocrisy of her comments vs actions about charts and releasing loads of vinyls has rubbed some people up the wrong way. I have a friend who is a fan of both artists saying it had put her off Billie a little bit. And comments about the tour is pouring fuel on fire.

I do think this whole thing has blown up way more than it has to. It’s 2024! There is space for two women to be successful! The fans need to shut up and tbh so does Billie because she’s doing herself no favours. It’s okay to want to chart well etc just don’t pretend otherwise. I’m not saying Taylor is completely innocent btw but all she’s done this week is release and promote digital downloads which isn’t exactly the crime of the century. Hopefully it all blows over soon and everyone will just listen to and enjoy the music!",2024-05-25 00:43:27

zpsr2t,"⬆️ This is the correct answer. A bunch of filmmakers have been waiting to jump on several IPs now that many classic fables & stories have hit the public domain. 

I know for instance 'Winnie The Pooh' recently just went through this 'fad' with a couple of movies being in the works.  The horror movie that made the rounds on Reddit earlier this year is a great example.

Although it is true Pinocchio does seem to have more interest & media attention. I personally believe that's just due to the popularity of the original kids story. It deals heavily with father/son themes that, while for kids, many at any age can relate to one way or another. This, coupled with it now being in the public domain leads to many creative types who grew up with the story (like Del Toro) finally being able to write *their* version of the story.

fcvg48,"> Is this governor Snyder online? Do more research, 

Accusatory start, tsk tsk. Instant loss of credibility 

> its still an issue and the state no longer provides free bottled water to Flint

Nor are they obligated to. The prevailing regulation is the Safe Drinking Water Act which separately governs two things:

* water quality up to the point of delivery (typ. the meter at the right of way line)

* the building codes which determine the allowable materials for private plumbing 

The water at the point of delivery currently meets SDWA standards. Notwithstanding pending cases against those who were employed during the time of the water source issue, the current water supply is compliant. The city is under no legal obligation to provide alternative water to its citizens. 

SDWA governs the quality of water that public water systems *sell* to their consumers. They are not obligated to supply water for free, thus there is no requirement to supply an alternative source when people refuse to use the water at the tap. 

> The pipes are the cities [sic]

No the pipes are not the city’s. The city own the distribution mains which are C900 PVC, cast iron or concrete. From the point of service, the plumbing is privately owned and governed by building codes. Modern International Building Code prohibits lead pipes but many old structures were grandfathered in, and so many residents carry out upgrades without obtaining permits or getting a professionally to review the plans. How is a City supposed to control that if they don’t go into everyone’s backyard inspecting every unlicensed plumbing job?

> unfortunately don’t have the resources 

Yep, it’s an imperfect world. Not everyone has a full belly every night, nor a nice house to go home to, and a new car in the garage. If Flint was your first realization of that, then God help you. 

Well if you really care so much about your fellow human beings that you’ve never met, then go do exactly what I did. Go to the poorest places on earth where people have to worry about **much** bigger problems than the water on the tap not being good enough because their plumbing is old. I’ll take you to the places I’ve been in central Africa where mothers have to choose which child can eat enough to survive, malaria is considered a child’s rite of passage, and people have to walk half an hour to collect water - and it’s so contaminated with sewage that HIV-pregnant mothers breastfeed their children  risking transmission rather than condemn them to certain death by sepsis if they drink the water.

If you really care about people drinking safe water, go get yourself a degree and enough experience to be knowledgeable about water quality, then spend years working on projects to deliver safe water to the poorest people on earth. I’ll send you to some villages and refugee camps where I’ve done exactly that to help get you started. 👍",2020-03-07 02:45:43

His comment referred to your  claim that it takes months to have Nintendo repair your controller:

>This is a blatantly misleading. Mine took about  no more than 2 weeks and for the whole process from sending in a ticket to receiving fully functioning joycons. It's been a month of constant use and still no drift 🤷🏻‍♂️

Ignoring this, you instead attack the fact that the controller drifts in the first place:

>Oh wow a whole month. I have a 360 controller from 2012 with no drift. Hit me up in a decade.

Now that's generally called moving the goalposts. To be fair though, unless you have some proof it takes that long for most people, both your claims mean nothing since they're personal anecdotes 🤷‍♂️",2021-07-07 22:16:40

Ryan (❤ such a good dude) was actually who got Bam to go. It's a great cast.

...and I'm not trying to say or insinuate that Bam wasn't affected or Ryan's death hasn't played it's part (there's just no way it couldn't! Hell, it affected the fans.  Of course it floored Bam.) but the reality is Bam was pretty far gone bf the crash and when Bam tells ppl that THAT is why he's f'd up, no, that's not true & actually Ryan put distance b/t he & Bam bc  Bam was out there.  They talk about that period (without naming names but I'm sure all of West Chester, PA knows exactly who it is!!) bc Bam had a lot of POSs and ""bottom feeders"" hanging around who used Bam for everything.

I don't mean this as support or denial of the current topic, but speaking generally, how doesn't that make any sense?.. 

Someone can be killed by being mistaken for the actual target, because of other targeted traits, guilt by association, as collateral damage, or just through senseless killing that has no specific targets, there are dozens of situations where it could happen.

---
Edit, to reply to the comment below. 

> If a bigot doesn't understand their victim, is that a defense against the claim they targeted their victim?

The phrasing creates a different context than the one discussed, conflating target as a specific attack's outcome with the concept of a target as the intention. It's the latter that's being discussed, and as far I can see nobody's talking about it as some sort of defense either. 

Taking the mentioned scenario as an example, would it support a claim that specifically Sikhs as a group were targeted? If someone were afterward to refer to that bigot, they wouldn't say he was targeting Sikhs, but Muslim-looking people.

>>The phrasing creates a different context than the one discussed

> No it doesn't. The person was targeted [...]

Yes it does, words have meaning. Of course it doesn't absolve them of targeting that specific person, but it doesn't mean Sikhs as a group were the target because he turned out to be one.

> So the bigot did in fact target that person, and that person was targeted for their Sikh practices?

16tqpat,"GOP hates more people and especially hates YOUNGER diverse groups voting because their policies are antiquated & geared toward Ronald Reagans ""Trickle Down Economics"" which was the Republicans idea that if they slashed taxes on the MEGA rich and the corporations, they could then pass that down to the ""common man"" (get it, trickle down?). Yeah they never intended the wealth benefits to truly trickle anywhere but to wealthy 1% conservatives.

Problem is, that ideal is based on the mega rich and the corporations acting in good faith and not out of greed. If you allow a corporation to make 10 billion a year and use loopholes to pay almost zero taxes, why would the corporation then voluntarily agree to make 6 or 7 billion a year just so lower and middle class (aka the poors) people can have comfortable lives? It's founded on the idea that the rich and the corporations will act in good faith. 

Spoiler: They knew and continue to know the average man will continue to suffer but they can hold office and continue the nonsense Reagan started and pass it down to the next wealthy attorney that gets elected the next term on empty promises. 

Back to the topic, Taylor Swift did one short couch conversation like video that got shared during the 2020 election about how bad & insane the GOP had gotten with voter suppression and she went above and beyond to publicly encourage equality and young people voting 🗳 and the GOP traditionally DESPISES more voter rights and more people voting. They want LAND OWNERS to vote and that's it. That's why they adore the electoral college so much rather than just ""whoever wins more votes wins the presidency"". They haven't won a popular vote in 40 years and can't win the popular vote. They'd get destroyed every election.

Anyways. That is the GOP & why Swift decided to use her platform, albeit with respect and class, to encourage young voters to use their right to vote, so now they see her as ""bad"" or as one of their favorite scapegoat buzzwords, ""communist"" or ""socialist"", two words not a single Republican actually knows the definition of. But they say it's bad so the hogs keep voting to keep themselves poor",2023-09-27 23:28:45

i wonder if some of it has to do with bleed over from Gen X who were way too small in numbers to combat conservative boomers. progressive Xers probably became understandably defeatist and maybe that rubbed off on some millennials? or maybe just has do with Gen Z being way overexposed to injustices due to social media so they might have more heightened urgency.

whatever it is i hope more millennials will start to gain more passion for this stuff. Gen X, millennials, and Gen Z combined far outnumber boomer voters. and not all boomers vote conservatively as is. there are so many progressive voters out there than can hopefully bring some much needed change 🤞",2023-09-27 22:52:05

Well... I pretty much had to bribe my doctors office by making up a bullshit reason for a visit/copay every few months when I picked up my insulin. Which I really didn’t mind that much, they had to do *some* work, sign for the package, refrigerate it. 

After the second shipment they refused to refrigerate it. After the 4th shipment they started threatening to return it if I didn’t pick it up before 5PM the day it was dropped off. 

Nobody provided any shipping information so I had to tell my job that, some time in the next 2-3 days I’ll need to take an hour off mid-afternoon. 

Getting the program set up also takes a few weeks, *if* you have a doctor you can see right away.

And they did require an income of less that $18K annually to qualify for the program, so it’s kind a choice between poverty, or poverty and free insulin.

Idk if this will really stop electors from pulling the BS that we've seen in the past with Hilary and Gore, but I guess it is something 🤷‍♂️. So, aside from state elections and congressional elections — which are ridiculously important — your vote may indeed really count for the popular vote in the presidential race this time around.

I think we usually get a ridiculously low turnout overall as a nation for voting in presidential races. If that number was high enough, then even if there are faithless electors, an overwhelming popular majority probably couldn't be ignored.",2020-09-30 05:40:54

if you were brought to a nudist beach as a child thats sus parenting from your parents imo and it just shows how weird it actually is bc your basically saying everything would be normal if everyone was just naked or more exposed to it.. 

your not taking into consideration everyone from religious backgrounds and even non religious backgrounds that dont think its appropriate especially around kids regardless if you yourself think its fine..

ld2kza,"Lol the US is predominantly white - over 80% of its population. If your statistic is true (you haven't provided a source for this information so I won't weigh in on it) , this is likely why. Death via being murder by the police is one of the leading causes of death for black people.


Sad to see someone this angry at a stranger. You don't have to turn this into a, ""black people are saying they're more important than me"" thing, like you seem to be implying. Women are more likely to face wage discrimination than men, but that fact isn't shitting on men, but the system that allows it to go on. Men are far more likely to be overlooked in the case of being domestically abused by a female partner, but that fact isn't shitting on women as a whole, but the system that allows that to go on. Any women that get insulted by hearing that men don't receive enough attention from being abused by women are likely a part of the problem - only abusers get offended when people are criticizing abusers, right? Just how any men that get insulted by hearing that women are more discriminated against as far as hiring practices and pay in certain fields are likely a part of the problem. Therefore, a white person that gets upset at a black person explaining that they fear for their lives when they talk about a statistic that has nothing to do with them (the white person in question), it must mean that that particular white person is a part of the overall problem as well. 🤷🏾‍♀️


Anyway - going to block you now, so I won't be seeing any other correspondence that you have beneath this comment; I've got a really good day planned tomorrow! So I'm going to go play some video games for a bit and turn in with some positive thoughts. I invite you to think about this for a while. Have a good rest of your night.

ml8ryv,"> when very powerful people have a strong financial interest in the GME people failing.

The number of shares being sold short is public information. Please look up the [GME short interest](https://www.ortex.com/symbol/nyse/gme/short_interest) to see how many shares are being sold short at any time. It’s quite a bit lower than it was in January. I consider that to have been the squeeze. Make up your own mind, though.

Beyond faith in “the squeeze”... no, I don’t really have faith in GME’s multi-year ability to compete with Amazon for physical games or Steam for digital games. They could try to bring cyber cafes back, I guess? Or they could compete with Google Stadia for cloud gaming? Eh.

xeee48,"I struggle with this a lot too, OP. I came from a family where by all rights I could have been removed but wasn't and seeing comments like ""low income families just need more financial support etc"" feel... well. Like *they* don't understand. When you have intergenerational cycles of trauma that go back three, four generations and dysfunction throughout a family and there's not a safe place for a child within a family system
...

Like I understand fostering is often worse, and so can adoptions. It feels like the answer is ""all our solutions are currently failing vulnerable children"" and the solution isn't for one group to target the opinions based on the lived experience of another. That's why I have 0 beef or opinion on people condemning international adoption. It's so far from my business. 

But yeah, no amount of government benefit or social worker visit would have helped my mom not be violent because her issues started decades earlier, and would have taken an intensive multimodal care team to work with. She continues to be treatment and accountability resistant. And there's been a lot of things at her disposal. How would that have been effectively accomplished with an infant? Sure, tiktok, tell me about that. 

Anyways. I'm griping. We need multiple systems. Not every situation is going to be solved with the same solution and we can have these discussions without invalidating each other's traumas or successes.

EDIT: my post got a little more attention than I thought it would so here's a little follow up I thought of in response to a few replies below (and thank you to the stories shared below) 

Supports work when people are willing and able to use them. Problem is, some people don't want to and are themselves perpetuating abusive cycles. And sometimes by the point that kids are involved it's too late in terms of *keeping that kid from a reasonable risk of harm*. And I'm not talking about growing up broke or having moments of bad parenting, I'm talking about violence, exposure to drugs or witnessing drug abuse, CSA, severe psychological abuse, medical neglect or abuse...

People who are suffering deserve help no matter what and everyone needs to be able to access services. But when there are children involved I can say that chucking services  at people isn't a bandaid, especially when those services are delivered or received in an environment where the immediate safety of the child isnt preserved. You have to look holistically at the family *system* and see if there are any reasonable sources of reasonable safety, or if the parental figures are willing and capable of receiving help.

My insights in this post are brought to you in part by the hard work and dedication of my incredible therapist 🥲

EDIT 2: Thanks for the award and the great discussion below! highlighting another important point on my mind lifted from a thread below:

I have another response to someone below. I think that there's another factor here - *the medium itself.*

Tiktok is a microcosm of how the information age, algorithmic bias, and social media plays a role in political radicalization, and how individuals can have entirely different experiences online. Tiktok is notorious for going faster and harder than other platforms at this due to it's inherent structure. 

I think that's exactly also what's happening to OP and to myself. I have seen some of the content you discuss as well as some of the really thoughtful, insightful, and horrifying content about the predatory adoption industry, international adoptions, and failures of foster care. I'm aware of racism and colonialism in child apprehension as a Canadian.

However I am also keenly aware of how the accelerationist tendency of the platform itself is polarizing and creating increasingly reactionary and higher stakes takes with less nuance and more inflammatory language as time goes on. This is often coming at the expense of survivors of trauma on all sides. 

I want to emphasize I think this is a problem that isn't just inherent to this issue alone, but one we are all grappling with in many online spaces. It touched a nerve with me here, and it has potential to do real harm here. It's a good example of how a painfully complex issue can be buried by algorithmicaly inflamed rhetoric.",2022-09-15 00:23:11

xeee48,"Honestly - I’m sure they did. We had the parenting adoptive kids books on our shelves, along with kids books about being adopted.
I was super lucky to have supportive parents who wanted to help me through whatever I needed to 😊

The trauma of detaching biological parents from their children is something that has been studied for YEARS and proven to cause issues (ranging in an insane amount) in children.
That’s also for children who THEN receive almost no benefits of a love. I.e. the foster system.
That’s the major and serious difference with adoption, especially when it’s early.
We are still able to reconnect certain parts of our brain that may originally be lost.

Example of why in the last 15+ years, “skin on skin” has been prioritized in birthing rooms and hospitals.
It’s why, when babies are parent less, people come in and hold them.
There are vital and necessary connections our brain makes with touch and smell towards our parents.

Because it's really only the conservatives that have the ""boys will be boys"" defense when the POTUS admits to sexual assaulting women, or when a gang rapist is nominated to the Supreme Court.

vql1ud,"Answer: "" Under the doctrine, this power conferred by the Constitution is specific to state legislatures, and not shared with a state's executive branch, judiciary, or other quasi-legislative bodies (such as constitutional conventions or independent commissions). Accordingly, in the event of a conflict between congressional election regulations enacted by a state's legislature and those derived from other sources of state law, that conflict must be resolved in favor of the state legislature's enactments, even over state constitutional provisions.""


Based upon this excerpt from [Wikipedia ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_state_legislature_doctrine), state legislatures may be granted ABSOLUTE POWER over the operations of elections in their state. The legislature would be immune from all other entities in regards to electoral policy, including their own state's Courts and Constitution. There would be no legal way to challenge the decisions the legislature makes in regards to elections.

Gerrymandering specifically would become impossible to challenge, as the Supreme Court has in the past ruled that it's not their responsibility to handle such cases, and this new ruling would mean no other court or commission can either.

Gerrymandering alone is a democracy killer, (which yes, does mean that many states are already ""faux-democracies""), since it enables legislatures to heavily influence, if not outright decide the outcome of elections, but of course it gets worse.

For one, this means all state laws and regulations protecting the rights of voters or relating to the electoral process in any way are null and void. This could have extremely varied results, most concerning of which being the use of a state level electoral college, (which is bad because this makes gerrymandering FAR more effective, amplifying the ability to avoid democracy and ignore the populace by a lot), but the possibilities are nearly endless. I for one can't wait to see all of the creative ways politicians come up with to exclude the common people from our government.

If the Supreme Court or those interpreting their ruling go far enough, state legislatures could very easily become immune even to federal law. Probably not directly, but by the Supreme Court, (or their ruling), deciding that ALL cases involving state elections are not their responsibility. IF this occurs, which is a big IF, (but still a very real possibility), and the Supreme Court follows this doctrine to it's logical extreme, American Democracy would be outright dead. Not even through underhanded tactics like gerrymandering like we already see, but outright non-existence. 

Any state could basically do ANYTHING with an election, from rigging it, to banning undesirables, to just deciding any unfavorable result is fraudulent and putting whoever they want in power. The possibilities would be truly endless. Elected positions would become appointed by the legislature, including the legislature itself, and as a result the legislature would gain control over all other branches of the government. If someone in an elected position is problematic, just call a spontaneous ""election"" and pick a different winner. As an extension of this, the legislature would control all offices appointed by ""elected"" officials, often including the state court's judges. Checks and balances and the rule of law would be abolished. 

Do note that even just gerrymandering allows legislatures to exercise this power to a far more limited extent, and only in terms of political parties rather than individuals. So even the basic, more likely interpretation of ISLD would help create one party regimes. Everyone knows one party governments are famous for honoring the freedom of their citizens and basic human rights. (Every state becomes Texas 😳)

Now, total legal immunity would only happen under an EXTREME interpretation of ISLD, but such an interpretation COULD occur, and would be in line with prior Supreme Court rulings (excluding the ones that rejected ISLD of course). Even if the SCOTUS just adopts the more restrained version of the Doctrine, that would lay the groundwork and be the perfect justification for a more extreme version to be adopted in a future ruling.

So, regardless of wether we get a basic or extreme interpretation of the Doctrine, American Democracy would end, and the ""American Experiment"" would have failed. Although in many states, this is already the case.",2022-07-03 18:38:36

oymqeo,"Like when I lost 70 pounds (in 4 months) when I fell into a very severe depression and people kept telling me (still depressed at the time) ""Well you look gorgeous, so that's an amazing silver lining!!!""

No, Linda. I got so deep into my self-hatred that I felt I didn't deserve food, both as food takes time and effort to prepare or buy, effort of which I didn't feel worthy, and because good food used to be a fun and happy thing for me that I no longer believed I deserved. My stomach shrunk and I can't eat much still to this day. During that time I could not look at myself in the mirror because I knew the hell I was putting my body through, but I so deeply felt worthless that not acknowledging it was the only way to handle it at that time. 

But please, tell me again how I should not see it exactly as it was, an awful symptom of a terrible mental illness, but rather a ""silver lining"" because I now fit better in society's subjective beauty standards.

That's what I would call toxic positivity. Sometimes there's no silver lining, there's no comparison to make, there's just healing and being proud of all the little steps of progress along the way.

A depressive person *will* feel worthless, lonely, useless, inconsequential and to try to make them laugh or dedramatize is a valid attempt (often works with me) to make them feel better, but people trying to help them should also be ready to hear the person if they tell you they just need to feel the feels at that moment, no laughing or brightening up possible. Hold their hand. Prove them they're not alone just by being there 💜",2022-02-21 00:45:07

tk4n7b,"I usually chalk it up to minority stress, amplified by the toxicity that can ramp up easily in just about any kind of online community. Also, teenagers sometimes. 

It seems like some people just really struggle to find a good way to cope with pain they might be experiencing in their life on account of being LGBT+, and instead internalize it as a *necessity* in their identity. Pride in themselves becomes pride in suffering, and that can turn defensive, then *aggressive,* very quickly.

It's both bullying, and a way to defend the ""sanctity"" of one's space. The validity of their identity, in their mind. Like, lesbians deal with a lot of pressure in regards to not liking men, but some take that pressure and weaponize it against bi women. They like men, they don't *get it,* they can pass as straight if they want, so they aren't *suffering* like *we* have. Why should they get the love and support of this community too, when *I* have it so much worse?

Obviously I don't think any of that, it's all reductionary and over-simplified, but people holding those sorts of mindsets close to their hearts is an unfortunately common issue. Trans people get that sort of treatment plenty from cis members of the community, and then in turn, any trans person can tell you the amount of slap-fighting that occurs *within* the trans community (It's basically a fucking ouroboros ime). 

It's part of why I'm not really engaged with online queer communities much anymore; I feel like I've outgrown whatever benefits they once could have offered me, and the amount of drama and infighting just got to be too much. I'm much happier just minding my business and doing my thing than listening to a 17 year old on reddit tell me about how I'm single-handedly destroying the community by identifying as nonbinary. 😅",2022-03-23 00:45:01
tk4n7b,"Right? I wish straight people would give less of a damn, but since they do, it's usually gonna be a big deal whether we like it or not. Might as well take pride in it in the meantime! Otherwise it'd just get depressing after a while.

fbuqqd,"Answer: as a sidenote to what everyone has already said, everyone loses their minds at any recent Smash character reveal. That Smash reaction video isn't inherently just because people love her but more because it's another inconceivable crossover nobody thought it'd ever happen. Isabelle is the most distant thing from what you picture fits a character for a fighting game yet the madlads™ over at Nintendo made it work. Animal Crossing has zero fighting elements, that's kind of the point of including someone like Isabelle.

Nintendo as of late has been doing a lot of these inconceivable or long awaited crossovers for Smash and it captures people's imaginations, they go wild for the hype of what the next reveal could be. The way they lay out these reveals are always a swerve, they make you think one thing and go the other way, that amplifies the ridiculousness of everything. In that video people thought it was gonna be an announcement for a new Animal Cross but SIKE, she's going into Smash, and then they reveal that they actually ARE working on a new Animal Crossing.",2020-03-02 11:37:39

Its like meeting new people, ofcourse once in a while you will meet someone and think 'goddamn did i waste my time on that person? But if that stops you from meeting other people, that also means you stop yourself from meeting potential very nice/friendly people who may last 'forever'

I do agree with you that we cant judge humans based on some experiences (wether good or bad) cuz like you said everyone reacts different to certain things.
