88ll08,"The News™ is a business. 

Because there have been reporters who have done fantastic jobs in the past (and as some still do), made real and important changes to our society, doesn't mean that everyone who uses the title of ""journalist"" or anything related to that is somehow exempt from critical judgement or can use the shield of free speech to conduct their business. 

Distribution of information lives in the same capitalist ecosystem as every grocery chain, appliance company, local plumber, etc and has the same goals as most - survive and be profitable.

No matter their political lean, don't just get hooked onto whatever they're putting out. Consider all sides but have some reservation about what you accept.",2018-04-01 16:08:01

artkmz,"Let me tell you Youtube also supports absolute shitheads like PeluchinEntertainment, who has murdered and tortured animals on camera and uploaded it. 

But i get what you’re saying here. My little sister has a youtube channel where she uploaded one “gymastics challenge” video, and I monitor her channel and look at the analytics with YT Studio and stuff. Analytics show that the most common searched thing to find her video was “gimnastika skirt” and I searched that for myself, because I knew damn well theres only one person looking for that stuff *pedophiles* . I go on to find a bunch of “gymnastics challenge” videos from little girls and gross comment sections full of weird pedos, like goodness gracious.

Hope Youtube resolves this issue and gets their act together.

ay4nxh,"My grandma died of pancreatic cancer when I was 12. She was so healthy in every regard, even doing 5k run/walks and such in her wary seventies when she was diagnosed. My grandpa was the one who had a slew of health problems and we thought she would outlive him by 20 years. I remember she found out she might have cancer and her telling my mom, “I just hope it isn’t that pancreatic cancer. They say that one is the hardest to beat.” It was. She only lived about two months after that and had a horrid final month.

Such a nasty disease. 😢 I wish Alex Trebek either an unbelievable recovery or a more comfortable end of days than my grandma. ",2019-03-07 00:59:39

7p69uk,Wow. She was clearly upset but she was not at all out of line. What a bunch of assholes 😤,2018-01-09 15:09:30
7p69uk,"Interestingly enough, one year ago today I shared this status on Facebook:

“Teachers' hefty salaries are driving up taxes, and they only work 9 or 10 months a year! It's time we put thing in perspective and pay them for what they do - babysit! We can get that for minimum wage. That's right. Let's give them $3.00 an hour and only the hours they worked; not any of that silly planning time, or any time they spend before or after school. That ...would be $19.50 a day (7:45 to......... 3:00 PM with 45 min. off for lunch and plan-- that equals 6 1/2 hours). Each parent should pay $19.50 a day for these teachers to baby-sit their children. Now how many students do they teach in a day...maybe 30? So that's $19.50 x 30 = $585.00 a day. However, remember they only work 180 days a year!!! I am not going to pay them for any vacations. LET'S SEE.... That's $585 X 180= $105,300 per year. (Hold on! My calculator needs new batteries).What about those special education teachers and the ones with Master's degrees? Well, we could pay them minimum wage ($7.75), and just to be fair, round it off to $8.00 an hour. That would be $8 X 6 1/2 hours X 30 children X 180 days = $280,800 per year. Wait a minute -- there's something wrong here! There sure is!

The average teacher's salary (nation wide) is $50,000. $50,000/180 days = $277.77/per day/30 students=$9.25/6.5 hours = $1.42 per hour per student--a very inexpensive baby-sitter and they even EDUCATE your kids!) WHAT A DEAL!!!!

Heaven forbid we take into account highly qualified teachers or NCLB...

Make a teacher smile; re-post this to show appreciation ♥ all you out there!”",2018-01-09 15:42:16

6g0yt4,"My grandfather had this tradition of getting all of his granddaughters diamond earrings when they graduated high school. He passed away a year before I graduated, and before I was heading to my graduation, my family called me upstairs as I was putting on a bracelet he had engraved with my name years before, so that he could be with me on that day. I went upstairs and everyone was sitting in the living room, and my aunt gave me a bag and I opened the card with everyone watching. The card read, ""Hey darlin', congratulations on your big day. I'm sorry I couldn't be there, but I hope you dawn these bobbles and think of me. Love, Grandpa Irv"" all in his shaky handwriting. They were diamond earrings, and the date he wrote the card was exactly one year prior, which was weird because we didn't even know the date of my graduation a year before. My aunt told me that the trip to get those was his last trip out of the house before he was too sick to go on. I sat there crying my eyes out and knew he was there. I still have the earrings and I still cry thinking about that. It's been 10 years. I am sure this boy will remember this moment forever. ❤️",2017-06-08 19:47:34
6g0yt4,Sup all my other people that clicked on that notification 👋🏻,2022-06-08 19:03:44
6g0yt4,"This made my heart feel good and sad at the same time. The power and gift of music is an amazing thing, I've been playing guitar since I was 8, so that makes it 14 years as of now, so, I know the joy of getting new gear as a surprise, however, I'm clueless how it must feel to receive it from someone you've lost. I can see it in his face, he's going to have that guitar and that card for the rest of his life. I'm truly sorry for his and his family's loss. I'll be praying for them (I am a Christian, and I don't bring that up to disrespect anyone or their beliefs.) And if he has a Reddit or a YouTube channel that anyone knows about, I'd like to see him play. As an odd side note. When I was 16, I looked EXACTLY like the kid does. I mean, exactly. Same nose, eyebrows, hair, hair color, and from what I can see, an almost identical face. Like you wouldn't be able to tell us apart if younger me stood next to him. So, my mind is blown on top of everything else. I'll update later after I show this to the family, Fiancée, and her family, and everyone freaks out. Sending good vibes to the kid and I hope he shreds on that guitar 😊",2017-06-08 21:12:27
6g0yt4,"I was about the same age when me and my dad went together to buy my first real guitar from the music store. Up until then, I just had a little cheap acoustic for made for kids. Solid guitar, but not the greatest. We picked out a beautiful purple Ibanez acoustic, which to this day is my favorite guitar. A couple months later we went back for my first electric 😂. I can't imagine doing any of that without my dad. He really inspired me to pursue learning to play. I have nothing but the deepest respect and sympathy for young Johnny. My deepest condolences, my friend. I wish the best for you brother Johnny. I hope I see you melting faces someday. \m/",2017-06-08 18:32:02

Now all this material stuff doesn't make me happy - although you've never seen anything like that boat of mine. No, it's my new brain that makes me happy. My new brain that is powerful, explosive, and a real competitor. Now I know some of you redditors might be thinking ""Ok solid, you're full of bologna sausage!""

862l6x,"I know you say that in jest but I fall into that category, at least in spirit. For a 6th grade UIL competition we were supposed to create a structure out of spaghetti and glue to see which could hold the most weight. Among the rules were that no power tools could be used and no parents could be involved. I was a very advanced reader at the time for my age so I did mountains of research about load bearing structures, tensile strength, adhesives, and the like. I designed and built it with the best I could come up with, testing which spaghetti brands were strongest and eventually making my own from scratch. I did the same with the glue. I did the entirety of the work for my team. Then, at the competition, we placed 4th, right out of the reach of a 🏅. Not because our structure was bad, it actually held more weight than I thought it would. What upset me was that the ones who placed above us had obvious help. Each of the top three had a swarm of parents with them continuously hovering the projects. The winner had a group of parents drop off his pasta structure from the back of a truck. They used industrial grade adhesives that had alphanumeric names, ones a sixth grader would have no access to. The designs were extremely complex and obviously required mountains of time and labor that, frankly, surpassed what a sixth grader could pull off. That may sound like just a bitter assumption but what sealed it is when the students gave the presentations, they obviously had no idea what they were talking about! They didn’t know about the design of the structure, the adhesives, how they came up with the design, nothing! I had a moment of satisfaction because I thought for sure they would get disqualified since they were obviously just along for the ride. But of course, they won it all. When the winners were announced, the parents were all high fiving themselves, not even paying attention to the students who supposedly did all the work. I was dumbfounded. I quit UIL and never went back to any of those kinds of competitions during school because of how bitter it made me. ",2018-03-21 18:08:31

Naturally, the 2018 E400 Sedan continues the tradition of E-Class brilliance. Harmonizing advanced automotive intelligence with awe-inspiring interior design, its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips — even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence.

Driver Assistance Systems — including Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC®, Active Steering Assist and Active Lane Change Assist — feature intelligent cruise control: They help keep you between the lines, and can even help you shift between them. Inside, the E-Class cabin provides an environment of pure comfort and responsive technology.

7ae860,"For most real but BARE minimum (like no permits rng) productions that low end would likely be at least $5K and an actual full on production would probably be multi day and likely in the $50K+ range. And that definitely doesn’t include edit. I know you allowed for more than $10K, but I’m expanding on it for others to get it. Just camera rental for a few days would eat the low end budget and even if you own it you should be charging for it.

You’ve got director, DP, AC, an aerial crew, cam and support equipment rentals, DIT, G&E, light rentals, producer, PAs, and crafty. You could have a smaller crew but this is probably the minimum that would be budgeted for. That’s about $500-$1500 each, and some of those are multiple person departments and I’m probably forgetting someone. Yep. HMU (hair and makeup).

Then you’ve got to have places for people to go to the bathroom and eat, talent, permits, road closings, professional drivers, location/tech scouts, script writing, concepts, boards, and a bunch of other pre-production work. And you might even need a process trailer for shooting some of that safely.

Plus this looks like a lot of shots were done using natural light at golden hour so it’d definitely be multi-day for the exteriors. Maybe you do that for a day or two and you use a minimum crew, cutting lighting or whatever.

If an actual company does this by the book, it would cost way more than even $10K. The edit and grade on a serious commercial would eat that budget alone. Say you take it to The Mill to color. That alone would be about $1000/hr.

Can you do it for less? Certainly. This guy did. But if you get a full crew out there to shoot it like you’d do for a commercial spot that’s going to air, it’s going to be at least that $10K budget and they’re cutting corners for sure if that’s including edit. $5-10K per day is a good baseline for a small general shoot that doesn’t include cars driving.

I’ve done a car shoot that was pretty ridiculous in the timing (we needed more days), with a small crew. Some of the crew, including the director and one of the producers, were paid by the client so their costs weren’t even in the budget. It was three spots shot in three days. Very run and gun. IIRC, the budget was $40K and that had half days for lighting and didn’t include the edits/grade. I think they were another $10K but I don’t recall. And that was cutting corners and cutting costs.

But if you really want to know why film budgets are so high, here’s a good example: I bought basically a dark piece of glass yesterday that’s 4x5.65 inches. It cost $400. And I got two other pieces of glass on a huge discount that together still cost $400. I spent $800 for half a square foot of glass. But hey, unless I break them they should last me around forever so there’s that. 🤣",2017-11-03 13:58:52

7ae860,"This meme doesnt get old, kind of like the styling of the Mercedes Benz E-class Sedan, the most intelligent E-Class family of all time welcomes a powerful new member to the dynasty.
The E400 Sedan model arrives this year, boasting a 3.0L V6 biturbo engine producing 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque — the same powertrain that currently drives its E400 Coupe, Cabriolet and 4MATIC Wagon cousins. Paired with the 9-G-TRONIC 9-Speed automatic transmission and DYNAMIC SELECT, it promises a bracingly smooth way to experience uncommon luxury. Naturally, the 2018 E400 Sedan continues the tradition of E-Class brilliance. Harmonizing advanced automotive intelligence with awe-inspiring interior design, its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips — even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence. ""Car-to-X"" Communication enables the E-Class to exchange information with similarly equipped vehicles — effectively allowing it to ""see"" around corners and through obstacles to detect potential hazards. Driver Assistance Systems — including Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC®, Active Steering Assist and Active Lane Change Assist — feature intelligent cruise control: They help keep you between the lines, and can even help you shift between them. Inside, the E-Class cabin provides an environment of pure comfort and responsive technology. Flowing lines and vibrant screens provide a striking visual display, while touch controls, aromatherapy and tailored seats indulge all of your senses at once.

I would be pissed if I was pulled over for nothing but going under the speed limit 😂Acting like if i went over i wouldn't also get potentially pulled over. 

Very bizarre that the cop argued well make sure to not go under the speed limit. Like it’s called the speed limit right? And you pull people over for going over it right? I so thought get the logic. It’s not significantly slower than the speed limit or anything that could be dangerous to other drivers in that sense",2020-06-11 15:00:43

✅Car isn't (black) driver's 

✅Bullshit reason to pull over 

✅(Black) driver getting agitated by interrogation for unknown reason. 

✅⭐⭐⭐ Agitated **BLACK MALE** exiting overdue rental car and approaching police officer!  

❌ Suspect carrying handheld video, possibly live streaming event.

ada3xr,"⚠️ Warning: I ended up just rambling about my small town I grew up in. Don’t expect riveting content. 

I lived in a town of like 10,000 and it was still very small, like we had two gas stations, a grocery store, a liquor store, and a few restaraunts. Oh yeah, two bars, a thrift shop, a karate dojo, and a laundry mat.  

I think I listed literally every business there. 10,000 people is a pretty tiny town.  We didn’t even have a fast food restaurant. 

500 is minuscule. Our town and four others all shared one high school that had about 1000 students. All of the towns were nestled up next to each other but still fairly separate and small. Ours was sort of the odd one out, we had a cool national park, but besides that it was sort of a retirement community. 

That being said, I had an awesome childhood there, and now that I live in a big city, I think a small town in a nice area with good schools is the best place to raise a kid. We were on the bay and therefore very close to the beach which allowed for all kinds of shenanigans playing with canoes and kayaks and mud. My friends and I knew every nook and cranny of our little town and would bike around getting into adventures on the daily. 

Once kids moved out of their parents house they’d either go to the town with the high school because it was super touristy and had good beaches, or the actual city 20 minutes away with a population of like 50,000 (but wayyyy more businesses). ",2019-01-07 03:47:07

fn7gj6,"Please don’t go. Say you go to work and don’t get it. Okay. But at what cost? PTSD? Unmanageable stress? Daily fear and anxiety? Say you go to work and do get it. Pass it on to your family. Is the job worth it? If you get fired, try to collect unemployment. Dude I feel you. Your life is worth more than this job. There are thousands of other jobs. There are NOT thousands of other dads for your kids to help them grow up. 

I’m in the same boat. I just LITERALLY TODAY called my work and said sorry, I’m not coming in anymore. I work in healthcare for special needs individuals. I also am the primary caretaker for my elderly grandfather with congestive heart failure. One of the patients I care for has a fever. Another has a horrible cough. We have to work. They’re saying it’s mandatory that we wear masks and gloves. I just got off of a 14 hour shift and I can’t do it anymore. My grandfather cannot get sick. Family comes first and I can’t keep spreading illnesses back and forth. I love my patients so much. But I know if I go back my pap will eventually get sick from me if I get sick. There will be plenty of workers to take my place. I have only one grandfather to tell me he loves me. 

I’m sorry for the long reply. What I’m saying here is that basically, fuck employers. They DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. They care about continuing to profit right now so their stocks don’t keep plummeting by the billions. Stay home and keep yourself and your family safe. Im doing the same right now. My employer didn’t even respond. They hung up on me when I told them. They could care less. All the hours I spent wiping tears from my patients, hugging them, playing with them, caring for them, I’ll cherish it forever. My employer just cares that I worked myself to the bone so they could get rich. I wish you happiness and health. Please be safe. Much love. ❤️

So one day her moms church friend comes over and my moms plant is going wild so she brings her up to my moms room to show off her green thumb.

Well my dad needed me to order him something online (he's the most computer illiterate person I know, so this wasn't super uncommon). Well right around the same time I ordered my bridal lingerie. The lingerie was delivered before his order. The day it was delivered, I come home and the box is very crudely taped back up. I knew what it was and  figured what happened. Thinking it was hilarious I find my dad and asked him if he opened up my box. His face turned beet red and before even answering me yells at my mom in the other room ""I told you not to tell her what happened!"" He then proceeded to bumble and back peddle.

I'm on this drug by the way. it has no side effects at all and you'd have to eat a whole bottle to overdose. It's generic with no patent, so iits cheap.. it was originally made for malera, then approved for lupis and rhmeutoid arthritis. now it's approved for off lable COORONA virus use, 
in the first US clinic trial with 80 infected patients it had a 97.5% cure rate. one purson died but they were 86 and brought in with advance stages of the disease. one person had to go to the icu for unrelated complications. 

the other 78 people were cured. the success rate was so high the doctor in charge didn't use a second double-blind study because this treatment was so successful he said it would have been unethical to use anything else on the other group. It is a legitmate cure. I take it for lupus (autoimmune disease) the mechanism of how it works is identical to the way it happens to kill COVID-19...  if you have questions you can ask ... I know everything about this drug i've been on it forever. also it's like $0.04 cent a pill i pay $1.38 for thirty 200mg pills which is a months supply of it at the pharmacy out of pocket.  I've got bottles of the stuff laying everywhere,,,,and i like biology and pharmacology.. ive read a lot about how and why it is effective.. but it's a lot of typing lol.

> The drugs — which are used to treat malaria and other conditions — have been called game changers by President Donald Trump.

The FDA limited the scope of its authorization to drugs supplied from the Strategic National Stockpile.

> Since the global pandemic of COVID-19 began, scientists and clinicians have rushed to understand and mitigate the threat, while sharing with other researchers what they know. Academic journals have already taken steps to accelerate the flow of peer-reviewed information by expediting editorial and peer review for coronavirus-related manuscripts and granting them open-access status upon publication.
> 
> “This coronavirus outbreak has led to a real surge on top of what we usually receive,” says Edward Campion, the executive editor of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), who says the journal is receiving up to 40 coronarvirus-related submissions per day. He says the journal’s expert virologists “have been willing to review papers under very short turnarounds, sometimes less than 24 hours.”

> I’m getting probably ten to twenty review requests a week. Before the outbreak, I was sticking to mostly four to six coronavirus papers per month.

IF you're home and isolated, the chances are less of contracting the virus this NOT overwhelming the hospital system. If you decide to goto the hospital/UCC for a broken ankle/knee or whatever, now there has to be staff that has to take care of you instead of focusing on the important things like covid. You also risk yourself getting covid because of going to the hospital. 


I've been dealing with so many patients who doesn't think it's that bad and walks in because they have knee or hip pain from 4 months ago. 🤨😤


Now they may or may not do emergency surgery depending on your condition but that surgery would waste precious resources the medical staffs will need to use to deal with covid. So you're actually putting medical staffs at risk. If we all get sick, who would take care of the patients?

So I live in Southern California not too far from Los Angeles, 10 mins away from my city is a little “hidden area” where a lot of celebrities live... including Reese Witherspoon. So this guy came in (from that area) and asked how our day was, then said “Better than that actress who was found murdered this morning” all of my co-workers were shocked and asked what actress??

8qo7li,"I met Jon Hamm in a small boutique bar in Hollywood. I never go to bars like that but I was driving home a friend from the local rollerskating rink. So we are hanging out in this dimly lit bar, I’m sitting at the bar and my eyes are hurting from the lack of light so I take off my glasses and I rub my eyes. All of the sudden a man sits down next to me and says, “what’re ya drinkin?” I reply, “ vodka soda.” To which he responds,” same as me, what are the chances?” That was when I recognized the voice and turned to see Jon Hamm staring at me. So we started up a conversation, light subject matter, verrrrry casual. Then he invited me and my friend to dance, so we started dancing, all 6-8 of us. Fast forward to the end of the night it’s all hugs and goodbyes. I hop in an uber home and wake up early the next day, feeling as you do when you spend a night out drinking. I rinse my face and go to put on my glasses 👓 and I can’t find them anywhere. So I look and look and look some more, nothing. Now I’m not a detective per se, but I’m fairly certain my glasses are sitting on some shelf in Jon Hamm’s house with a small placard that reads “vodka soda”, and I’m honestly fine with that.

For RH Traders that own $GME that money, as best I can tell,  is held in street name.  Which means that 30% APR goes 100pct to 
@RobinhoodApp
 😬😬😬.  Imagine if you pooled your crypto and the platform was getting 30% APY and didnt pay all but fees to you ? What would happen ?

> Mark Cuban
This is one more way that Wall St takes advantage of the little guy. If you are moving from RH, look to see if you can find some place that allows you to hold the shares and lend them in YOUR name, so you get the Yield (Yield Farming in stocks !). Not all will allow it.

> Mark Cuban
But if they do, one trick that I have been on both sides of is to lend out stock to shorts at a high APY and then call back my shares, which forces the short to cover. Now if #WSB did this en masse, it would be the mother of all short squeezes

l8m69d,😂💎🖐🚀,2021-01-30 21:28:06
l8m69d,"Exactly! I almost mentioned it in that post. That’s why I was so good. I just had so much genuine belief that it was a good deal. I felt like I was doing these people and families a favor. Plus I love people so I would just let them chat and talk about all kinds of stuff then try to go over the product. I didn’t realize it at the time but it was an amazing strategy for sales. I had this one old dude, I sat with him for an hour and a half and just listening to his life story. After a while I was like shit I’m so sorry but I have to tell you about this because I know they are staring at me wondering what’s taking so long (mgrs started standing in front of my window looking in like every few minutes) This guy pulls a card out his wallet and says “honey, anything you’re selling I’m buying” I was like oh no it’s $12,000 let’s at least try to go over it. He wouldn’t let me and I went out got my takeover and he was out the door. 

As much as it was an awful place I don’t regret my time there. I just learned so much about people and got a lot of life lessons. The biggest one is your income does not matter the more you make the more you spend. I had old ladies w no income and living on SSI pulling hundred dollar bills out of their bra.

The company was called World Connections Travel. It wasn’t even deeded real estate like it is in Florida where you need a real estate license to sell. In Georgia it was basically like vacation ownership you just get weeks and you exchange them through RCI and other exchange companies. You’re basically selling them air you’re selling them nothing. After moving to Florida I got my real estate license and I assumed here it would be more legitimate. It wasn’t.

And they didn’t hide it from us, I was just seriously stupid and naïve. Once I realized what was going on I could look back and see where I should’ve seen the red flags. We even had Clark Howard raid the place about a week before I started working there. He’s one of those radio finance guys and had heard about the scams and people we screwed over. I should’ve known then right from the start when I heard about that. I don’t know what I was thinking 🙄",2021-01-30 19:57:49
l8m69d,"I’m glad you had the integrity to say fuck that. But def not a career option of you don’t like talking to strangers lol 

Yeah, I really fucking love sales and I think I’d still be good at it. I would love to find a company that I could work for and really believed in. I tried for a few years to find some thing then gave up and went into even dirtier work, corrections 🙄 now that is some unethical work lol I definitely prided myself on being one of the good ones but you see so much shit. Everything I would report would just get swept under the rug. I’m very bitter with law enforcement because of my time there

Although now as an RN I am disgusted by fellow nurses and wonder how they chose this path if they don’t care about the patients, so I guess the lesson here is there are shit people everywhere and every career. Yay",2021-01-30 20:26:45

5yeefj,"🤔🤔🤔 Why does this shock people? Everytime confidential files are declassified we get to see more and more proof that our government has been spying on us and commiting horrible crimes against U.S. Citizens. Snowden wasn't the first case of proof just the largest spotlight shone on this stuff. If you still believe it's just a conspiracy theory, I challenge to do some research. It's available and not from nut job websites but through government sites. My personal belief is due to America becoming more and more of a melting pot, and more religions sowing roots here, they needed a new format of control over the masses. There is no stronger, proven way to control man better than control of his Fear. If the fear of eternal damnation no longer works what's the next best thing. The fear that our leadership is betraying us. Man will go to great lengths to avoid fear, to the point you can literally give them documented proof and believing it scares them so much they not only write it off but completely tune themselves out from the facts. So they ignore it and choose to chase the carrot while being whipped from behind, subconsciously convincing themselves there is no master with a whip, but that they are chasing the carrot by free will.

d2slb2,"I remember reading about that a few days after 9/11. Many thousands of Americans waiting in London and the UK, unable to fly home due to the flights being grounded. Being afraid. Wondering if we were going to war and who did it...

Imagine coming to the palace, trying to distract yourself from the fear and despair sitting on your heart. Feeling alone even with your friends and family so far from home. 

And then they do that. They know your pain. You've been hugged by the mother country.  Torn away in war and revolution, but brought back in solidarity as a peer, an ally, and a friend. 

In the moment you aren't alone. 

That's why I love the UK.  They truly are special friends whose relationship with us can't truly be matched and is truly unique. 🇺🇸♥️🇬🇧",2019-09-11 21:55:05

Oh, looked it up again. Octopus has Greek roots, but people use Latin to pluralize it. It's octopuses or octopodes.  That's why octopi is wrong. You shouldn't follow Latin rules for a word that has Greek origin. Even if auto correct doesn't fix this and people that don't know about this debate won't correct you. ",2017-11-08 22:18:08

f0q0ao,"Few random musings:

1. I like how he lights up a smoke with a Zippo lighter when she starts her rant. I can imagine the hand picking up the lighter had too many rings and bracelets on it. (5:10)

2. She left POOP in the bed after a party?? I can only imagine what kind of party that was (15:10)

3. She used to be a stripper? Didn’t know that until now. 

4. Johnny’s rant (24:27) about her not being there is 👌",2020-02-09 01:31:01
f0q0ao,Jesus what a psycho!! 😱,2020-02-08 14:11:48
f0q0ao,"But, she’s hot 🤷‍♂️",2020-02-08 14:55:19
f0q0ao,"Yeah she doesn't literally say ""I did it"" in this audio.

She says ""No one would believe I [description of how she could have faked injuries which happens to line up with related statements and evidence that she may have faked it]""

Objectivity is key. But quite frankly if some of y'all were truly interested in objectivity outside of when it backs your bias, maybe more questions could have been asked up front rather than blindly taking her word for everything for years despite obvious inconsistencies.

More pointedly, the complete lack of objectivity towards Depp is exactly how we got here. So I'm torn between agreeing with y'all wholeheartedly that objectivity is sorely needed or calling out you and everyone else sanctimoniously demanding it now in defense of someone who, by all accounts but her own (and to some degree *including* her own), is a truly awful human being.

I hope y'all had this same unyielding desire for the Objective™ truth when the claims first started flying but why do I doubt that was the case? If I'm wrong, awesome. Keep that energy. Question everything.

f0q0ao,"I guess people don't like that I called him creepy? 🤷🏻‍♀️ He always looks dirty and strung out to me, but that doesn't make him an abuser. Or maybe because I believed Amber Heard? Lady had videos, pictures, etc. - she was really deep into the lie and knew she was deceiving the public. She is the reason people don't believe women who are actually abuse victims.",2020-02-08 22:30:08

Jeezus H. Christ on a console! Way to antogonize your fanbase! Maybe Blizzard might want to reconsider other markets besides China? Besides that, the ads for it when I'm on my old, *Walkr* ""Mom"" game to earn free energy cubes, look like shit.

d7clba,"When I was a runaway teenager, I stayed in a house that had no a/c. It had been stolen off the house, apparently. Since this was Phoenix, AZ in the summer, it was horribly hot inside the house. The guy who owned the place had a pug dog that knew how to open the fridge, get inside and then close the door. The fridge was broken, so the main part stayed around 70° and the freezer stayed cold enough to store food. (So just nowhere for frozen stuff). It was so hilarious the first time I saw the dog do it. When he was done sleeping he just pushed the door open and got out on his own. 😂",2019-09-21 20:06:48

a9t4d2,"If you find yourself getting heat sores in the folds of the skin in summer or simply abscesses, talk to your doctor and see if you can partially cover the cost by insurance as medically necessary. I had a customer who went from 500 lbs to just under 200 and he was explaining this to me. It still ended up costing him about $7000 to remove the front section, his ""apron"" as he called it, but he also said it was worth it. 

I have the same due to having twins. I wish it was covered, as well as a breast lift from feeding 3 kids, but 'tis life (literally, lol). Good luck, and I wish you the best ❤ ",2018-12-27 03:36:29

One of the girls, for intimidation, smashes a (probably soda) can on her head and crumples it to the floor. Eric, nonplussed, attempts the same - and knocks himself out; to which his friend follows up with ""You need to empty the can first.""

6mrr1a,"Aight here's the deal, I don't really care too much on the topic. Why? Because my life is at a point where I have enough problems to face on a daily basis, and l refuse to devote energy into this one. That being said, I think it's a good thing some people do care very much about it. But saying this is my agenda is incorrect. This issue will affect me whether either way it goes, but it's not my agenda because I simply do not make it an issue. I am prepared to accept things whichever way the ball rolls. In fact, I'm pretty sure there are many people like me who simply do not give a damn whether this affects them or not. 

Bringing it up to people is completely fine, having discussions - perfectly okay. But when you start pushing the matter down people's throats even though they clearly expressed a disinterest. It's time to stop ✋. Not everyone feels the same way as you nor do they want to. The importance of net neutrality is not equal to everyone. That being said I don't know how you actually talk to the people in your life, so I'm not judging you. But the way I took your initial post is that you're encouraging people to just shove the issue down everyone's throats and that is not okay. ",2017-07-12 15:16:40

7qsqvg,Am I the only one who read his book Modern Romance? The book was pretty good in imo. It’s actually almost the epitome of this whole date/sexual encounter. 🤔🤔,2018-01-16 17:19:29
7qsqvg,"Cw. Extensive talk about consent/sexual assault. There’s also a TL;DR at the end if this is a lot for you but you want the gist. 

I think we’re at a point in The Discourse™️ where we’re being made painfully aware of the friction between two camps: those that are primarily concerned with what constitutes the LEGAL definition of rape, and those who are trying to build a world where nothing even close to it happens to anyone. 

People primarily concerned with the *legal* definition of rape posit, “haven’t most of us had bad sex we didn’t enthusiastically want? Or had sex when we were drunk? Isn’t it ridiculous to say we were all raping eachother?” 

And, I hear that. To that, I think the simplest answer that can be given to an insanely complex question is, “if it feels like rape for a specific person in that situation, then it is rape for that person.” Do you and your long term partner often get a little buzzed and also enjoy regular sex? If that’s not rape for either of you, great. How lucky. 

But with strangers? You just can’t know what the threshold is at which they can or can’t consent. Which is why ENTHUSIASTIC AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT is the gold standard a lot of us are pushing for. It’s why we say that “anything less than that is rape,” even if it actually comes with the caveat that maybe it always isn’t for every single person. 

For a lot of us, rape culture feels so deeply entrenched that we feel the need to push for the most extreme standard so that society can MAYBE BEGIN TO APPROACH even a halfway decent model for consent. 

I can’t speak for everyone, but that’s why *I* say “anything less than enthusiastic affirmative consent is sexual assault.” Even though I’ve had experiences that didn’t have that, in which I personally wouldn’t consider myself raped. 

Does bad sex = sex you don’t want , thus bad sex = sexual assault = rape? For some people, that feels like a stretch. For others, that seems a perfectly obvious, logical axiom. 

We’re at a turning point where not all of us are on the same page or even have the same language to describe the extremely vast and messy spectrum of what bodies can do with eachother. 

Do I think Aziz Ansari should be put away for life for what he did, be boycotted, never have a career again? Personally, no. Not unless we started doing that equally to every single person who’s come onto someone and pressured them for sex, which would be, frankly, 95% of all men ever and like a solid chunk of women and other genders of people. 

Not even the prison industrial complex would have room for all the cells we’d need to fill if we put everyone away for what Aziz did. 

But at the same time...people have done to me less than what Aziz did to “Grace,” and I wouldn’t call it sexual assault or rape, but it still fucked with me and hurt me and I felt like there was no justice. 

And sometimes I feel like all rapists ever should be hanged, even though I’m morally against capital punishment. 

That’s how deep trauma runs. 

It’s not logical. 

And our responses to things like rape won’t be rational. 

And they shouldn’t have to always be. 

We need to make room for people’s hurt, and rage, and inconsolability. 

I think a lot of people push back against #MeToo because of the thought that — under these new, expanding definitions of assault — they, too might have assaulted someone. And they fear what that means when the rest of us say things like all rapists should be hanged. 

TL;DR — All I’m saying is, none of us have the same exact language for this thing we do that hurts eachother. I think some people are downright evil and I think they should fucking die. And some people are deeply flawed, and socialized to harm us, and feel entitled to it while being well-meaning, but they still need to be held accountable for what they did. 

But can we start acknowledging that our divides on this issue have a lot to do with the failure of human language to encapsulate indescribable physical and spiritual agony,  and be gentler with eachother?

7qsqvg," I once dated a girl for a bit about 8 years ago.

We started out slow, just going on dates and such. Then one night she asked if she could stay over. I said sure.

Now I have had at least 3 girlfriends by this point in my life who I had a sex life with, so not too awkward to not get women, but I wasn't making notches on my bed posts.

So when this girl comes along and wants to spend the night, I take that as a cue that we are about to have sex. We start making out, and I'm waiting for another cue from her for it to go further, but it doesn't. So we kinda just lay there in bed holding each other, when I hear her sigh. I ask what's wrong and she says that I'm not being aggressive enough.

Now this is weird because I thought me asking her out initially, her wanting to stay the night and us making out were clear signs of both our intentions, but I was just waiting on her to make one more move to really solidify her interest in having sex. 

So we talk a bit and she said that I need to act like a man and take what he wants. Well that's a scary proposition considering I don't want to just take sex from someone. It reminds me of this bit by Louis CK. It's pretty accurate of what happened that night, regardless of what people think about him now.

https://youtu.be/b4hNaFkbZYU

So since this girl says this and I don't want to be my awkward self and I like her, I turn to her and start kissing her aggressively and start trying to have sex with her. At this point she gets into it for a bit and then asks to go to the bathroom before what I assume is going to be the final act. When she comes back she says she is done for the night and wants to leave. I'm fine with it, but now I'm embarrassed because of how awkward that whole situation was.

Well I come to find out from a friend who works with her that the next day this girl is going around her office telling people our date went bad and that I was acting like a young boy who hasn't gotten any in a long time and was acting ""kinda rapey"". I called her right as soon as I heard she was telling people I was being rapey. I asked her to stop telling people that and to talk it out with me instead. She didn't see what the big deal was because she said that she wasn't telling people I actually raped her, just that what I did was too much. I asked her why she wanted me to be aggressive in bed then. She said she did, but the way I did it was not how she liked it. I told her to stop telling people I am rapey if she didn't like something she asked me to do. She told me it wasn't that big of a deal.

😐

Being known as a person who is ""rapey"" is kind of a big deal.

Edit - Thank you for the gold. If I ever run into the girl again, I'll let her know something positive came out of our brief stint together.",2018-01-16 20:12:16

69xqxh,"Hey Reddit! I’m Savannah, head of communications at Purple, and I’m not surprised to see this here – this guy has been seeding this all over the internet, from at-spamming people on twitter to running paid Facebook posts.
 
We totally value your input here and agree that on the surface, this situation has all the makings of a company who just doesn’t get it. The thing is, we do. What you’re hearing from this reviewer sounds horrible, and that’s totally intentional on his part. We appreciate you giving us a moment to share our side of this story, and then if you have any questions we’re happy to answer them here, by email, or by phone.
 
First, we want to share some information about who Purple is. We are a Utah company focused upon bringing technologically advanced comfort products to the market to resolve and alleviate pain experienced by consumers while lying in bed, sitting, or standing.  

The company’s founders have a long history developing safe and effective products, including the development of critical care products. For almost 20 years, the founders have been creating comfort technology that has been used in a variety of products from critical-care medical beds (Hill-Rom), to footwear (Nike), to ankle/knee braces (Johnson & Johnson).

Next, we want to address the notion that we’ve had paid “trolls” in these comments. We assure you we have done no such thing. This comment is our first here; we are thrilled to know that Purple users are quick to come to our defense, but we have neither asked nor encouraged anyone to jump in this thread. 

We cannot say the same for the reviewer in question, however. There is a well-documented history of fake accounts commenting on anything positive about Purple with negative comments and links to his content. See the comments by “Bill Nyer” on this recent TechCrunch article: https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/purple-a-utah-mattress-startup-youve-probably-never-heard-of-is-on-track-to-unicorndom/ – we believe that Bill Nyer isn’t a real person, but a fake Facebook account created to bash our product and seed links to HMR’s content.
 
Now, about this suit. There are two important points we hope you’ll consider. 
 
One: The safety of the powder (this is where we get into the science and data). TL;DR: This powder is safe and there are lots of studies that support this (get more info here: https://onpurple.com/blog/studies-show-polyethylene-
common-safe) We also addressed this on our website through a blog post: https://onpurple.com/blog/non-toxic-plastic-powder — and the reviewer in question already knows it’s safe. What he wants us to tell is the exact, patented composition, and that we are not going to do. We have strong reason to believe he’s working with one of our direct competitors and we are simply not going to give up patent-pending information to them (see more below).

However, just to make sure we're 10000000% sure this powder is safe, even when you breathe it, we had our powder independently tested. The tests were performed by two labs: Terracon Consultants, LLC and Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health, LLC (CTEH). Here’s what they found – 

-“Polyethylene is the most common form of plastic produced in the world and is found virtually everywhere in the U.S.”
-“Polyethylene powder is used in cosmetic products such as mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, eye shadows, face powders, and foundations.”
-“The measured particle levels detected are hundreds of times lower than health-protective standards established by the U.S. EPA...even [for] sensitive individuals.
-“Average daily breathing zone exposure levels to consumers is expected to decrease over time.”
-“Respirable polyethylene … particles that reach deep lung will not be absorbed and distributed around the body.”
-“Likely exposures of inhaled polyethylene co-polymer would be considered safe with a significant margin of safety.”
-“This analysis provides high confidence that adverse health effects will not occur in any consumers from inhaling or touching [Purple’s] powder that may migrate from a Purple® mattress over the lifetime of the mattress.”
-“Exposures would be hundreds of times lower than everyday particulate dust levels that have been determined to be safe even for sensitive individuals.”

Again, there is absolutely no question that the light coating of powder we use to keep our mattresses and pillows from sticking to themselves when we compress them to be shipped is absolutely safe. There never was any question, in fact. Although HMC tried to use a retired Harvard professor to say otherwise, the facts simply don’t back him up. According to the same independent report by CTEH, “...the opinions proffered in Dr. Godleski’s letter are not relevant to measured exposure data or in agreement with sound toxicological science.” You can get CTEH’s full analysis of Dr. Godleski’s comments here at the bottom: https://onpurple.com/blog/studies-show-polyethylene-common-safe

Two: Why we sued. We didn’t take this lightly, and knew it could be perceived exactly as it is here. So why did we do it? 

To clarify, Purple is not suing Ryan Monahan over safety questions, as he has stated. The lawsuit is a civil action for false advertising and false association under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and Utah common law and other statutory violations. It was filed by Purple against Honest Mattress Reviews, Ryan Monahan and GhostBed, LLC.

The court filings are public – we encourage you to review them before you make your final opinion. You can find them on file with the United States District Court, District of Utah, Central Division. They tell a much different story than you’ve heard, and certainly prove that we aren’t suing him for asking a few questions.

We've had many third-party reviewers try out our mattress. Some of them love it, some of them don't. We've never asked them to take down their reviews or change their opinions. We are not against third-party reviews - in fact, we love them. This situation, however, is very different because we believe Ryan Monahan, owner of Honest Mattress Reviews, is not ""independent"" as he claims, but is working with a competitor to disparage our brand.
 
We’re happy to share the evidence that supports our belief that Monahan is working with a competitor. It’s all public in the court filings, but here’s a link to make it easy for you to see for yourself some of what we’ve found: https://onpurple.com/blog/connections-ryan-monahan-ghostbed

And that’s our side of this story. We aren’t sending anyone in to upvote this, comment on it, etc. We are here to talk to you directly and honestly, and we’re happy to answer any questions you have. Thanks for your time.

69xqxh,"""Lack of Basis for Alleged Health Concerns

Given the chemical nature of polyethylene copolymer and the negligible potential exposure to consumers
of Purple® mattresses, it is clear that any and all health concerns that have been raised are without any
appropriate scientific basis. In particular, the potential health effects opinions of Dr. John J. Godleski
stated in his letter dated March 8, 2017, are not scientifically supported. In his letter, Dr. Godleski states
that, “Polyethylene is a common plastic formed into many structures. As inhalable microspheres, these
have the potential to cause respiratory irritation especially when inhaled in large numbers as shown in my
laboratory.” He did not address the available peer-reviewed lab animal data that indicate no toxicity, or
provide any estimate of potential consumer inhalation or dermal exposure. He did, however, cite in vitro
(i.e., tests in lab containers rather than a living organism) studies of guinea pig and hamster lung immune
system cells (alveolar macrophage) responses to protein-coated latex particles (i.e. particles that have
been modified to elicit macrophage phagocytosis) to measure oxidative stress responses. These studies
used high particle exposure that are not representative of human exposures. He also stated that, “In
addition, polyethylene has been associated with allergy in the form of either asthma or contact dermatitis
in sensitized individuals.” However, the scientific literature that he cited for support of this statement are
for polyethylene glycol particles, which are chemically and toxicologically dissimilar to polyethylene
copolymer. Thus, the opinions proffered in Dr. Godleski’s letter are not relevant to measured exposure
data or in agreement with sound toxicological science.""

69xqxh,"I emailed Purple a simple, polite question. Why did you say to ask questions, then sue someone who asked questions. Here is Purple's response. 

What is the powder?

The non-toxic plastic powder coating we use is polyethylene, which is a food-contact-grade plastic considered to be safe (FDA, WHO/IARC, and Environment Canada have all declared it safe for use). 

From a safety perspective this powder is no different than what you’ll find in baby sunscreen, or powder cosmetics applied to the face, such as blush. 

Can I inhale it?

Most of the non-toxic powder coating is removed in the assemblage process before the mattress and pillow are shipped. Any remaining powder particles are so small and so few, that these products meet the standards for clean room classification. 

Furthermore, this amount of dust by weight and size is considered safe to all persons, including those who are sensitive or have asthma according to the EPA. Through independent studies conducted on behalf of Purple, the amount of exposure is a fraction of the maximum safe concentration of particles. 

Is it dangerous?

No. The amount of powder on Purple’s mattress and pillow is completely non-toxic and 100% harmless.

Does it cause cancer?

No, the powder is not cancer-causing. 

According to IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), polyethylene is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans, meaning that evidence of carcinogenicity is inadequate in humans and inadequate or limited in experimental animals. 

Additionally, the Safety Data Sheet provided by our manufacturing partner confirms the powder is not known to contain a chemical substance known to the State of California to cause cancer, reproductive, or developmental toxicity under California Proposition 65; the powder has no known chemicals regulated by New Jersey’s Workers and Community Right to Know Act; the powder has no components subject to the Massachusetts Right to Know Act; nor does the powder contain any chemicals regulated by Pennsylvania’s Right to Know Act.   

Why did Purple file a lawsuit?

Purple is not suing Ryan Monahan over safety questions, as he has stated. The lawsuit is a civil action for false advertising and false association under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and Utah common law and other statutory violations. It was filed by Purple against Honest Mattress Reviews and its associates. 

The court filings are public and you can find them on file with the United States District Court, District of Utah, Central Division.          

Have you fixed the powder problem?

There is no problem to fix. The powder is used on our Hyper-Elastic Polymer™ in our mattresses and pillows to keep the Purple from sticking together during shipping. It also adds to your comfort, as the powder improves both the noise and feel of your mattress. We use a process to minimize and remove any excess powder before shipping. Any remaining powder is completely harmless, even for sensitive sleepers.

69xqxh,"So, it's NOT talc according to the report.  I figured the other option would be glass microballoons, commonly used as an epoxy filler.  

But no, the FTIR reported it as fantastically small polyethylene particles.  This is much smaller than plastic ""microbeads"" in facial scrubs etc, maligned because they were just being washed into sewage treatment that couldn't handle them, also they got into people's eyes and just didn't get tear'ed out.  But like 1000x smaller.

I've never heard of 5.8 micron polyethylene particles being used in anything.  So I'm looking at what exists on the market.  There's PE products but with a diameter 100x that.  MIPELON^TM is an HDPE powder (would probably show up as PE on FTIR) with a 10-30 micron size.  Keep in mind when the diameter is half, the particle mass is 1/8th, so 5.8 micron is a radically different thing.  FLO-THENE®UF is a 15-25 micron PE.

Now you could say ""just some random unnamed thing made in China"", that's not impossible but it seems unlikely.  These powders require specialized processes to make and they can't be copying an existing product if no product exists on the market.  My first thought is that maybe the market doesn't make 5 micron PE because it's physically difficult to make and/or useless.

Closest thing I actually know exists in this particle size would be Teflon dry lube,  2-5 micron.  No oil just Teflon particles and like propane for a propellant/carrier which immediately evaporates.  Actually there IS definitely food-grade Teflon dry lube.  

I wonder, could this actually be Teflon, and their FTIR attempt have mistaken the PTFE for polyethylene?  Cause I'm seeing problems with it being PE.",2017-05-08 20:33:51

Since it is smaller than non-respirable, then it is more dangerous, not less dangerous than non-respirable!

69xqxh,"Where can I read this study? Has it been published? I'd really like to see the actual data used for these conclusions, as right now it sounds like you've got your bases covered but there's no data to back it up. 

2nd Edit, question still stands. This report is just a summary of findings from a Terracon Consultants, Inc. report. I cannot find a link to that report or the actual data. 

Edit: Never mind,[ found it.](https://ooct02lw8lz4birov2w1j67g-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Final-Polyethylene-Copolymer-Safety-Assessment-5.4.2017.pdf) Not very reassuring though - The study author couldn't even get the acronym of the name of his own company right. In his first sentence of the study. Rushed study much? I wonder what else he didn't bother to proofread? 

> Scope of Work and Professional Qualifications
Purple® requested that I, Michael H. Lumpkin, PhD, DABT, a toxicologist with the Center for Toxicology
and Environmental Health, LLC (CETH), perform an evaluation of the safety of a polyethylene copolymer
powder and health risks to consumers using Purple® mattresses manufactured with polyethylene
copolymer (polymer of 1-octene and ethylene). ",2017-05-09 06:09:25
69xqxh,"""The average sphere size of the particulate matter on a Purple® mattress is 1.045 µm"" - [Here's a study](http://sci-hub.cc/10.1016/s0142-9612\(01\)00027-8) that looked at particles of polyethylene that come from joint prosthetics and happen to be just this size, finding that ""More than 90% of the [intracellular] particles were less than 1.0 µm in size"", and using electron microscopy, went on to conclude that ""Another important finding of the present study was that there was no sign at the ultrastructural level of toxicity of polyethylene. The ultrastructure of the cell organelles known to undergo degeneration in the presence of cytotoxic agents were basically normal. This,
despite the often large number of particles in the cytoplasm."" - Basically macrophages gobble this stuff up like any of the other junk in your body.  As stated below, pulmonary alveolar macrophages containing this stuff will eventually get coughed out.  Oh, and *the author of that 2001 study happens to be Dr. Gobieski, the author of the letter questioning the safety of the powder* on behalf of the HMR guy.",2017-05-09 23:13:58

ftsqt0,"As a secular Jew - I agree

EDIT: Not directed to post I'm replying to, only directed at the rest of the comments throughout the thread

Keep in mind please, not all Jews have the same dogma. Just like most if not all relgions today, spirituality and connection with the universe has been replaced with empty rituals and turned into a social status or symbol.

I'm a proud Jew, because of what we contributed to science, medicine, literature etc. However our identity has unfortunately been used as a tool to further political and financial gain. 

If you are indeed antisemitic at heart for the amount of conspiracy theory you've delved into it, I can understand  your sentiment but all I ask for you to do is, dig deeper beyond the Jewish Zionist agenda, once you find out who is really in control of Hollywood, the Media and financial institutions, you will realize that the elitist model is not a singular global power house. It is a financial war on such a scale that all we see is the trickle down effect. There are elites who are in warfare with other elites. Please remove hatred of Jews from your heart, and don't fall for generalization.

Most of us just want to live a normal life.
I don't hate my people, and for someone who knows just as much about the conspiracy as the next guy, if not more - I should be inclined to be a stereotypical self hating Jew, which I'm not. I'm a hater of structured religion and dogma, but I love my people, love the ones who don't hate and love every human being regardless of race, gender, nationality or sexuality. 

Please do your own research and look for the truth 🙏
God bless

If you have any questions just ask.

First of all, she's nonverbal. That's something that usually happens to a child after some type of trauma, often sexual in nature. So there's that, and that's already a waving red flag. On top of that, he is open about the fact that he chooses not to interact with her or speak to her at all, which is all types of fucked on fractal levels.

Then there's the fact that he changed her name to match the name of the female in one of his books, and changed his name to match the protagonists (edit: legally, by the way!!!). The female in the book is subservient and is basically a plaything to the protagonist. And the fact that he named himself and his child (I mean, renamed! hot hell!) is SO fucking disturbing that I can't even formulate the words to process that reality.

I'm sure there's plenty more uncomfortable details, but those are the ones I keep getting seen brought up and have verified on my own. Please, somebody else add onto the horror if they can think of any other disturbing signs and I'll edit this as I go along. 

Ninja edit: and, you know, who can forget him fucking in the same bed as her, literally having sex while in the same bed as a small child. Normalizing that type of behavior. Perhaps he can't even get off without that sense of taboo anymore, and nope, I don't feel one bit of bad for making that wild speculation.

Wildfires happen every year, these are worse due to the government limiting brush cleanup.

Maybe some nations in Europe that let in unrestricted economic migrants for over a decade. 

>Those that aren’t collapsing are instead being ruled by increasingly fascistic leaders. 

Example? Dont waste your time saying Trump, he's so far from a fascist its absurd to think he is one. Fascism was defeated by America. You probably believe the corporate media and think Trump actually called the neo nazis and while spremecists ""fine people"" huh?

>The people with wealth in power in our world have abused both to the point where there is little those of us at the bottom can do but to sit, watch, and prepare to clean up the mess once the dust settles. 

The world is more prosperous than anytime in human history. Capitalism has raised untold masses out of poverty and it allows the support of 7+billion people. It's working just fine. It isnt a zero sum game, just because there is a rich guy out there doesnt mean you can't work hard and also be rich. 


>Don’t worry. You can rest easy knowing that in a few centuries your ancestors will make the exact same mistakes because humans are seemingly incapable of learning anything from our own history. 

America is toaring back to life, in a few decades we will still be here as the leading superpower in the world keeping peace through strength globally.

Guess someone hasn't heard of Mixer! 😜

I would argue that for a tech company, focusing resources only in areas where you are currently dominant is what's irresponsible to shareholders. That's exactly the kind of strategy that will get your marketshare eviscerated by a startup.

A very common practice is to put resources into innovation and expanding to new markets in order to intentionally cannabilize your own marketshare with your new product/service. If you don't, a competitor or startup will. It's a core tenant to McKinsey's Three Horizons of Growth model, among other strategic models.",2019-08-20 12:38:37

#5 you can see the Rivercats in Sac (AAA team) but if you haven't ever been to a pro game I recommend taking the drive to the City and seeing a Giants game when the season starts back up. The bleacher tickets are really affordable.


#11 and #21 can be done the same day as #5!


#25, I have the trilogy on blu ray, the uncut directors edition. If you wanna waste 20 hours I'm down to watch it with y'all. 👍🏻


#31 I've never been there in the winter, but I've been there plenty of times in the other seasons. I say wait until spring when all the waterfalls are running everywhere. Just my advice for that.


#44 my brothers and a friend and I did this when we did a road trip to Idaho for the eclipse earlier this year. Picked up a couple hundred bucks worth of explosive fun and lit it off in the desert a couple hours outside Reno. For the good shit you'll have to make a decent drive.

6ig2c6,"I am ambidextrous, write lefty, box in both stances, and basically do many other things equally with both hands. My whole family is right handed so I had always tried playing guitar right handed until recently, I was hanging out with my pops and I flipped the guitar over Jimmy Hendrix style and it felt MUCH more comfortable. My main issue, and this may sound crazy to you, is that I have a hard time making my hands both do what I want at the same time. Does that make sense? An example would be that I can hold down the strings and strum but if I try to change keys(notes? tunes? Lol) I have a hard time doing it if I try to keep strumming. 

It's a bitch being even partially left handed in this right handed world we live in. And you are right about not listening to everyone on Reddit. They have some of the most rough, tough, bad ass keyboard warriors found on the planet lurking in these subs.

aw2v4p,"So I could be way off base here, but it seems to me that YouTube has no competition because nobody is going to shell out the kind of money it would take to rival YouTube without knowing that people would be on board. I understand that a lot of big names make a living from ad revenue but, at the same time, many of those people/channels make money from their own merchandise. Not to mention, Patreon has been around for quite some time and is a huge boon to creators mainly by, in my opinion, taking power over them away from YouTube. If more creators and supporters took advantage of that service, they may be able to risk jumping ship entirely and swimming over to another, more well-adjusted platform.

7tk5nl,"Fantastic share.  I find myself wondering if great music ever gets major label exposure through humble (e.g. one show at a time) means anymore.  I mean...I know there are artists who use independent means for digital distribution and then can 'blow up' through vehicles like Spotify, but how many garage bands are building a following little by little and then getting major label help before they get to a point where they are better off doing it on their own anyway.  Don't get me wrong...I love that I can pay $10/month to listen to almost everything I can search for but there is also something nostalgic about being told by some mid-major label: ""Check out this fucking amazing band we found.""  And yet, capitalism killed those labels that said ""Hey, check out this shitty band that sounds a lot like the other bands you've heard recently.  Oh, and the one decent song they have will cost you $18.99 since you gotta buy the whole album."" Yeah, never mind, my nostalgia can stay nostalgic.

azij0d,"We had quite the roller coaster. In an early ultrasound, they said there were 2 and went through something similar and we told everyone.

With twins (and triplets, definitely), it's automatically considered ""high risk"" and they wanna monitor more closely. So it wasn't very long after we had a 2nd ultrasound and the doctor told us there was only one. Explained to us that it happens, but the other baby is healthy and all that.

We had mixed feelings. We were scared that it had been twins. We decided maybe it was better than way. Can we really handle _two_? But also, we were really sad for that child that almost was. We updated everyone: ""False alarm, just one baby.""

With all the issues, they still wanted to follow-up and it wasn't long after we were having our 3rd ultrasound (before some people have their first!).

Same doctor, and he's casually like, ""Baby A's heartbeat is looking good, and so is Baby B's.""

And we're like, ""What? You said there was only one last time."" Which he pretty much denied (he didn't seen malicious... I think there may have been some legit miscommunication... this doctor is known for terrible bedside manner). But yeah. Twins. For real this time. We updated everyone again.

Turns out we _could_ handle it, but only just and with help. 😀 They are 4 now and so much trouble.

But man... I cannot imagine triplets! Good luck to this couple. 😀",2019-03-11 03:36:50

azij0d,"> Dont forget '$$$'. Kids are expensive. Dont forget '$$$'. Kids are expensive.

“Babies don’t COST money, babies MAKE money! Especially those little white ones.”

— Jerri Blank

For those of you unaware of that lovely quote, it’s from a [Strangers With Candy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Burden%27s_Burden), episode where Jerri is assigned a live baby in her high school health class in order to learn a lesson on responsibility. 

When people say “they could never make **that** show today”, this is the best example. A wonderfully hilarious and distasteful show that could never be made now. A young(er) Stephen Colbert plays a not-so-closeted history teacher, and Amy Sedaris is...disgusting.

Don’t fret things will definitely get better as you get older. Hell I would be honored to be your friend not only back when I was your age but even now that I am 37. As you would have probably guessed by now, since you are a quite bright lad, being popular doesn’t matter in the long run. Having a few trusted friends that you are really connected to is way way better.

ai4hb8,"I imagine I'll get some flack for being a catfish or something for admitting this, but I agree and here's why:

I'm a trans woman. I'm 32 and only recently began transitioning. Except I've basically lived a virtual life as my true self since I was 9. From irc to forums to MMOs, I've always presented myself as female and been treated that way. It was validating and often the only thing that made waking up worth it. Just to log in, be ""myself"", and talk with my friends.

All of that was only possible because people couldn't see my face or hear my voice.

Even now, as an adult, the prospect of putting myself out there in VR is intimidating. As a kid, I never would have even considered it. A lot of the time the reasons people are reclusive are things like their mannerisms, voice, etc. Text made communicating easier for people like that. I don't feel VR offers that same fantasy barrier where you can be whoever you are. There are just some things you can't mask then, whether it is a deep male voice when you're a girl, or a speech impediment, or just general awkwardness that you can't see in text.

I don't know. Maybe I'm just old and the world isn't as scary as I remember it being. But I feel like there are a lot of people who would miss out on that ""escape"" and freedom if VRChat of this kind were to become the predominant form of communication online. 

Part of the wonder of the internet was you didn't have to be who the world said you were. The more integrated reality and the virtual world become, the less that is possible. I just worry about the kids like the one in this video who don't find good people, but instead just get the same thing at both ends. Not that that doesn't happen already with VR, but I just imagine this kid walking into a virtual room full of kids like the ones at school and being criticized for all the same things, and then think about where I'd be without that outlet all those years, and I worry for them.

Sorry. Rant over. Trying to put off sleep and no idea what I'm getting at anymore. 🤗",2019-01-21 10:18:01

If you’re happy, good on you; on the contrary, I think everyone should have the equal opportunity to be happy and acquire wealth. When your government focuses on building finances for its established wealthy-folk, and not for bringing democracy for the people that’s where you have a problem.

This sounds suspect and doesn't really match up with psychoeducational or neuropsychological testing practices. You wouldn't get IQ tests every five years, because the scores are highly reliable and valid as it is when done correctly and there are concerns about practice effects. 

I'm also skeptical that you tested as a ""functioning retard (which isn't real terminology, were you thinking of borderline mental retardation?)"" and then later tested with a full scale IQ of 130. We're talking about nearly four full standard deviations variance, depending on what the lower end score supposedly was. 

And this isn't even getting into many other issues, especially that intelligence testing isn't used in isolation. A battery of various kinds of tests and assessments are used, especially if you supposedly had dyslexia, which would not come out much in intelligence testing. That's more of an achievement testing area.",2017-10-10 23:07:20

75ipi6,"you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

When did Hong Kong ever give a fuck about the civil rights movement or police brutality in the US. So why do these people feel entitled to be supported when we are half a world away. We get it Hong Kong, you are fighting for free speech that’s a very moral goal to fight for. However that is YOUR fight. That does not mean Americans or especially an athlete need to give their two cents on the situation. Lebron simply gave the most politically correct answer and you all are condemning him for not “saving Hong Kong”LMFAO WHAT THE FUCK IS HE SUPPOSED TO DO!!! Also it’s funny you all are saying that Lebron was bothered by the women calling him a pussy but most of you all don’t know that after this game Lebron came back from 3-1 in the finals to defeat the Warriors.

People who have no idea what they are doing and no knowledge of SEC regulations nor investment laws are very self assured that there's no way anything they are doing can be held against them and instead of trying to speak anywhere near eloquently on it it's just this type of stuff. 

Again, because we are all super liberal in my friend group I am seen as on the wrong side of history by not immediately thinking that just because rich people are suffering this is a good idea, but I have exposure to how these regulations are thought out and I don't see it going well for the people who initiated or drove this initiative. Maybe not for the people involved, depending on how regulators feel.

hxd5ao,"Lsd is so plentiful due to being measured in ug that it wouldn’t affect it at all. It’s generally ~10usd /dose just because it seems like an appropriate price for those who don’t have a connection to a distributer. 95% of lsd comes from a very small list of chemists and those chemists work for a “family” that works to distribute with the sole purpose of spreading the chemical that they believe in, in a spiritual-like way. Even a when it trickles way down to a street level distributer it’s not uncommon for them to be given 10,000 doses needing only to cover $500 in overhead costs. I know I’m making some blanket statements and of course there is other factors I just rly don’t think it would effect the price.
Edit: just want to also make the point that even if the cartel made the 80kg (cartel doesn’t deal with lsd) they still can’t compete with the higher up lsd chemists supplying most of the world because unlike cocaine and heroin, it doesn’t affect the organization to have to cut the price to put the cartels lsd endeavor out of business. Who wants to do cartel lsd anyway 🤮lol",2020-07-25 02:40:45
hxd5ao,"Yeah LSD in the 90s was everywhere. As a HS student we would get literal books of it and pop off to raves. I never sold at school, but many ran it through the halls.  This was like 96/97 or so. I had a good many trips when I was 14-16, before I hung it up for good. I was a minor but someone ratted me at a party and let’s just say they were surprised that a 14 year old would have such a large possession. Eventually I got bored of it and everyone wasn’t even using it in my friend group much anymore. They were selling it to make money, as it was cheap in bulk. Most were starting to take real mdma for fun, and acid was for the money. This was huge in New Orleans in the 90s and I was there around a lot of it at a young age. Back when crystal meth was even considered a high end designer drug, and not what it is today. Lots of LSD was also laced with Meth on the sheets at points to give the user a “good” trip. The feds busted up the Nola rave scene when I was a few months out. It was crazy and I’m sure there are documentaries, and reports on it. They used the crack house laws, and started restricting age. I met people from all around the world back then at a young age. The rave scene was gigantic here!

What’s funny is I didn’t even know what pain meds were back then, but knew all the others. By mid 2000s opiates took over big time and MDMA is really bunk or I guess Molly now and a mixed bag. I went to a few parties for old time sake in my late 20s in 2010. And the stuff was trash, crowds were smaller and touristy. Just not even close to what I saw in the 90s and even up to 2002.

Edit: wow that blew up my inbox, responses and upvotes. Made me happy to talk to so many. I’ve been a bit down at times recently, all the reminiscing and chats has def uplifted my spirits! Makes me wonder why I abandoned the PLUR motto, and not being more connected on a community level that we use to have. Thanks :) love you guys ✌️",2020-07-25 02:26:51

hxd5ao,"Yeah the mdma in the 90s was crazy good stuff. Double decker sassafras and high quality stuff. Now it’s mostly like 10% mdma if that and mixed with caffeine pills. Back then one tab would last an entire night. These days you gotta pop one every 3 hours. But egh, I don’t mess with that stuff these days. Cannabis mostly these days, and had an opiate problem for a bit and all that..that was legal prescriptions. But things are good, works good. But I wouldn’t trade my experiences for anything.

Your life means a bit less and you are a bit more connected to this world. Yes you are depressed... Yes it sucks... But giving up on life and leaving little kids behind seems oddly selfish. 

So, I loved Bourdain. I tried some crazy ass fruit named Durian (which smells awful but tastes delicious) because of his show. I often decided to stay a few days longer on business trips overseas because of his show... And I definitely never send food back because of his advice... Having said that, I feel that when depression is taking a hold of you (which has in my personal case), you pump yourself full of meds and always remember there is a little human being that depends on you... Just my own personal opinion. Chester Bennington was selfish, Bourdain was selfish... Still 😥 but there are those left behind.

Perhaps if the other parties then 'acted in reliance on that promise', incurring debts they'd be promised would be repaid, but I'm not sure how solid this reasoning is by Depp's lawyers.

The “Cutter Incident” in 1955 involved a flaw in the Salk  polio vaccine manufacturing process at Cutter Laboratories that led to  production of substantial amounts of what was thought to be inactivated  vaccine that contained live poliovirus. The result has been called “…one  of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in US history”\[[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R11)\],  with 40,000 cases of polio resulting in 51 cases of permanent paralysis  and five deaths among vaccinated individuals, and 113 cases of  paralysis and five deaths among contacts of vaccinated individuals \[[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R11),[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R12)\] 

&#x200B;

 The vaccine was estimated to have caused approximately one Guillain-Barré syndrome case per 100,000 persons vaccinated \[[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R17)\], resulting in 53 deaths \[[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R18)\]. 

&#x200B;

 There was one death due to a vaccine strain viral infection: a  3-month-old infant died from myocarditis after oral polio vaccine (which  is no longer licensed for use in the United States) and DTP vaccine;  vaccine strain poliovirus was isolated from the child’s myocardium. 

&#x200B;

 Although the evidence supports the safety of vaccines, there are rare  instances where causal relationships between vaccination and death have  been established or a plausible theoretical risk exists. 

&#x200B;

 Many vaccines have been determined to rarely cause anaphylaxis. The risk  of anaphylaxis is less than two cases per million doses of vaccines  administered to children and adolescents \[[29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R29)\].  While anaphylaxis is serious and can be fatal, death and other  complications can be prevented with rapid treatment using effective  medications including epinephrine, corticosteroids and beta-agonists. A  10-year review of claims to the US National Vaccine Injury Compensation  Program noted five cases of death from anaphylaxis after vaccinations \[[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R30)\].  

&#x200B;

 Live vaccine viruses are attenuated so they do not cause infection in  individuals with intact immune systems. Live vaccines, however, are  contraindicated for people who are severely immunocompromised \[[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R31)\]  since their weakened immune systems may result in the live vaccine  causing illness. Two published case reports describe immunocompromised  children who received varicella vaccine, and where vaccine strain  varicella zoster virus infection contributed to their deaths \[[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R32)–[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R33)\].  

&#x200B;

 There are at least six case reports of death among severely  immunocompromised persons that have been linked to vaccine strain  measles virus infection \[[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R34)\],  

&#x200B;

 Intussusception is a rare medical condition in which the bowel folds in,  or telescopes, on itself. It can resolve on its own, but might also  require medical treatment or in some cases surgery. In very rare  instances, it can result in death (less than 1% of cases in developed  countries) \[[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R37)\]. RotaShield®,  the first licensed rotavirus vaccine, was withdrawn from use in 1999  after a greater than expected number of reports of intussusception were  detected in post-marketing surveillance \[[38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R38)\]. The attributable risk of intussusception was estimated to be one case for every 4,670 to 9,474 infants vaccinated \[[39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R39)\] and one intussusception death after RotaShield® was reported in the literature \[[40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/#R40)\].

So glad I quit that shithole of a corporation years ago. That was back before it REALLY SUCKED too. I still know a few people in various positions of the company, and if the general public actually KNEW how bad they are, no one would EVER shop there. That company cares about one thing: profits. Employees are considered expendable assets, customers are reduced to a dollar amount and a script, and the ""recycling"" they do, it's actually just them reselling your shit to third world countries. They make a SHITLOAD of money off their recycling program. Iirc, the only thing they make more off is cables and accessories.

7d1dn1,"My arcade cool down for all scenarios is 18hrs after playing 5 games total. That's 500 credits 100 credits per match played. Some scenarios you can complete in less than 2 minutes. Compare that to my multiplayer games I average 250-320 credits per match ( I get these #s from my twitch stream if you'd like proof) average match lasts about 10 minutes per match. For multiplayer it doesn't seem to matter how well I play I've gotten only 4000 points and received 200 credits I've gotten over 14000 points and only received 300 credits. I'm not sure what the score to credit ratio is but I'd imagine that it's bad. I enjoy playing this game it's fun to me....for now. We get free dlc with this game however you'll need credits in order to receive the ""free content""  such as new characters and weapons. As long as I get free maps I'm okay with paying credits for weapons, but making me pay credits for hero's is frustrating in my opinion, but if you ever logged into SW heros for a mobile device they sell chacters for $50.00 US currency and you'd already be familiar with EA's business plan. I feel like this is a mobile game on console. If microtransactions were simply cosmetics or if I received a crate per level gained I'd be fine, however I don't. The game is still fun to play again...for now. Even if you payed 💰 for crates the crates are still randomized, so if someone is willing to buy crates with real currency they'd probably have to purchase alot. Do I agree with this crate system no I do not if we all complain will it be taken out probably not, however if we do continue to complain they might change how much credits we receive per match, lower down cool times and credit/scrap prices, and hopefully get crates per lvl gained. Damn I really wish myself and the community we're more involved in politics or at least shared the same strong beliefs for change when something isn't right to provoke not only more but better change not only for ourselves, but for our community and future generations to come.......

>To be fair, you have to have a very high sense of pride and accomplishment to understand EA games. The challenges are extremely compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay, and without a solid input of consistent gametime most of the sense of achievement will go over a typical player's head. There's also the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets. The fans understand this stuff; they have the addictive personality to truly appreciate the depths of these game mechanics, to realize that our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we CAN. As a consequence people who dislike EA games truly ARE niggards - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the meaning in EA's existential motto ""It's in the game,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Erich Fromm's psychologic masterpiece ""Escape From Freedom"" about reaching satisfaction. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated penny-pinchers scratching their heads in confusion as Chris Bruzzo genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have an EA season pass. And no, you cannot use it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 credit score points of my own (preferably higher) beforehand.

The unlocks are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of selecting initial values based upon data from the Open Beta, Battlefront 2 will go over a typical gamers head. There's also EA's other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch, which are deftly woven into this game development- the game's philosophy draws heavily from average per-player credit earn rates, for instance. The gamers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate that we'll be making constant adjustments, to realise that it's not just fun- they say something deep about GAMES.

**Edit: Highjacking my highest up comment to say thank you to everyone for the funny and lovely comments. Yogi and I are gonna take a break from Reddit for a while.**

Honestly I have pretty severe social anxiety and posting this was probably a bad idea in hindsight. I definitely don’t have thick enough skin to be on the front page of reddit. This was a (very sarcastic) “fuck the h8rs” video for Yogi and I know so many of you enjoyed it but I’m just too fuckin sensitive to handle the negative/awful comments and messages I’ve gotten. It’s not fake, and it’s ok if you think it is. I really don’t care. This wasn’t about “proving it’s REAL” so much as showcasing Yogi’s talent better than the original video did, and hopefully making people laugh in the process. Also, I made a few comments about skeptics having to ‘pay me for personalized woodchip videos’ 100% as a joke. I’m not trying to ‘scam’ anyone. I would literally do that shit for free if it made you happy.

Anyway, that’s on crippling anxiety. I’m gonna go back to lurking but I really do appreciate all of the love for my dog and the stories you shared with me. It’s been real. ♥️🐾",2020-06-13 20:06:47

Can't believe that we would think twice about not having a fitting punishment for a crime just because it might keep victims from coming forward. Fuck that, girls need to understand that falsely accusing someone of rape if serious. And the only way they are going to learn is when trash like her starts getting tossed behind bars. 

Edit: the fact that you guys downvote women needing punishment when they falsely accuse people of crimes is fucking retarded. Stay safe out there, men. And remember, always get that morning after txt saying they had a fun time.  👍",2017-04-05 00:11:30

I see a cop car at a red light as I pull out & go into the other lane to turn (they were in the straight lane). Light changes so I turn & so does the cop. Follows me almost the entire way back to my boyfriends. Pulls me over right before his street - I’m a  white woman who’s barely 5’2” & was in pj’s with the cigs & candy from the gas station on the passenger seat. Cops ask where I’m coming from, I gesture to the seat & say “Cumby’s, I saw you guys at the light.” Then he asks me where the firearms are?  I’m really confused & say “I don’t have any?” Then the cop at my window asks the other cop (who I didn’t even notice at first & who was standing at the passenger backseat shining a flashlight around) “do you smell that?” The other cop says “nah not today”. Then he tells me to sit tight for a min while they go to their car, he comes back, hands me my stuff & tells me if I’m going to be spending time in this town I should get my license to reflect that. I said “what would it matter, the car is registered in this town & you pulled it over anyway”. The cop said he pulled me over bc the car was registered to a male & a female driving it is suspicious 🤔. I tried asking them if the car was reported stolen (I knew it wasn’t) but he just walked away & got back in his car.

690e31,"If you're serious about getting off suboxone I'll tell you how I did it. When you're on it you feel normal for the most part so getting off sounds a lot easier than it actually is if not done correctly. 

Step 1. Idk what dose you're on, but wean down about 1 mg every week or two until you're taking only 1 mg per day. This is harder if you're taking multiple doses a day bc you have to cut out all but one. I liked to take my single dose in the morning, but do whatever works.

Step 2. Start skipping days. Bc the half life is so long, it's still in your system the next day. I started doing 2 days on 1 day off for a couple weeks then dropped to every other day then finally 1 day on and 2 days off. Buy a shit load of kratom and use this on your off days, it is truly a life saver

Step 3. Just stop taking it all together and use kratom exclusively. Kratom has a super short half life so I was taking it like every 4 hours haha but you eventually won't need as much. In fact, as your tolerance drops, the kratom will actually start to make you feel really good instead of just not sick. 

Step 4. If you intend to be 100% clean, just slowly taper off of the kratom and drop it all together. It's way more forgiving than real opioids and withdrawals are nothing to somebody who has been on a true rattle before.

If you stick to this plan, you'll be free from opiates within 3 months and it's almost entirely painless. One thing to be super careful of though, as you lower the subs dose, opiate cravings slowly creep back into the back of your head without you really noticing. If you're vigilant then you'll be okay, but don't fall for those addict ideas like, ""hey I haven't taken subs in 24 hours I bet I could actually get really high off a tiny bag of h, it'll just be once for old times sake..."". Just stick to it, go to the gym, fuck girls, go out with friends, and enjoy being a normal fucking member of society again with a bank account that actually has money in it. 

Good luck brother. And be better than me, I did this and was straight for 6 months before slipping a couple times, then a couple more, then back to a g a day. I'm working on it too. 💯",2017-05-04 01:30:46

Is it wrong for kids to make gymnastics tutorials? Is it wrong for kids to wear swimsuits? 

That's what the majority of these videos are. They're not weird roleplaying like we saw a couple months ago, they're not even being incited by adults, they're kids making videos with content that a small portion of the population happens to find sexual. If it's wrong to have videos of these things, why is it okay for the kids to do them in public in the first place?

And... how can you fairly control that? Obviously you can ban the people posting links to *actual* illegal content, but just timestamps? Heck, even comments that are only 'so sexy' or '💖💖💖' are going to be almost impossible to put in any proper context and appropriately block.",2019-02-22 01:44:31

Very few people would complain about their video being accidentally deleted as long as they are able to go through the review process to get it reversed.

This is one of the main problems with the copyright system at YouTube right now as well, the review system is a joke, it plain doesn't work.

I need to stop internetting for today,
I feel doomed.

UPdate::
5:45pm first & most importantly- i, nor my parents, have been killed. (Sorry to disappoint some) but its mainly been a windy🌴debris filled event, but most are structurally sound. 

There are still many without power (including my rents since 3am) all over town and central FL. Outage mainland & beachside, but by some generous chance, we only lost it twice briefly- more like flickering on/off. I hear generators evrywhere, but our corner in the nhood has had power throughout.

Clearing the drain down the road routinely helped minimize flooding substantially. Rain and h2o levels were steady and seem to have rose to road level by the docks and river but there are not overflooding like some spontaneous rainstorms can bring. For this, i am seriously grateful.

I was up before dawn and am glad to not have panicked and dipped out. Being stuck on the road during would've been way worse that in a stable environment. We relaxed has much as we could try. My SO made seared tuna, delish ginger chicken tinola and we attempted to watch a movie. The rain def made us sleep good, but the wind did nOt. 

FLoridians can get use to ""sheep"" news, but i respect the forces of mother nature and know we got heavily spared from its possible wrath & are BLESsed.

With all the contents of my heart, thank yOU to those who kindly cared for our well-being. The time u took to comment and keep us in your thoughts may have created a protective energy to help deviate this helluva storm... Probably not, but I'm thankful nonetheless cuz there are random internet souls who have shown more concern and compassion than my own relatives. 

If u haven't seen enough pictures and want more from our prespective, lmk. 
For all your time and kindness, I'll reciprocate with visuals.

lx0f62,"You actually have a very strong point lol.

Generic medicine is actually really good.

Since some pharma companies care zero about saving lives but rather generate profit I sure as fuck am glad we have alternatives.

Big companies either gain monopoly over an item and sell it for a ridiculously high price or copy other and sell it cheaper.

Actually there is one very important I just thought about. Advertising, in the case of groceries, companies advertise their products hard meanwhile the no brand will only have appeal to people who cant afford the product that is more advertised.

With amazon they definitely advertise their copy way harder than the initial products.

In retail it tries to bring value to customers but we all know the generic are rarely as good as the regular product and we definitely know the product that they copied it from. With amazon it sounds more like they try to keep their monopoly and not everyone actually realizes that it is a copy.

Very good point though. Let me know what you think 🤔",2021-03-03 22:42:47

ir3ug2,"My best friend has a daughter 2 weeks younger than my son and we are (were) very close. Her daughter is a very talented cheerleader for a well known group that has won many competitions around the country. One day, she posted professional pics of her daughter in uniform and makeup posing in standard cheer moves. One of them is the standing split. She was facing forward and under her skirt had tiny black “boy shorts”. You could see everything. She was 13 at the time. Without getting graphic I advised her mom to take that pic down cause there are weirdos on the internet. She literally laughed it off (which she does when she’s offended) and we have been distant ever since. I thought long and hard about possibly overstepping my boundaries before I spoke with her about it especially since I don’t have daughters so like, what do I know. I finally did because if your best friend can’t talk to you about stuff like that, then who could? Why would anyone post half of their child’s genitalia online complete with a full face a makeup? “That’s just cheer culture” she said, “You wouldn’t know about that” 🙄",2020-09-12 19:17:08

It’s extremely hard to curb what my kids are influenced by on a daily basis. Social media has poisoned our children’s ability to see clear from right vs. wrong.. it’s always soooo grey and muddy to filter out what they should be striving for. 
Dance is my girls favorite subject to watch on you tube and stuff ..  they already sexualize young kids on Dance Moms and bs ..  but a movie like this is horrifying to see and undo everything I’ve been teachingn her about self respect, whats appropriate for her age and just plain fucking common sense.

The three of them performed satanic, sex magic rituals together called Babylon working. in an attempt to bring forth the antichrist in the form of a human baby.

I AM EVEN TAKING COURSES TO UNDERSTAND DISABILITIES BECAUSE I LOVE MY IMPERFECTIONS INSIDE AND OUT. What really gets to me is that they accept videos of girls trying to look like Barbie's or Kim Kardashian ect (which is predatory) but disabilities, something that we have to be born with and suffer negative torment about on a daily basis.... nope, not allowed. My dream is to meet this really nice man and women who make this video and tell them that they have helped me to accept my physical and mental disabilities. They ROCK. LOVE THEM FOREVER. PLEASE KEEP DOING WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DO . LOVE THESE GUYS KIND GIVING NURTURING AND UNDERSTANDING HEARTS. I'm 100% with them. For them. I'm passionate about disabilities. Its what I want a job in.  And to do courses in. Its so interesting and fascinating. Plus I love helping the environment too. YOU TUBE SHOULD KNOW BETTER . YOU TUBE WE ARE IN THE 21ST CENTURY, THIS SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED!!

SUCK IT UP GOOGLE. we cant help being BORN with disabilities, there's no cure. And why should there be!? You guys are just a walking insult at Google HQs.

I was first introduced to both Stephen Colbert & Steve Carrell when they appeared together on _""The Dana Carvey Show,""_ which was an incredibly short-lived _and_ highly underrated sketch show. Look up _""Waiters who are nauseated by food""_ and I assure you; you will _not_ be disappointed. That is where Colbert developed his fake-puking technique and has now perfected it as the king of late night TV. 

And yeah, _The Late Show with Stephen Colbert_ may not be as good as _The Colbert Report_, but his ""meanwhile"" segments get you as close as you'll ever get to it nowadays. I personally like seeing him as who he truly is. And what he is doing every night, holding 45's feet to the fire, is the exact definition of courage, integrity and ultimate honesty.

a0vog1,"Basically what every r/Futurology post amounts to.

Technology isn't actually magic. It can't do everything. There are some things that are physically impossible. Appealing to ""**the future""™** as some panacea cure to all of humanity's problems is naive and dangerous.

Landing on the moon is just as dangerous then as it is now. Saying that Voyager has reached interstellar space is about the same as saying 40 years have passed. It's always had enough delta-v to leave the solar system.

So you didn't actually have to talk with your fiance on a corded phone in 1999. Cell phones existed in 1999, in some cases even in smaller form factors than modern phablets. They were still a niche product, but they were available.

Yes, video chat has come a long way from the early days of using stickam and skype, but the delay still exists and will always exist. There is no way to eliminate the delay. It's not possible.

Just like how you can't just engineer past the gravity, the lack of sunlight, the radiation, the fact that landing on the planet is incredibly dangerous, the sheer distance from earth resulting in delays of around 7 minutes, etc.

To dramatize how dangerous it is on Mars, let's compare it to Antarctica. Antarctica research stations require regular resupply because of how harsh the environment is. If you placed a very experienced survivalist with nothing other than a hunting knife and polar clothes on Antarctica, it is unlikely but possible that they would survive for an extended period of time. There's air to breathe, water to drink if heated, snow and ice that insulates well for creating a shelter, and food that you can hunt.

If they were exposed to the surface of Mars, in an instant, all of the air in your body would escape and your lungs would collapse due to the air pressure being 1% of Earth's air pressure, the boiling point of water would drop below the Armstrong limit, and your blood would begin to boil, you'd be severely sunburnt, you would asphyxiate from the carbon dioxide, and you'd freeze to death as the temperature is routinely lower than the winter in Antarctica.",2018-11-28 02:08:58

7xf2bc,"/u/a_little_revolution was trying to let you down softly but it's very clear you've never even strapped into a snowboard, let alone dropped into a pipe.

Are you actually listening to half the stuff you're writing? 5.8m backside air isn't an ""impressive height"" when it's literally the second highest in the event and one of the highest in history? He didn't ""flourish with a board grab"" even though he clearly grabs melon?

**Wait.**

Did you just unironically use *routine* to describe a snowboard run? Is this gymnastics? We're flourishing now? I'm fucking dead man 😂 

I don't even know where to start because there's so many things to pick apart. I guess first thing is: anyone who rides pipe at a high level knows a 5 is easier than blasting a huge straight air. A 5 is the easiest rotation you can do that involves actually spinning and takes you from normal-to-normal stance. A big straight air is much more challenging because you can't take your mind away from the trick, so you're always conscious that you're way above the deck instead of letting muscle memory take over. Same reason why one of the hardest 3s for NBA players is straight from the top of the key and why zero spins are one of the hardest tricks in skiing.

Straight airs are not for setting up in competition. This isn't a skateboard halfpipe, where they need to generate more than the potential energy from the ramp height by pumping and airing. The snowboard halfpipe is sloped downward and any energy you need can be generated from the initial roll-in.

Straight airs in competition are for one reason only: demonstrating control and style. These are pro riders, a front 9 *is* basically a straight air for them. If there was any incentive to do 5 spins instead of 4 spins and 1 straight air, literally everyone would be doing that. But it's about *how* you do the straight air. It's a benchmark, it takes away all technicality and exposes everything else. The scoring is not cumulative on a trick-by-trick basis, but holistic for the execution of the run.

Let's break two runs down now:

**A:** 1 (straight air), 14, 14, 12, 12

**B:** 14, 14, 5, 12, 12

The unknowing average person probably thinks the B is harder, because ""hey 5>1"" and ""the 14's first so it has to be perfect!"". Already talked about that first point so onto the second: it really doesn't matter because if either run had the slightest sketchiness in any of the tricks, we'd no longer be talking about a gold medal run.

What people don't realize is the difficulty lays in *linking* up the tricks. Land one hard spin is very disorienting and may put you in a less-than-ideal state of preparedness for the next trick. So really what we have is:

**A:** easy-hard, hard-hard, hard-hard, hard-hard (3/4 are hard-hard links)

**B:** hard-hard, hard-easy, easy-hard, hard-hard (2/4 are hard-hard links)

Putting the 5 between the 2 14s and 2 12s is a breather in the middle of run B instead of having to drop all your hammers back-to-back-to-back-to-back in run A.

This is why I hate reddit sometimes. I get, it's that one week every four years when everyone is suddenly into snowboarding. There's nothing wrong with not knowing a lot about a subject, but don't pretend like you do!

During that incident, the May 12 complaint alleges, the 57-year-old performer “told her she was ‘[lucky he didn’t kill her](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/bill-murray-accused-drug-spouse-abuse?page=0).’”

y'all on reddit like to act as if abusive men who threaten to kill their female partners aren't, what — a dime a dozen? that it's *sooooo* hard to believe so many men pull that kind of shit on a regular basis?

2020 has taught me, above all else, that I am smarter than the vast majority of people. To even waste time trying to correct the course of this sinking ship of a civilization is evidence of stupidity; just have fun, advance/protect yourself and those you love, and exploit the legions of idiots for personal gain if you can. But to care about “the big picture” or anyone else? Nah. I don’t think I’ll ever vote again... why bother at this point lol. Let the chips fall where they may, after the tidal forces of the bell curve + social media have eroded the foundations of our society down to an unrecognizable mess. We the superior will survive and thrive regardless, no matter what happens in this reality TV show, this perpetual special olympics we call a country. Enjoy the show.

One other thing has struck me during all this... at some point during the lowest of our lows I had wished for a voice of reason and enlightenment in all this mess, someone like Mr. Rogers (“won’t you be my neighbor”). But then I realized that OUR PEOPLE WOULD NO LONGER RESPOND TO THIS. Mr. Rogers’ brand of kindness and quiet resolve would now be seen as antiquated and corny; someone like Mr. Rogers would not be able to launch a lasting career in this world we now live in - it wouldn’t be marketable. Instead, the mindless garbage of the TikTok masses will persist and proliferate over all that was once pure and good. And I (and other individuals of innately superior constitution) will remain fine and well, albeit massively disappointed in these lesser creatures I must still call countrymen (and generally irritated that their grubby and greasy digits afford them equal participation in this true democracy enabled by social media, participation which they have never earned and will never deserve). Lord, do I wish that they would disappoint me less frequently, but of course the inferior never fail to let you down. It is in their nature, by design, within a godless universe.

He even showed me his new ID with the name on it, because I didn't believe it. 😂 He took it gracefully, and never told me his ""before"" name so I had to call him Frikard.

The honest answer: it's *really* hard for someone like this to navigate and survive in the world. It's pretty clear she's mentally ill. She survives the same way other mentally ill people do. Hopefully a lot of support from family, some support from the government, and whatever other help is available. We live in a society where little more, if that, is offered to such people.

93ks4j,"... literally no. Correlation does not equal causation is not only able to be measured out BUT its also a logical statement. 

Something might be true is differant than, ""this totally makes sense bc of this"" bc something maybe being true requires a calculation but something simply existing is an observation but not necessarily true.

So if you can calculate whether or not legalizing sex work will decrease divorce rates, then sure but until then, correlstion does NOT equal causation 😊

Edit: oh look http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/a3121120.nsf/home/statistical+language+-+correlation+and+causation

I am all for legalizing sex work but lets not act like its for or will impact divorce rates. There are too many variables involved. Also? It would still be an act of cheating no? Wouldn't that imply otherwise, that divorce rates may rise? 

I really don't care, but I'm just pointing out you can't simply make claims like the one you did (which can lead to harmful consequences for young people reading this) when it comes to something as nuanced as sex work & its legalization.

I was floored at the lack of comments shaming *her* for subjecting him to this, putting his face out there, harassing him at his workplace, etc.  Imagine if the roles were reversed and it was a man stalking a girl at her job and posting her online despite her telling him no.  The police would be called!  People would be saying to tell management to ban the customer!  But instead they were praising her for putting herself out there and talking about how cute the guy was 🙄",2022-01-01 14:11:00

etc.

I've found that the lack of high-budget actually provides us with a filter for those who want money/fame vs. those who show genuine interest in the topics they explore. A smaller budget also allows for less pull-strings by those who might control the money like production companies, shareholders, etc.

If YouTube is suggesting to you daily vlogs and Logan Paul on your homepage, that's because the algorithm knows you're watching daily vlogs and Logan Paul. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Entertainment is subjective.

792ihf,"Check out the Yamaha P-115 88-key digital piano. It goes for around $500, sounds great, and has weighted keys that feel a lot more like the real thing than most electric pianos I'd used previously.  I bought one about a year ago, after taking 12 years of lessons, and then playing infrequently for over a decade.

Where I'd previously been mostly playing the same songs that I'd learned 10 years before, I've since been playing and teaching myself new pieces almost every day. Bring able to move it around easily really helped, since I can move it to areas that I spend more time in, like my home office. Also, connecting it to a PC and messing around with virtual instruments is fun. 🙂

buviqu,"I had an AVM (arteriovenous malformation) burst in my left cerebellum at 22. I'm 29 now and you can't really notice the after effects much from the outside. Though I still can't keep my left and right foot in perfect sync while running, make precise movements with my left hand, and sometimes walk a bit wobbly or steer to one side outta nowhere, lol. Those things are more noticeable to me now so I correct the action faster. 

It's really amazing how our brains are able to rewire themselves. The first year required a cane, but then more physical therapy helped. Recovery is a long and annoying process so I'm so proud of her for supporting everyone out there going through it. 

I had no idea Emilia Clarke supported TBI (traumatic brain injury) charities and unfortunately had several TBIs herself.

She really seems to sincerely care about the cause too, which makes me love her so much more. 

My ❤️ goes out to all of yous guys who are recovering right now. It literally gets better everyday. Don't lose your drive.

Edit: For anyone who cares, an AVM is something that one is born with and is virtually impossible to detect until it bursts/bleeds. 

After I experienced the first bleed they didn't do much but keep me hydrated and fed at the hospital. But a few months after that I was able to get a procedure where they literally go in through your artery on the inside of your thigh and stick a catheter all the way up to your brain to seal up that vulnerable area. The doctor said that I was one of the most successful cases he's ever had and it will never bleed again. I'm eternally grateful to that doctor and hospital.

Edit 537: I was lucky to have people around me who swooped in to help me out even though I was alone in my own apartment when it (the burst/bleed) happened. 

I haven't heard of many celebrities coming out in support of TBI research/treatment. I hope this will be a positive trend because people love and praise these entertainers so much. Just their words could help someone in recovery. I was incredibly lucky to have had the support that was given to me. I know others are not so fortunate, so we must take care of them.


* Thank you so much, anonymous Redditor, for the silver! I was just telling a story to share with others going through the same thing to remind them that recovery is very much within their grasp, even when things seem bleak or confusing. 💜",2019-05-30 20:11:31

A lot of people don’t know that most of the injustices against the First Nations people only just recently stopped, for example the last residential school (a Boarding school system funded by the Canadian government where native kids were stolen from their homes so the could grow up away from the “satanic influence” of their own culture and be forced to learn about Jesus and the way of the white man) only just shut down in ‘96.

So when they see someone like me, half n half (mm creamy), all they see is a native person who ignored what white people did and put their own people aside. I wouldn’t say it’s an inferiority hate, it’s more of a race thing filled with hate and distrust 🤷🏽‍♂️ I just try to be nice to errrvybody but even I’ve gotten into some shit for going to the reservation my family is originally from, just for being white on the outside.

70ck7o,"Same thing happened to me when I was a kid. I was at the horse races during a Saturday afternoon. Probably 5 or 6 years old. A beautiful moth just landed on my popsicle stick. It had that long curly tongue. And was sipping on that sweet popsicle juice. And I was so enthralled. I still remember it very vividly. 
  
Well. He became my friend. He crawled up on my shoulder and I walked around all afternoon with him. Treating him as if he were my parrot. And I was a pirate. And I'm standing in line with my dad for something. And the guy behind me slaps the moth off my shoulder. And I turn and it's on the ground flopping around. I look st my dad and I'm devastated. And my dad says ""don't cry."" And so that's that. Fantastic traumatic memory from childhood.

bm4r0i,💯 👍🏼 The real “Special Edition”,2019-05-09 00:13:37
bm4r0i,"Holy shit!

This is spectacular! I remember when this was first being hinted and teased. Props to the creator(s?) for all the hard work. This looks great. Honestly, I really really want this in the movie. It fits more in line with the skills they both possess in the prequels, but it's obvious Obi-wan is no match to Vader now. It shows how powerful, cunning, and ferocious Vader is, something sorely lacking in A New Hope. This is arguably better than the Rogue One hall scene, imo.

Criticism: While the face effects are good they are not great. Some touch ups and lighting changes would improve it. Also a few times his face looks too small for his body. Second, there are a lot of quick cuts and odd camera angles. Quick cuts are great for action scenes because it shows quick actions! It makes things move faster and feel more exciting, but it is also can be a little disorienting if done too much. And some camera angles seemed... different? I'm not sure exactly how to word this one... 😅

Aside from those few nit-picky points, this is totally amazing and I really hope Disney hires those who made it to do something like it for the inevitable Disney rerelease of A New Hope.",2019-05-08 16:17:16
bm4r0i,That was amazing 😮 the only issue I had was that Kenobi does a straight-on jab type deal with his lightsaber once or twice and as far as I remember that's a move that only the Sith would use.,2019-05-08 17:45:54
bm4r0i,"OMG. I feel like a traitor because I liked that better than the original. 

I always felt the the lightsaber duel in ANH was stiff and basic, compared to all others in the series. Of course, it was two senior citizens battling it out. 🤣

And kudos for leaving the sacrificial smirk in. That is so much more poignant in the context of the whole story.",2019-05-08 18:30:01

bm4r0i,We need it please. Forget this new trilogy or any other Star Wars movies give us a Vader movie of him slaughtering everything 😈,2019-05-08 17:17:09
bm4r0i,"I agree.  Someone with way more knowledge on the Star Wars universe than me can probably elaborate better, but my understanding is that Vader's lightsaber style is a more power based variation that uses a lot of two handed attacks and puts pressure on the opponent.  I don't think Obi Wan used the same style, and was more of a counter strike or maybe balanced type variation.  Seeing how the fight plays out it seems like whoever choreographed this wanted to stay loyal to that interpretation of their styles.

Edit; As you can see below there are plenty of those people with way more knowledge on Star Wars than I 🤣  some really cool and crazy detailed explanations below",2019-05-08 15:17:49

mg8624,"Oh there is a hell. It’s just not here- not yet. Cubekun thank you your spot on.
God isn’t scary, nor mean nor unjust; she/he never will care what ranking you are, what color your skin is, who you are in life, if you are an alcoholic or heroin addict- we all know the sins that aren’t acceptable. Murder, violence, abuse, assault any and all perverse acts. There is a real disturbing level of deceit and manipulation going on in this world. The rich and powerful stuffing their already fat pockets while the poor starve and have hardly any clean water to drink even. Smh though our biggest problem is much more sinister, much longer lasting as well. 
So what’s going to come of all the orphaned children due to covid? Most have no one to protect them from the real monsters- the Jeffrey Epstein’s and Free Masons of the world. 
Though don’t fret, their time is coming. Hell is coming- it’s here. It’s not a right verse wrong thing, not evil verse holy- it’s simple really, many did blasphemous acts without playing the tape through. They thought they found an “appeal to heaven” but the reality is that couldn’t have been further from the truth. Nothing can be done now as they are already here and the course ahead is already in motion. Do your best to make amends, contribute to uplifting and find yourselves. For we all have exact same chances, same opportunity to be divine. Though don’t let God find you “with wood up to nose” as in the Bible’s Old Testament 🧚🏻🐇🕳👁👿🕸🦠🕷👽🧘🐲🔜🔥🐉",2021-03-30 07:47:54

The keep was different at least, but so linear it was boring. And I didn't care for the aesthetic of sanctuary/heaven. Leah was a dufus in the first act. And Deckard's death was laughably stupid. He's injured but is going to forge a sword with magic real quick before he dies. 🙄 At least the expansion takes us to a city like we haven't seen before. But I guess since D3's endgame is the point, this was all to be expected. Diablo 2, the campaign was more important as you'd just be replaying it in pieces instead of revisiting the locals for quick runs like in D3.",2021-03-30 11:49:08

But hey, you were right bro. Winters are getting warmer faster than summers are. 

>""The cold seasons are warming faster than the warm seasons,"" says Deke Arndt, chief of climate monitoring at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information. ""The colder times of day are warming faster than warmer times of day. And the colder places are warming faster than the warmer places.""

*And that is incredibly bad.*

Per the article you so kindly linked:

>But with warming temperatures, California's snowpack is shrinking, both because of increased snowmelt and because more precipitation is falling as rain instead of snow. Across the West, snowpack has already shrunk by 15% to 30%.

>California, the nation's largest economy and largest agricultural industry is heavily reliant on snow that falls high in the Sierra Nevada, which acts like a giant reservoir. The snowpack lasts through the winter and melts in late spring and early summer, sending a steady supply of water to farms and cities when they need it most.

>""That can have profound ramifications, west of the Rockies especially, when the timing of snowmelt is really important to how we operate reservoirs and share water with each other,"" says Arndt, of NOAA.

Ok...really not sounding good. 

>According to one study, cold temperatures that many orchard crops need could decrease by as much as 60% in California's Central Valley by 2100. 

>Warmer winters are also affecting the fruits and vegetables that California sends around the country. The state produces the majority of the country's supply of almonds, wine grapes, walnuts, pistachios and peaches. But many of those crops require a certain amount of cold weather, what's known as ""chill hours."" Without that, pollination can be delayed or incomplete, reducing the crop that farmers get at harvest time.

Less food bad. More food good. Heat kill food. Heat bad. 

And that's just California! This isn't just affecting California. It's affecting the entire planet. The entire world is beginning to lose major food sources.

>And when warmer winter storms cause rain to fall on top of California's snowpack, it dramatically increases the risk of devastating floods.

Oh look, more floods. 

>""Warmer winters will result in, usually, earlier emergence of adult mosquitoes, for example, that bite us earlier in the springtime. It means that larger populations will survive throughout the winter,"" says Duke University professor Bill Pan, who studies environmental change and disease.

More disease. That's so good for us 👍

But wait! There's more!!

>Deer ticks transmit several diseases, including Lyme, which has grown from a few hundred cases in Maine more than a decade ago to a high last year of more than 2,100. Cases of another tick-borne disease, anaplasmosis, have also surged in the state to more than 680, up from just single cases in the early 2000s.

I could keep going...but you get the picture. The planet is warming up. And people are starting to die. The food is beginning to fail. Keep in mind this will be a long process. In 30 years? Foods gonna be interesting for sure. Whatever. 

At least the religious nutjobs are getting their Armageddon. Wankers.

I would further assume that the polar ice caps melting so quickly, over a matter of decades instead of hundreds if not thousands of years, would be due to our pollution.

e64ivz,"Fenbendazole up to 500mg max preferably 222mg panacur C, along with liposomal vitamin C (as much vitc as she can handle before diarrhea starts) and B17 might help. 

If she can, chew 10 - 20 apricot seeds for natural b17 daily. Organic raw bitter. Taste them first make sure they're not almonds, they should taste bitter not yummy like almonds. Some sellers on Amazon been passing almonds off as apricot seeds.  Right now cheapest hunzagold are $15.xx they're in a red bag, those are real apricot.  Else best to drive to Goodness Me on mountain and test there seeds first before purchasing. 

My landlord shrunk a massive tumor on the side of his neck with b17, vit C injections. He had to fly to Germany.

My father was starting to get dementia and closer to the end when he was in the hospital the only name he was able to recall was my mother. That was the only person he recognized. It hurt. He had brief periods of lucidity and we could talk to him and give him comfort that we were taken care of and it was ok for him to let go and be at peace and when we were all home and together, he went in his terms. Not ours and he was set to go into hospice the day he passed away. That’s my dad - doing things on his terms. And how I remember him being defiant to the end  💙",2019-12-05 15:26:57

I have, over 10 years worked in mainly male dominated industries. I have been harnessed, bullied and degraded. But I have made some of the best friends who are males. I have never dated or hooked up with any colleagues. 
Some of these men and their wives, partners and kids are to this day some of my most cherished friendships, but I have been accused many times by other colleagues of, cock teasing, sleeping my way up, flirting to get what I want. 

As a woman and a mother I know that most of the time woman are the ones who are constantly putting other women down. We do not live in a society that builds woman up. 
I am very lucky that in my house I am treated like a queen everyday. I am raising my sons to treat and respect woman equally if not more than men because they came from a woman.

u7icgv,"Dudes a creep yo. Sure he may have had a bad childhood but that doesn’t answer how Amber Heard was the one with bruises and marks on her face and all he had was a slight blemish. The abused often themselves become the abusers. Ask any psychologist or counselor 

Abusers do this all the time it’s just like the rapists who use the same defense logic it was either “consensual” or “nothing happened.” And whining that he lost money, his career trashed? He paid her 7 million (probably as hush money) and then tried to get his money back by suing NGN and lost now he’s trying to recoup his money by suing her now.

u7icgv,"“Patriarchal bullshit” dude what are you talking about? Every major culture is a patriarchy. Matriarchy’s do not survive competition with other nations. Patriarchy’s do not force gender norms, humans do. It’s independent. Patriarchy’s are just how things fall because men outcompete non-male humans. 

Stop accepting the feminist nonsense. Women enforce norms on women more than men do. It’s not the patriarchy. That’s just how our power structure is because it’s what works in competition evolutionarily. It’s not a bad thing, it’s literally the only way for a culture to survive competition (source - literally zero matriarchies that’s are regional or world powers). 

Let’s not pretend patriarchies are bad. They literally are the only system we know that functions.

There is greater variance among males than non-male humans. There will always be patriarchies. It’s just how things work. Even if we try to force equitable distribution if influence and wealth, those nations will eventually succumb to patriarchies. When there are literally zero examples of capable nations that are matriarchies is foolish to assume that’s at all a good thing. 

Stop the internalized misandry. Men are fucking awesome. We are the ones who actually suffer violence and all. Stop accepting non-male human delusions as true, even with rape men report being forced to penetrate by women at the same rates women report being forcibly penetrated. Not calling it rape doesn’t mean it isn’t rape (source: CDC misandrists😚).

Let’s focus on objective facts and not the nonsense women pretend happens to them on tiktok. Look at how non-male humans roleplaying being in danger of being human trafficked. They’re not reasonable or rational.",2022-04-20 05:14:32

u7icgv,"Thanks for Sharing that, 

It reminds me of what the FBI, Media, and justice system did to Richard Jewell for being an underdog hero after the Olympic Bombing & they never even admitted fault to this day. 

Justice is always symbolized as a balance scale, but in the world today it seems that the scale can be out of balance and no correction is made. 

The value & ideal of justice is the constant pursuit to achieve that balance even if it may not be exactly perfect. I always love to see the stories where excellent balance in justice is achieved or strived for, but recently it seems some of the highest leaders or experts in justice are lacking the moral/ethical character, honor, & integrity in their sworn pursuit of balance. A single drop of poison can contaminate the purest of springs, merit should always come before blind loyalty, and we should always continue to learn & evolve through our experiences. 

A lot of the division going on throughout the world today could be thwarted by tipping the scales back into balance. It’s not a one-sided problem, the imbalance is being caused from all sides, and it will take a paradigm shift of everyone’s thinking to correct this imbalance. Accountability is a great start, but as as long as we continually ignore the correction of imbalance, the longer it will take to achieve equilibrium and peace.

eb1n68,"Unless it’s a “breaking and entering” blanked term and just to clarify, that term covers any unwanted/unauthorized personnel entering into your home, building structure of any kind, etc, (locked up or not, hate the tern because nothing has to be broken or locked sometimes to get into a building, car, or personal private prosperity, and is used  as a loophole in sentencing because it’s still entering an residence without permission especially if they claim I didn’t take anything I just got confused, which lessens the sentence in most cases.
But if it’s been secured within your home/barrage/barn/storage unite, etc, locked  etc (which is where the term breaking came from but the loop hole in court is I didn’t break I just entered and I didn’t have thing stored on me), that’s still a serious charge as, regardless if you’ve taken nothing psychically, because it’s also the thought of attempted theft or even with the intent of physically harming the property owns, it’s also priorities but less on the list unless you claim the intruder is still within the house, possibly armt.
 USPS/or providers offer package protection, so if this happens to you, they will send you it until you get the product properly, and the bank will (also a pain half the time) will also send you a refund if it’s valid.
Because of this law enforcement stolen packages is “low priority” to them if at all, which is why issuance in packages might be prices but if it’s something you think worth it, they WILL do something about it
Edit: they also don’t really care about outside property thefts as much as high profile packages, if you want full security, make sure your buying off rep vendors, will to work with reships in the first place, the pay for package insurance. 
There’s so much package security available that you won’t end up losing in the end.
Still shift that porch hoppers do this though, stealing is the scum of the earth and I appreciate this video to try to detur package thefts and they always make me laugh. Love them and keep it up!
Bottom line, package theft is real, it’s shitty, it happens, but there are a lot of options to get insurance on all packages, not hard at all but just a bit more then you’d went to spend but it works (for now).
 Not to mention it’s highly illegal to open somebody mail without permission and is a feral charge, coming from a family in laws that all work in postal service, so if they do get caught, that’s fed jail time.
Just a PSA post that hopefully helps someone out theee, much love and be safe 🤙
Oh, and if they steal anything in a lockbox, that’s a whole mother set of charges, so keep that in mind.",2019-12-16 17:16:37

I agree it is in poor taste, preying on children and those with poor impulse control. However, this is the world we live in. We need to teach/monitor our children better. 

I do not believe this business model is predatory or “evil” enough that it should require the government stepping in. 

I do believe if parents cared enough to teach their children the value of money and monitor their online activity better, and adults “vote with their wallets”, this practice will quickly disappear, or fall to a more palatable level.",2019-06-21 15:53:47

c38kef,"I was a victim of OW loot boxes. up until the last two seasonal events, I owned every seasonal skin in the game. I would buy 1-3 of the biggest pack. (I think it's the 50 pack) 

""luckily"" blizz later implemented a design where you are less likely to get repeats when a bunch of brand new items have been released. so overtime, I no longer had to buy more than one 50 pack to get everything. one time, I managed to get almost everything without buying anything at all, just grinding 20+ boxes via leveling. but I was only able to pull that off because I was already maxed out on all previous years seasonal content and the game had only new things to give. (ty blizz for that at least)

 I was also extremely lucky that not everything was purchased with real money. I DID spend a cool hundred or so, but I used most of my WoW gold to buy a lot of it. i blew close to gold cap (10 million gold) on fucking tokens  to convert to bnet balance and buy hearthstone packs and ow packs. 

I regret it every single day. I could have a longboy rn if it wasn't for me being obsessed with fucking having ALL THE SKINS. and I don't even play the game all that much. I just got sucked in the ""complete collection"" mindset. I never thought blizz would keep making new skins every year. I probably have no more than 20 hours total played but own 95% of all seasonal items. wtf is wrong with me. ffs I still put real money on the special ""limited"" release skins you buy for the tournament promo ow league. like the water tracer and fire genji. 

if I wasn't bankrupt in wow gold I'd probably still be buying them and I hate myself for it. I'm just glad it didn't get to the point where I use real money I don't have.

even now it still hurts to have gaps in my collection. like in hearthstone, I simply FORGOT to buy the 70 dollar pack with the rastakhan hero and cardback. I ONLY want the hero/cardback and was willing to put it on my cc even though I'm broke. I hate myself. 😥",2019-06-21 20:49:57

I started working in Southampton about 3 years ago and since I have been working there my asthma decided to reappear. Doctors say it is most likely down to a change of environment. Well, through process of elimination that is me starting work in Southampton.

What a dirty shitty place it is. I really don't know why cruise ships pull in there. I mean all they see when they pull in is a giant IKEA store. What a disappointment that must be, you are on a luxury cruise that stops off in Southampton 😂😂",2020-03-11 22:34:33

5p9qja,"You're definitely not thinking of the right award, because the main, official National Merit award is specifically chosen without regard to race or any other factor but score on the PSAT relative to others in the same state.

From their website:

>All winners of Merit Scholarship® awards (Merit Scholar® designees) are chosen from the Finalist group based on their abilities, skills, and accomplishments—without regard to gender, race, ethnic origin, or religious preference.

There are other official Merit Awards that have conditions like ""at least one parent must work for our company"" or are sponsored by individual universities and set aside only for people who commit to those schools. Both of those are possibilities, but they still don't take race into account at all.

However, there are also corporate sponsorships (called Special Scholarships) that go through the National Merit program to find students and have their own individual requirements, which can be based on race or religion or whatever else the donors wants to make the requirement. If that's what you're thinking of, then chances are your white friend never qualified for that specific scholarship in the first place. Someone most likely donated money specifically for black students, and it was run just like any other diversity scholarship. 

For that last category, the awards aren't actually run by the National Merit organization. They just have deals with National Merit to find quality students based on PSAT results, and then National Merit will go ahead and contact students who qualify for the awards and tell them they've been invited to apply for the corporate award.

I want to be a comp/electric engineer and nothing I can thing of that could be more awesome and inspiring than this adventure to immerse myself in, so maybe I see this differently than you. The culture, the experience, the gift of being able to see the world for more than this watered down, blasted, boring (🌊) scene that's been put up in front of us as to not ""sour"" our lives far surpasses any experience gained in your comfort zone.

741c5r,"Too be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand iDubbbz and Friends. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of socialogical science most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also iDubbbz' ironic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Ethan Clein's  material, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about CYBERLIFE. As a consequence people who dislike iDubbbz truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in iDubbbz' moral catchphrase ""niggerfaggot,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as a youtube star's genius unfolds itself on their smartphone screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a ""niggerfaggot"" tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Following her only lead—the missing half of his invention, the Scissor Blade—she arrives at the prestigious Honnouji Academy, a high school unlike any other. The academy is ruled by the imposing and cold-hearted student council president Satsuki Kiryuuin alongside her powerful underlings, the Elite Four. In the school's brutally competitive hierarchy, Satsuki bestows upon those at the top special clothes called ""Goku Uniforms,"" which grant the wearer unique superhuman abilities.

My argument is the title of the video makes you think only one person went in to that zoo to take care of that collection.... or just to make this video! 

I don't know how big that zoo is, but with the animals from that clip alone, my money is on at least 8-15 zookeepers sacrificed themselves and their night to stay at the zoo and monitor the pump rooms, hvac systems, barn temps, back up generators, prep diets, clean holdings, dig pathways and clear access gates, etc.

Point 2: whataboutism, thats not even close to a decent counterpoint. The USA has been meddling from the genesis of many of those democracies and is so intertwined with all the fuckery that yeah i think if the USA hadnt followed corporate and geopolitical interests in latam and just supported their American brothers in their fight against imperialism/ authoritarianism we would have a much more stable usa, way less immigrants escaping us funded death squads and way less smooth brained american shooting mexicans because der derker jerbs. 

Point 3: Filipino American war where thousands of filipino civilians died in concentration camps and mass shooting perpetrated by the USA. I guess you'll deny that's genocide. 

Point 4: again whataboutism, i would say the huge population of prisoners who got jailed for having a joint on them, the refugee children getting raped by ice smoothbrains in those camps of concentration of people aren't very free lmao do you live under a rock? Are you gonna say whatabout prc and Uighur? Or whatabout philippines murdering drug users? Yeah shame america is doing the same disgusting shit those degenerate governments are also doing. 

Point 5: sorry you cant say racial slurs anymore :( 
Even so its weird you thought i was referring to the left. Im referring to people in the centre mostly and some on left and right who all see trump for the retard he is and see the total denigration of the USA by him at an international and local level. 

Point 6: whataboutism again but i will say smoothbrain Islamists killing people indiscriminately is distinct from El Paso, and the Tulsa massacre (local government sanctioned) for example which were directly racially motivated so they're not very good comparison. Islamists just hate us europeans because we're not wahhabists regardless of race.

9ga5tg,"As an iPhone user, I would still not go to buy a Samsung though 😂

Headphone jack: Yes it's gone, either live crying or upgrade to to wireless, wireless IS the future. Period.

The notch: Every other phone except Samsung copied the notch from the iPhone, so yea, Samsung is the 'odd one out' here.

Fast charging: Yep, not everyone is in a hurry to get fast charging, most people would be happy if it's default though. If you really want fast charging just buy it, just like you buy everything else.

Download speeds: Since the processor is light years faster and efficient, it uses less ram and lower speed chips without effecting the overall performance.

Micro SD: There is nothing wrong in using the cloud. It's super encrypted and fully secure since it has your intimate and personal stuff, unlike an external memory card which can be sold to people is your phone is lost or stolen.

Split screen: With the form factor of a phone, you really don't need a split screen. For iPads, yes. Go buy an iPad.

Camera: See MKBHD's camera rating. I don't want to Spoil which phone stood first.

Apple pencil: Steve jobs was always against stylus. Go look at his reason why. Oh and excess stylus usage causes Carpel tunnel syndrome.

Powerful: Samsung has a 2D FaceID, iPhone has a 3D face ID. YOU decide which one to go for? 2D movie or a 3D movie?

FaceTime upto 32 people: it's not just iPhone that can do the FaceTime. iPads, mac and every Apple device can do that. It's a great Enterprise option for work meeting. Yes normal people can use that too, for free.

From the official Harley-Davidson test ride manual:       
>Prepare them for the experience. For new and competitive riders, living the Harley-Davidson lifestyle, if only for a brief time, can be a very exhilarating feeling that will remain with them long after the test ride. Gear them up with Harley-Davidson® apparel whenever possible - jackets, boots, gloves, etc. As they ride, they will become immersed in the Harley-Davidson culture and the attention that comes along with it.

I find this video beautiful and extraordinary.  It proves how everyone can “see the light” with a bit of ingenuity, freedom, and an open mind.  Science is not a big scary lie run by the government.  On the contrary, it is organized, curious individuals looking to progress and understand the world around us.  

We should congratulate these individuals.  A well done experiment in my opinion.

As a note, this group tried other experiments that ultimately failed.  They kept redesigning and got one that actually worked.  That’s science in its purest form.

6pdlvh,"Worked for a pizza chain years ago and we had one customer that constantly scammed us. They always requested delivery and would complain about cold pizza, lack of toppings, etc. They were less than a mile from the store, so usually the first stop. Policy was to deliver them a second pizza for free. They never tipped and the pizza chain didn't give credit for free deliveries, so it fell on the drivers to burden the cost. They did this every week and sometimes twice a week. It got so bad that drivers would fight over who wasn't delivering to that address. And some drivers figured the customer was going to complain anyway, so some pizzas got delivered upside down or shifted to one side of the box to make them mostly inedible. 
GM comes in one day and audits our deliveries and sees this customer in the computer. They just happen to call in while he's standing there. He watches everything like a hawk, the order, making of pizza, bake time, etc. He cuts it himself like he's filming a commercial, boxes it and slides it into a delivery bag. He grabs me and says he's riding along, holding the pizza on the way. He only hands me the bag in the driveway and sits in the car where he has a clear view of the door. I deliver the pizza, get the cash, make change, and we head back to the store. The customer has already called in claiming toppings missing, etc. the GM tells us not to do anything and disappears for about 20 minutes. He comes back and grabs me again and tells me to ride with him. Instead of a 2nd pizza, the GM delivered a $50 gift card to our competitor and told the couple that we would not be making any more deliveries to their address, and that maybe the other pizza place could get their order right. They said they didn't like the other chain and the GM said too bad. They were welcome to eat in or pick up, but no more deliveries ever. I guess they didn't think our computer was smart enough because they'd call in periodically to request delivery. ""Sorry, your address is outside out delivery area."" Come to find out, they had pulled the same scam on our competitor and they cut them off much quicker than we did.

2) Won't be found guilty of anything at all,

3) Will be back on House of Cards,

4) Just doesn't give a fuck, or

5) Just doesnt give a fuck AND is in actuality a sexual predator AND might be going to fucking prison.

He has the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty. In the eyes of the law. Since he's not in prison right now, **that right has not been infringed**.

Just for the record, rumors of Spacey being predatory towards young men **are not new**. What is new is that him  being an actor with a ""brilliant career"" isn't **protecting** him anymore. Just like Harvey Weinstein finally getting his comeuppance has in large part to do with him losing a lot of influence and money in recent years, hampering his ability to blacklist, bully, and intimidate his victims.

Spacey lost his job because the crew members of House of Cards who suffered under Spacey's harassment found themselves in a situation where the guy who can get away with it because he can end their career has been found out to have done it to others, too. They are not alone, and people are willing to listen for once. Netflix reacted as they did because they couldn't **continue to ignore his behavior** any longer under public scrutiny.

You wanna bitch and moan about his ""brilliant career"" being cut short? You wanna rail against the person responsible for derailing his work? Well, don't come at me with that, go find the guy who did his best to ruin it all  and tell him. His name's Kevin.",2018-12-25 00:14:18

When asked where you're coming from or what you've been doing, the correct response is ""I do not wish to talk about my day"" or ""I will not answer that without my attorney present"". Show them that their bullshit questioning and leading questions will not get the answers they want. Literally all of these bullshit questions should have been answered with ""I want a lawyer"".

I don't blame the kid. Not even a little. He was polite, respectful, and articulate the entire interaction. He followed all orders by the officer to the best of his ability and when he requested further instruction the officer intentionally mislead him in order to fullfil the officers agenda. The kid was clearly nervous, as most people are when pulled over by the police. Hell, I have multiple cops in my circle and they all say even they get nervous when they get pulled over 🤣

This cop clearly had an agenda from the second he saw what the kid looked like. He profiled him and nothing would prove him wrong. The officer is an arrogant piece of shit and I hope this kid takes him, his department, and his town/county/state to court and absolutely wrecks them. Get a bag, dude! 

Also, field sobriety tests by cops are a fucking joke. I've worked in the ER for 7 years so I've seen plenty of intoxicated people in my life. Even with over a decade of schooling and 7 years of on the job experience, it's still hard to tell just how drunk or high someone is. It's why we draw blood and test for alcohol levels. We don't even bother with ""sobriety tests"" because they're so fucking unreliable. Cops fucking suck at field sobriety tests.

7k82x7,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2017-12-17 00:24:15

Fuck that bullshit. So now the guy gets kicked off the flight and has to sleep in the airport with two kids. Great job flight attendant. Great fucking job you cunt 👍🏻",2017-05-04 13:31:45

6o2umm,Just so you know dude and this is from someone close to me- sleep apnea is where your neck fat (sorry) is so heavy that it's pushing down on your windpipe. If you're kinda big it's like this snoring but if you get bigger you start just choking yourself at night. If you drink and pass out you may not wake up. Coming from a place of love- see someone about it. 👍🏻,2017-07-18 23:33:31

8vi8b2,"*Many* years ago (👵🏼) a kid at school invited me to a local yoyo competition he was taking part in. He was a good kid in the ways that makes a kid really unpopular at that age - he was from a very religious family, but he behaved and avoided ""bad"" things and whatnot out of a personal code of ethics rather than because it was necessarily forced on him. I always liked and respected him as a person, but he was a little weird in a world where well-behaved was weird. The only other person attending that I knew was his cousin who had a similar story. So I assumed it was going to be this saccharin kids event where everybody has wholesome fun and loves Jesus. Which is fine, and is kind of what it was. But boy could they create magic with those yoyos. I didn't want to go, but I felt obligated to be nice to someone who was nice, and I learned a valuable lesson about judging books by their cover. 

Yeah, he was and remains incredibly wholesome and, yeah, it was a very family and kid friendly affair, but that's another valuable lesson I wish more of my peers learned with me: wholesome and kind and kid-friendly aren't bad words. Something can be all of those things *and* badass. Er, I mean badbutt. I think some people find their way around to that when they have kids, but way too many people I know in their late 20s/early 30s still roll their eyes at anything that doesn't allow gore/violence/swearing/nudity etc and it bothers me a bit. Why would you limit the amount of fun you can get out of life? There's a time and place for those other things too, if you want them, but sometimes it's nice just to be a big kid away from all of it.

Sorry for this random after school special moment, but the whole thread was bringing back memories and I needed to get it out lol. I just agree with you that there's a lot more to the world of proyoyo than people might assume. ",2018-07-02 16:42:17

58jr1o,"The populace. The commons. The normies. Now everyone acts meme worthy, everything is a meme now, everything becomes a meme if you tell people it is. Now what constitutes a meme is a picture on white background with black text. Or something stupid someone posted on a forum. ""Let's make this a meme"" used to be ridiculed, it still is, but now it's because it only reveals what is happening at every second of everyday and people don't like seeing the truth. People ""make"" memes now. Facebook friends, mothers, NFL social media accounts. Those aren't memes. They're still-born, kronenberg meme imitations shoved in our faces. And we laugh nervously. Some laugh because they're the closest things to real memes we have now. They remind us of the good memes, the gold, *real* memes. Most laugh because everyone else is laughing. ""@nonamenormie 😂😂😂 me"" they say, ""👏👏👏 yasss"". No. Meta killed the meme. Once memes became tangible, explainable, identifiable to the outsider that's when they died. If everything is meme, nothing is. 

The only good memes now are the memes within memes. The meta memes. You used one just now. ""Whom"". Whom indeed. ""Whom did this 😂😂😂"". Non-veteran memers will laugh at the meme. Real memers laugh at the ""whom"". These memes give me hope for the future of memes. ",2016-10-21 15:27:28

I’m a DJ, I live in a college city and when I say I’m a fan of karaoke I mean that I like seeing good performances and occasionally taking the mic myself. I used to do choir/theater in school so I’m concerned with giving a good performance and not being obnoxious. I guess I should also say this requires a few drinks first to get my groove going lol 

I have a friend who’s way more into than I am, so I end up tagging along with the group. In a few places I’m very familiar with the guys who come every week and sing the same 3-4 songs. Those guys do seem to take their time with their drinks...

cu6zp9,"I should preface by saying I've yet to try any psychedelics, but still I like to believe that reality is fundamentally far deeper than we are capable of perceiving from our inside perspective. I like to think of consciousness, or life, sort of like a pot of boiling water that bubbles up into reality as individual human and animal lives. (It's not a perfect metaphor so forget about water lost by evaporation for a moment 🤷‍♂️) Even though each one is its own independent thing for a while, when the bubble pops and the life ends you still have the same water in the pot. That is to say that life itself is a fundamental pillar of our reality – after all, if a tree falls in the forest and no one's around to hear it, does it make a sound?

l6hm3b,"In succession. I'll see if I can find the link. Someone explained it well using animals as the market participants. 

But while I look for that link, I'll try. 

Alice owns 100 shares of Acme Corp. 

Bob thinks Acme is overvalued, so he borrows Alice's shares, and sells them immediately to Carol. He'll repay Alice with cheaper shares in the future (if he's correct).

David also thinks Acme is overvalued, so he borrows Carol's shares and sells them to Elaine. David also plans on repaying Carol with cheaper future shares. 

At this point, the same 100 shares have been lent out twice. 

Now W.S. Bartholomew realizes what's going on, and decides to buy the 100 shares from Elaine. But he has a different plan. He's just gonna sit on them. He knows that David owes 100 to Carol, and also that Bob owes 100 to Alice, and both Dave and Bob will need to purchase these in the future so they can make good on their loans. ""Lots of demand for these shares!"" Mr. Bartholomew says to himself, as the price goes 🚀

**Lock the bolt to the rear, run the cable up the mag well and out the ejection port. Gun is locked.**  


Let's be clear on something. He didn't ***pick the lock***. He used the lock wrong and opened the trigger latch with a toy to release the weapon. He didn't use the lock as it was designed.  


He said *""I should note that there is not enough cable to wrap all the way around the gun"".* There isn't supposed to be. There should be just enough to get up through the magazine well. There is enough cable if used correctly. Had he locked the bolt to the rear and put the cable through the trigger well, not the ejection port, it would not be loadable or removable from the lock itself.  


With the bolt locked to the rear and the cable up thrugh the mag well, the gun is not lockable nor capable of being fired.  


I own many guns. They usually come with some form of cheap lock by law. If someone wants to, they're gonna get in. It's a DETERANT, nothing more.

anw8kr,"Right on! And forgive me if I go a little too deep, I just have a craving for this kind of talk right now:

One can think of us ALL as just DNA, trying to propagate throughout the universe. Everything we are made of is just a manifestation of DNA, built from chemical components readily available in our starting environment. 

Funny thing about us DNA, though incredible (and the only form of “life” we know of; with viruses being another peculiar replicating being to think about), we must constantly fight the entropy of the universe. One could consider an ideal scenario would be as you say, one mycelium-like force of clones repeating and repeating and repeating; however random changes in environment can and do cause errors in the replication process. A clone-being like this risks corruption - some change/mutation that ends its ability to replicate, or resource starvation - a point where, because the matter content of the universe is randomly distributed, there are no more chemical building blocks with which to build and replicate.

What makes DNA cooler-than-clones is it somehow managed to defy entropy by incorporating and utilizing variation. Through natural selection, DNA has been capable of acquiring new abilities and trying “new code variants” in the way of species, each of which can utilize different resources and can occupy different environments, all in the pursuit of finding the best avenue for survival and replication.

To bring it one final (I promise) step further, Humans are one variant of DNA that are *incredibly* unique! Our DNA code variant has not only been able to replicate its own code for manifesting chemicals around it for survival and further replication, but has developed an additional method of storing and replicating a new type of code: ideas. The fact that humans can pass not only genetics, but *ideas* from generation to generation has led me to believe that we are one of DNA’s best candidates for continued replication. Our genetic code can only get so “good” at replication across the universe as one “consciousness” with better and better appendages (though the Zerg may beg to differ). With humans sharing and improving ideas, DNA gains much more potential to leap the gaps between the environments where carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and phosphorus are scare, and go forth to pursue infinity and beyond.

So thanks for sharing your ideas 😄",2019-02-07 06:24:43

eowdi9,"My ex wife seems to be very into smart pompous smug types. I’m reasonably smart and was really obnoxiously full of myself. She stopped liking me as much as I became down to earth and decided I wasn’t nearly as smart as I thought I was. 

Her new boyfriend who I’ve met is very smart and equally full of himself.  Her ex before me and immediately after me were similar. Also her dad is the same way, yep classic her type is her dad. 

The great irony is she always wanted me to grow to be less so and she complains about it with him. I’m pretty certain if he becomes less full of himself she will lose interest. She hates being wrong and feeling like you are better at her at stuff, but she is totally apathetic about people who don’t think they are better than her and point it out 😂. She’s also the type who says she wants a guy that pays attention to her but is only attracted to guys that are less interested in her than she is in them. 

It’s toxic and she knows it but what are you going to do?",2020-01-15 07:23:07

who cares what some lame with no facts or knowledge says.  the content policy says be respectful to others, i assume that is for the comments but the whole video only show disrespect. seems to be quite a double standard.
