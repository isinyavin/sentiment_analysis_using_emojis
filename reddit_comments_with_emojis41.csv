l7afyx,"Aside from only allowing the losing side to operate freely today, the worst thing is learning about the gross collusion between Citadel and RH. Robinhood makes money by selling retail investor’s market data to Citadel. What this means is that Citadel pays to know what retailers are doing and act ahead of them. With highly tuned trading algorithms they can turn high frequency trading profitable, all at our expense. I say they owe us our once in a lifetime infinity squeeze.

We’re fighting for our right to live, to exist, and should we win today the 29th of January will no longer be known as a Wallstreetbets holiday but is the day when the world declared in one voice, WE WILL NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT! WE WILL NOT VANISH WITHOUT A FIGHT! WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON! WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE! TODAY WE CELEBRATE OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY!!!!!!!

Had 2 missed calls from a number a couple of weeks back, but no voicemail left. I knew it was from the local hospital as I recognised part of the number (all of theirs are ***** 452***) so I tried to call it back as I am awaiting appointments from a few different departments. A recorded message just says ""this number does not accept incoming calls"" and cuts you off.

Having no way of knowing which department it was, I figured I should just wait to hear from them again.
 
Yesterday I received quite a snotty letter from the Pain Management department telling me that they had tried to contact me 14 days ago and that as I hadn't returned contact, I was being pushed back to the bottom of the waiting list 🤬

vuners,"In Texas, because of their abortion laws, this would have to be correct. But in California, because of their pro choice stance, this would be incorrect. Why? Because if your state is pro choice it a know that the belief that life begins at conception is just that, a belief, and therefore is not a life (in fact) until it’s actual been born. But if you live in a “pro life” state, that means their laws support that life begins at conception. Therefore, ANYONE who has conceived, including people who have frozen embryos for IVF should be able to claim dependents on their taxes, welfare if necessary for however many embryos there are, ride in the carpool lane pregnant, and get HEEPS of state support (financial) for pregnancy because that “child has a right to an eduction from the start of its life meaning school systems budgets should support them ❤️",2022-08-03 17:36:21

Hell my mother was in and out the hospital during that first third or so, EVERYBODY WAS ADMITTED AS A COVID PATIENT so don't tell me shit about ""uninformed"" you little patronizing asshat.

But let's just sum this up anyway with as close to ""Facts"" as the data allows: --->This peak has twice as many cases vs *April peak*, six times the testing rate and a third of the deaths.<---

They should be aware that most people are idiots and even smart people can be idiots. It is a core element of design that your stuff should be simple and intuitive and if idiots can't use it, you fucked up because that means it is probably not a good design. 

Second, it still is verification. The people who had checkmark still have one meaning that for some number of people it still does mean that they are the real person and not that they paid. 

Third, the entire system is so god damn stupid it is almost malicious. The entire verification system was designed for verification, the checkmark exists because it wasn't designed by a dumbass (or more likely somebody who wasn't about to leave and actually had investment in their job). The symbol is there so it instantly meshes in your subconscious that ✔️ this is the person. That symbol has been drilled into your brain to mean that. It would have been so god damn simple to just make a different symbol and then you can recognize it is different from verification.

So, the woman identified the man who raped her because he *walked her home from Gasparilla* while she was so drunk she was stumbling… and it took 14 years to confirm that homeboy was actually the rapist by cross referencing her rape kit with samples obtained from the genealogy databases cooperating with Tampa police?

For those wondering, per the article the genealogy databases being used by police are GEDmatch and FamilyTree - which from what I can tell, are services you upload your DNA results to in order to find matches (like family members and whatnot). The rapist voluntarily provided his DNA for testing and then voluntarily submitted his sequences to two separate third party reference systems.

One job, I was the top performer by measured statistics - completed tickets, and by satisfaction via feedback.  They kept giving me side projects to do that I excelled at and got promoted twice at that place. 

The next place I was at?  I was the only person doing the work and was forced to do on call as well. I cleaned up their ticket volume and again got glowing reviews from the customers. I ask for professional development, different work, SOMETHING so that I’m not stagnant and all I fucking got were excuses every time I spoke to my manager. 

Same with the next place. Clients loved the work I did for them, I asked for more but they claimed they couldn’t give any more than they already were providing (nothing...) so I was done there.

Im all about people making a good wage,  The problem is that it may not be feasible in the labor market. If you want a living wage, stop doing work for less than a living  wage. Hold fast to those principles that your labor is worth more than the value it creates. 

Haven’t you seen this happen enough times where the labor is overvalued? ie.. $15 fast food wages being forced on a company? What happens? The workers get laid off and they get replaced or eliminated because their labor isn’t worth their cost.

This is basic econ, why should anyone be paid a wage at all if they don’t create value for society with their labor?

You are not “putting me in my place” but providing a perfect illustration of why so many people are so angry. I’m smiling as I am writing this knowing how far off base your assumptions are and how wrong you are about everything you have said. Its almost enough to dismiss your baseless attacks outright but I am enjoying how aggressively you want to disprove the actual facts of what I have done with my life to fit your made up and completely wrong narrative in your head 😂😂

So, you literally make money being paid to help other people? And I have to ask, is it with your own resources? Or is it the resources provided by the work of other people who are not you?? 

The irony here is amazing, chastising me for earning my own way and doing it without support while creating value and helping others do the same without necessarily profiting from it, while you do the mental gymnastics required to display such a condescending attitude while profiting (salary) from “helping” others. 

Please, again with the “punching down”? The only one throwing punches is you, and they have been missing wildly as you take swings in the dark at some imaginary boogie man you wish you could paint me to be according to your completely false narrative. 

I want people to succeed, I want them to rise, and I like to help those who are willing to earn it to be successful.  
I am not willing to waste my time with those not willing to put in their own effort to be successful, there is no way to help those who refuse to help themselves. I can leave those futile cases for you to make money one while you “help” them.

Lastly, if you want to accuse or pass judgment on someone’s mental state, don’t.  If you truly had the knowledge, understanding, or education in psychology required to make that kind of judgement, you would know that you did not have any if the information or facts to make that judgement in this situation. Save your emotional pop-psychology “opinion” as it only demonstrates the lack of knowledge on your part as it is not a reflection on my in any way...

ky1pt3,"Cross immunity?   You are grasping at straws here and seem desperate to avoid the most plausible and easiest explanation.   They all happened to escape the grasp of covid because they don't throw hissy fits about wearing a mask.

Why do doctors and surgeons wear a mask?    Come on, this isn't rocket science and there is no grand conspiracy.

Wearing masks helps stop the spread of infectious diseases.   Psuedo science has no bearing on reality.

You CHOOSE to believe otherwise at the detriment of society.

Why do you do this?   I imagine it has a lot to do with a raging sense of self entitlement.

>And why then in the US have we seen nearly identical epidemiological curves in each climate region? Many of these states have zero restrictions in place and peaked at the same time as neighboring states. Could that possibly be seasonality at work?

Again, the obvious answer is that all across america people like you refused to wear masks and helped spread it.   No conspiracy, no 5g, no seasonal crap.   Tens of millions of americans decided that it was just too inconvenient to wear masks and kicked and screamed and spread the virus willy nilly.

It's incredibly sad to see. 

But as the saying goes:   good times make soft men which leads to bad times.   Bad times make hard men, which lead to good times.

America is so full of softies right now and it shows.   #1 in the world by far in covid infections and deaths.   Great job 👏 👍 👌",2021-01-16 05:32:11

The slaughter of children and young people and unarmed civilians was not i doubt in the minds of the great authors of your constitution . Perhaps a better way of settling this debate would be through a National vote ?

As far as Anti-Vax stuff… the science is pretty solid and Joe jumping on the Anti-Vax bandwagon is just another example of irresponsible behavior lacking in accountability. “Free thinking” is not a viable strategy for combating a global pandemic. A cooperative, constant, consistent effort of sharing the latest science-based information is the only thing that will put this thing behind us. The elevation of hopelessly ignorant/obstinate voices for the sake of “freedom” will doom us to more and greater suffering.

q3zmnd,"You know what this reminds me of? Back in the late 80's I was sitting in the Courthouse branch of the DMV in Huntsville, Alabama because I needed to switch my Driver's License from Tennessee to Alabama. Now for those of you who don't know, Huntsville is a cultural oddity and doesn't have as much in common with the South as it's location would have you believe. You can thank the good ole U.S. Army for that. Huntsville is the home of Redstone Arsenal, the Marshall Space Flight Center, and several other really interesting organizations. As a result, it is way more culturally diverse than you would believe.

But I digress, so back to the story. So, I'm sitting there on my bench looking around the small room because I am bored. When what do I spy? Someone looking at the inner Album Sleeve for one of my Favorite Albums(then and now), Ozzy Osbourne's THE ULTIMATE SIN. Album sleeves were not necessarily plain white envelopes, alot of them where rather colorful and had lyrics and all sorts of images on them. Given that the guy was about 50, I was like ""What's up with that?"" That's when I noticed that he was taking notes ,very specific notes. This illustrates perfectly some of the problems we are having with information exchange today. He was copying down excerpts from the lyrics from the song ""THANK GOD FOR THE BOMB!"" And some of the other songs on that Album.

Now's the break for you to run out and stream that Album and Check out the Album Art.

Pretty wild stuff. I mean the Album Art Certainly seems Satanic and all that, and Ozzy is the Prince of ""Fu*k$ng Darkness"". Right, I mean he calls himself that! Right!? 

Not so fast. 

I've been using this story to illustrate people that blindly follow their beliefs to the point they ignore most of what is in front of them. There are many people out there that can indentify me with nothing more than this story. 

That dimwitted moron was so busy copying down how many times OZZY sang ""THANK GOD FOR THE BOMB"" that he left out the rest of the lyrics. The best example of that exclusion is: ""IF THAT'S THE ONLY THING STOPPING WAR........ THEN THANK GOD FOR THE BOMB!"".  

IT'S AN FF'ING ANTI-WAR PROTEST SONG!!!!!!!!!!!! The whole album is chock full of Ant-War Sentiment set to HEAVY METAL. 

Prince of ""Fu*king Darkness my A$$. Check out his song ""MY LITTLE MAN"" on OZZMOSIS.

Watch the backstage scene of Wayne and Garth interacting with Alice Cooper in the movie WAYNE'S WORLD. Ozzy has more in common with Alice Cooper that just his imagery.

IT'S ALL MARKETING BABY...... HOW CAN I GRAB YOUR ATTENTION!!!! Watch an Interview of Ozzy explaining how he bit the head of a canary in a meeting with record executives after he left BLACK SABBATH.

AND LAST, BUT NOT LEAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

WHERE IS RONNIE JAMES DIO WHEN YOU NEED HIM??????? Or even DAN BROWN?????

In all fairness it's about emissions as much as cost, maybe more so, for me. Diesel here is currently 1€ per litre (we don't do galleons), while petrol is maybe 1.04 or so? Idk it's pretty jumpy atm.

I have a 40 litre tank which lasts me the better part of a month in my hatchback, but filling it up can cost anywhere between 35 and 50 quid, usually. It does vary a bit.

Oh during the first lockdown petrol prices tanked to below 1€ for the first time since before I got my fucking licence (almost a decade ago). So.... That was fun.

3) he’s a great friend and honestly Canada would have been better with him than without him. He went back to Australia January 2020 and thinks failing the test was the best think for his life 

4) he also laughs at himself for it but he knew he fucked it up. He didn’t talk enough and thought it was stupid what he was being asked.",2021-04-05 17:52:58

The question was “when did the dodo go extinct?” and both 1682 and 1673 were answers. I left it to the end and had no damn idea what to put down.

All it does is hurt the poor people of the country in the hopes they'll rebel and create a regime that will be amenable to Western powers. I talked to a lady from Cuba, and a transgender lady from Iran, and the effect the sanctions have had on their lives in immense.

Cuba breaks my heart. The whole ""a ship that docks in cuba is not allowed in the US for 6 months"" feels about as moral as punishing someone for the crimes of their parents.

It's just hard to try and be nonpartisan and say that it's fair/just to continue to punish them for the missile crisis of the 60s. A missile crisis that largely came about [*because of sanctions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_arms_race) and actions of the US, due to ideological differences. [All whilst](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/01/the-real-cuban-missile-crisis/309190/) the US has nukes in Turkey and Italy, pointing at Moscow.

Just sick of the hypocrisy. If you're all free speech, free journalism, free democracies... Then don't spread false propaganda, don't [overthrow democracies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27état) to install dictators, don't shit in our mouths and call it pudding. Ffs.

🙃. But then maybe this conspiracy theory [got me bitter](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/23/gough-whitlam-1975-coup-ended-australian-independence), and I'm a tool for giving it 2c. If I could trust the US more, perhaps I wouldn't have let it get to me.

For more, ""Who coulda known...."" see the rise in teen pregnancy and fall in high school graduation rates when Texas banned sex education in school.

To add to this - when I was in middle school in the late 80s and very early 90s, I attended school in a town with less than 9k people, in rural TN, where there were more churches than restaurants. We had sex Ed and not just fucking abstinence only sex Ed. 

They showed us how to put on condoms using anatomically correct devices. We learned about STDs and we saw plenty of graphic pics. We learned about various health issues that can arise from anal sex if proper precautions aren't taken.

In the 80s in Southern Baptist saturated rural TN!

We also had someone who was HIV positive come and talk to us.

In middle school.

Same school, in 2021, they only teach abstinence only sex Ed now.

Every time I see a moron say “he’s spewing out lies!”, I laugh because it’s simply not true.

He’s been doing everything he has said he would do. 😊

He even was willing to make a deal for DACA people for increased border security, which we desperately need, which idiot democrats declined.( because they like the power they get from the illegal voters). Absolutely pathetic.

If you only watch CNN, MSNBC, CBS... then you are literally only getting one biased viewpoint. You are being fed “information” in such a way that you adopt the mindset that they want you to adopt.

I’m so happy reddit doesn’t represent what the actual people of America think. Or, should I say, I’m so happy (at least half) of America isn’t propagandized like the people and admins on reddit.

Fuck sakes just put the fucking handcuffs on him long before. He was trying to prove, look at me I have the power over you. 

I am someone that believes they have a hard job and there are some people that want to handcuff them at every turn to make it even harder. However if you can't handle that job and the pressure that comes with it you shouldn't do it. They also need to weed out the people that are in it just to abuse their power. That won't happen anytime soon because of the police unions. 

I can barely multitask to put a recipe together never mind doing this kind of work. I have slight anger issues, anxiety and I get jumpy or twitchy.

However, before you go saying stuff that you know is beyond discriminatory and/or inflammatory, I suggest you check the temperature in the room first!  To do otherwise, would not be a wise career decision!  You feel me!  And justice or more like revenge was served!  It’s not like they gave him a life sentence for killing an unarmed Black man!  If they did that, then it would newsworthy world wide!  Better yet, the appeals filed as a result of him getting a life sentence would have been beyond world wide!  It would of told the tale of the tape, so to speak!  Stopped people in their tracks because then they could truly see why the death and devastation that has been leveled on Black people in this country for no good reason!  I am not complaining!  I am just saying that after Washington, DC, becomes our 51st state, it is time for the US government to kick in and honor their previous agreement to pay all of us reparations!  They already have paid some of my ancestors,Native Americans, some money in regards to stealing their land and messing around with their casinos!  Yeah, go look up what INDIO - really means! It’s not a secret people!Just most refuse to recognize it!  What’s that? That I don’t know any Black person who can be considered 100% African who was ancestors were brought here by force or voluntary or whom were already here way before Columbus ever hit land!  He discovered nothing!  Therefore, he should not be celebrated period!  Now, maybe people can finally give Magellan his proper due!  Only in a perfect world!  If I am not mistaken, didn’t the US government have to pay some reparations to the Jews?  If they did, why?  So now it’s our turn!   I don’t know what the amount nor the type of reparations we are entitled to,  but I know they us as a people a whole hell of a lot!  That’s what everyone knows!  The million $$$$ question is, how are we going to collect it?  It’s not hard to make them pay it, we know what do!

Skechers is not considering and has no intention of working with West. We condemn his recent divisive remarks and do not tolerate antisemitism or any other form of hate speech.

At the end of all of this, I can empathize because I know the damage and dangers I experienced when I went off the deep end.  I don’t know his story and maybe he is taking his medication.  However the medication is one did me in at the end.  So that’s why I posted what I initially said.  You don’t have to agree with it but it’s my experience as someone who suffered for so long with mental health issues myself. 

I have the right to not like someone but I am not going to hold their feet to the flames if they are suffering the same as I did.  However there is never an excuse for racism, antisemitism or any sort of talk of hate on others because of their culture, PERIOD.

It could be argued that his inner circle is part to blame as well for letting it get to this point….They are the ones who say they “love” him, yet we see him wilding out on a regular basis.    To me, it might be time for him to look at the people he is surrounding himself with…?

8etnji,"Autism is not treatable - nor should it be treated, in my opinion. It's not a disease, it's a way of being. You're born autistic, your entire brain is wired to be autistic. It influences every part of your human experience - how you look at things, how you interpret things. It is, in my opinion, a perfectly valid and cool way of being.

I feel like all this anti-vaccination movement does is cause autism to be even more misunderstood and feared.

Not all autistic people are visible, not all autistic people are children or non-verbal or mentally handicapped individuals in need of life-long care and assistance. Many are adults too; perfectly functional adults. They learn to become invisible and hide their typically autistic behaviours (stimming, special interests, not wanting to make eye contact, non-innate social skills) by performing normalcy. Which is exhausting to keep up. 

That really bothers me, that autism is still so vilified that people want to hide it about themselves. It bothers me that so much misinformation about it is spread - still being actively spread. That the biggest autism organisation (Autism Speaks) actively seeks to hurt people with autism, by treating them as second-class citizens and attempting to ""cure"" them with brutal, soul-crushing methods. All to make them normal, when ""normalcy"" was never required in the first place. It's just a concept, decided on by the majority.

Attempting to cure autism is on the same level as attempting to cure homosexuality. It cannot be done, and to try it is inhumane.

I heard once that their god doesn’t judge those who have not heard the word of “god”. Some of them refuse to preach to others so they can save them from hell. If you don’t know, you can’t be held responsible. 😂

That Latino part you're mentioning, although interesting, it's not all that surprising to me. I get it, even. If I'm moving to the US from a narcostate, of course I want border security to be strong so those mfers stay contained on the other side, they're why I left in the first place. That's one example of many, of course, but I think it's safe to assume people are leaving their countries of origin seeking a better life. The overstayed visas and deportations part...

Edit: since this thread is picking up traction, I wanted to reiterate a few points that have been pointed out in the reply’s. 
Context is incredibly important here. To some people, this flag signals to his allies that their white supremicist cause is being represented. To the rest of the world, this guy looks like an idiot who had a hard time passing grade school. 
Much like the ok 👌 symbol has been attempted to be co-opted by supremicist groups (albeit as a joke). Using that symbol in public means “ok”. But with the right context (posing with the same symbol at a rally with known white supremicists) it could be seen as representing white supremicits. 
Personally I feel the best way to combat this is to take the context away from them. Keep making fun of them for trying to co-opt these symbols until they loose their intended meaning (see Pepe meme).",2021-01-09 16:44:39

I understand that you cannot change your own name until you are 18 years old.

But generally, over time, I’ve learned that when someone calls a “right-winger” inflammatory.. or racist.. or a bigot.. They’re not actually any of those things and the media have just built that persona and nobody actually looks into the actual things those people do or say and goes along with it.

exusqk,"She probably is a little racist from what I was just looking at myself, definitely inflammatory. 

I actually can not determine if she is racist or simply a little ignorant.

If that’s the nazi one, when she was made aware it had a swastika she deleted it from what I just read. 

I don’t know that a true racist would do that, unless they wanted to hide their racism. 

Assuming she is a racist that wants to hide their racism makes sense, and is why I can’t determine for a fact she is racist.

Possibly my idea of racism differs from yours... she has said racist things (assuming “sweaty jocks” is racist to the Scottish?) never heard that term before. 

She also put up an inflammatory statement it appears that racial profiling is a good thing. Sure sounds racist, but the thing is, there are probably good arguments for racial profiling in regards to use of resources.... I’d say it’s not an ideal thing to do... I don’t generally like the slippery slope argument but I don’t like good people being harassed because they fit a generalised description of the population who’ve been most involved in breaks in a specific location 😅....

I guess, as much as I despise her like Milo... id probably defend the argument the left is reducing the currency of the word “racist” by applying it to her.

Imagine if it was only ever used by people making calls to violence of a specific race or something.... the effect it’d have when “racist” was used then sends shivers down my spine. Even when someone begins talking about racial superiority. Fuck me that’d be a beautiful world to live in.

I guess now it’s basically worthless right if that’s the case? I was reading on Facebook today, that google will censor a lot more “right” stuff then left stuff. It also comes from Oxford dictionaries and dictionaries have always been “progressive” by nature. It is not definitive that the definition a dictionary uses is non-debatable - that’s a bit of a straw man if you ask me. 

Also, it’s a weak definition it’s been updated too. People show discrimination all the time to all sorts of people.... this doesn’t even state it has to be races other then their own or exclusively. Pretty ridiculous right? 

It literally says “against people of other races”... as in.. specific people.. of other races...

Say that slowly... as in... it doesn’t have to just be against other races... 

So literally, if I had an issue with a pedophile ring that existed in a Nigerian culture (I’m not Nigerian) I would fit that definition of racist undeniably.

My definition:

A person who believes their race is superior and/or another race is inferior and/or a person who believes different rules should apply to those.

After his daughter urged people not to vote for him on Twitter (her own father!) stopping just shy of outright calling him a racist, this Michigan Senate Republican candidate called her a Marxist/communist because she went to college (and probably came home and started asking questions at Thanksgiving).

Then, after throwing his daughter under the bus, he then actually had the nerve to equate people’s assumptions about his socio-economic and racial background (rich, white, male, middle-aged, Christian) as a stereotype he has to *overcome* as a *hurdle*. 😅 You can’t make this stuff up.

“I don’t buy into this whole systemic racism thing at all,” he said. “I’m not saying there’s not hurdles to overcome. We all have hurdles to overcome.

They didn't even have a publicly available case count for the school, and not once have they released anything encouraging masks. I understand that they are being bullied into it,  and I don't blame the principal at all.  He's one of the few that wears a mask, and he makes sure if he sees my kid that he has it on.  I did get him to add a weekly case count to their website, and he said he is going to put out a communication about strongly encouraging masks, but what else is he supposed to do.🤷‍♀️  he's stuck between a rock and a hard place, just like us parents.

n5eblm,"Ooh name calling and grasping at implications that I never made, that's not predictable or anything 🙄.

People like you have been indoctrinated, like cops themselves, to believe that their job is somehow more dangerous or deadly than nearly all other jobs. That's false. The most deadly jobs are loggers, fishers, trash collectors, among many others. That may have been what the other commenter meant by 17th highest death rate. You also seem to be under the impression that their job is inherently more traumatic than nearly all other jobs. Also false. Social work, end of life care, medical and health professions, firefighters, military, carry more risk of mental and emotional trauma *inherent to the work* than police work. 

I have sympathy for any *individual* who experiences a traumatic event or suffers PTSD. Police as an *institution* and their bootlickers and enablers who grant them all sorts of excuses for their extrajudicial violence and their fragile, cowardly culture of ""We'Re tHe oNLy REAL vIcTimS"" don't deserve sympathy. 

Parse out the difference between the individual and the system. Individuals can be severely impacted by the traumas they experience and no one ever claimed individual cops might not witness some harrowing, traumatic shit. But police work in the bigger picture is not as dangerous or traumatic as plenty of other professions, whose members (AGAIN) aren't going around killing people with impunity despite the trauma they endure on the job. There are plenty of 'good' cops who have been hounded out by the Fraternity of Fragility who have blown the whistle on this many times over, if you'd care to learn about anything that doesn't already confirm your bias.

n5eblm,"not refuting your claim in defence of cops (ACAB), but I believe the initial statistic suggested was that 1 of every 1000 black people in the US will statistically be killed by a cop

your numbers account for the total number of deaths, but not the total black population. 

more accurate would be to say that of all deaths caused by police, 1 in 1000 will be black. I'm not sure if that directly extrapolates to the population as a whole, but tbf I also never took a real stats class 😹 but what is true of the parts is not always true of the whole

if my interpretation is wrong I fully accept it, I've been wrong before and will be again! I just appreciate the chance to learn",2021-05-05 15:07:33

You are exactly the problem! You think just like them! It doesn't matter what he did in the past if he was killed for none of those reasons and unjustly.

Reading your statement, it actually comes across as if you think you made a valid point and that what you think makes makes sense and you just happen to know a little more than other people. Let me be the 1st, or maybe not the 1st, to tell you what you said is not valid and you are no different than people who think him using drugs in the past is justification for his death.

I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news - detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual - anonymous - stateless. They represent true economic freedom - not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy - chief -” I said. “Any rate the market offers is - by definition - fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got - Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry -” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later - I was on the scene. It was a normal office building - strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said - flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now - which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on -” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously - guys. Without a strong economic motivator - I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine - but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missingg..

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed - and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then - a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze - Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system - but - thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby - it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen - I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun - put a quarter in it - and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again - on purpose.

“All right - all right!” the man yelled - throwing down his weapon. “I give up - cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked - as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers -” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago - a central banker killed my partner. Instead - I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street -” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal - you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded - because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.",2020-10-06 18:05:42

Always wondered why they claimed to care for lives but not care about the fetus growing up in a bad, impoverished, or abusive household.

crazy  take what this person said above ☝️ now look at what the rt said 2yrs ago 
rt said 
lft was radicalized by mob mentality 
russian probe ( for four years mind you) 
facebook you tube etc cancelling conservatives 
antifa 
antifa chanting at trump rallies
how many dems supports for all the trump memes ? 
anti trump memes ? anti trump tshirts 
all the rhetoric and mantras against the gop no facts like in Russian collusion , kavanaugh , etc 

then the gop said the same now that biden is in office how it’s all collapsing 


“why you mad bruh” ? 

if anything the DEMS have nothing to complain about if the GOP just stooped to their opposing sides’ tactics

let’s be clear it’s 
not that i believe in these tactics i’d rather just say what i mean and do as i promised but ppl believe in the rhetoric and not the truth on both sides 

Dems - are feelings they want everyone to be happy and rich. That an omelette can be made without breaking eggs (they’re just not sure how)

If you want to keep pulling shit out of your ass, I can even go digging for some fun polls that show how overwhelming popular these awful notions are among the Republican voting base.

Your argument that ""mainstream"" Republicans are totally normal and basically the same as (largely center-right) Democrats is complete nonsense and is immediately, trivially thrown out the window by looking at a) who they elected president, b) who they still largely continue to support as president (his post-~~Jan. 6~~ attempted coup ratings were easily over 80% of all Republicans thinking he'd done a good job as POTUS), and c) the assortment of monsters and nutjobs whom they've elected to the House and the Senate.",2021-12-27 05:10:23

Go/turn was even worse, luckily that was easier to avoid. I could only imagine if I called candy sweets.

ios0oz,"I know no one asked, but I really feel for this kid.

 When I was 12, I was suspended from a new school I had just started at on the 4th day of class. A few of the kids were talking about robots taking over in the future or something, and I did a cringey robot impersonation and jokingly said ""we will kill you."" It was supposed to be silly. Even though none of the students gave a shit as it happened, the teacher + staff freaked out over it, so boom, suspension. My parents thought they were insane and transferred me back to my old school after that.

Enter high school, and almost all of those kids who saw me again remembered me as ""that kid who got suspended for threatening to kill people."" I was bullied for it, and it took a significant toll on my mental health. 

This is way more egregious than that was, and this kid's peers will likely remember this by the time high school rolls around, and then he'll have to endure that same kind of bullshit, all because shitty school staff like this base their decisions on knee-jerk, emotion-based reactions.

Edit: for posterity sake - I was not physically bullied, just outcast and constantly made fun of, the butt of everyone's jokes. Eventually everyone knew that I didn't actually threaten anyone, but they didn't care, they still used it to be hurtful. Teens can be assholes. By  Junior year, pretty much everyone stopped bringing it up entirely, and by Senior year many of my peers apologized for their behavior toward me, so I want to clarify that by the end of high school, the people who mattered made amends and everything ended up being okay.

A lot of the replies I've received show that there are many similar stories, and I am sorry for anyone who had to go through anything like this (or worse). If it's still fresh, I can promise you, it does get better with time. This was nearly 18 years ago now, so times are very much different than they were then.

McD was trying to make sure your coffee was still hot 10 minutes down the road, even though people kept telling them that was a safety hazard.

Part of the problem this case ran onto is, how do you punish McD so they behave better, but still accept that the injured party shared some blame. 20-30k is nothing for a company like that, but millions is rewarding the injured party too much. 🤷‍♂️",2021-06-03 13:49:46

No, it isnt so bad as all that. In fact life is going on pretty much normally outside of set areas downtown, usually near city halls or police headquarters, which most of the population avoids so as not to get wrapped up in unnecessary drama.

There's a lot of division just now, but most of it is ideological. Your average person just wants to go to work and has no interest in overturning the government much less going up against it in armed combat. I am sure that there was a ""quiet before the storm"" and a lot of resistance to the idea of people doing similar in the American Civil War (either side) and the American Revolution (either side, really- indeed there were those that wanted reform and not outright renouncing their British citizenship), but nevertheless: it is a rare person that wants Civil War, and those typically pose no threat, unwilling to actually take part in any such rebellion, certainly beyond a picket sign and misdirecting their anger onto random shopowners' windows. Not to suggest that there isnt real example of police brutality but there isn't near so much division and general unrest as [national] news coverage exclusively of conflicts between protestors and police suggests (again, this is happening in relatively small areas of city centers where people have gathered. I am not far from downtown and have had no issues whatsoever with running into conflict from either side.",2020-06-14 16:21:43

ojkea6,"The vaccine rollout has been a big mess of bureaucratic fuckery here in Japan. Last December the government announced that it would have the entire population vaccinated by June so that the Olympics could proceed without issues. Fast forward to this year, only 1% had actually been vaccinated by May.

There was no domestic vaccine development program so Japan has been completely dependent on imports. The govt conducted an excruciatingly slow clinical trial and after it was approved almost 20% of the Pfizer vaccine had to be discarded because Japan [didn’t have the right syringes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/10/japan-pfizer-vaccine-doses-wrong-syringes) 🙄

Vaccinations for 65+ didn’t even begin in earnest until May, but then the booking system was a joke and allowed users to [input any number without verifying whether it matched an actual vaccination voucher](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20210518/p2a/00m/0na/013000c).

Doing drugs? Please define the drugs in question. Because I’m pretty sure that your prescribing physician would have some opinions about regular use of drugs. But aLL dRuGs ArE bAd. 
Ok. So let’s talk about why people turn to drugs in the first place. Anyone excessively self medicating is in pain. Full stop. 

Perhaps they were injured on the job and became addicted to the prescription issued to treat their chronic pain. 
Or maybe, this was one of your beloved veterans who has lived through the horrors of war and has suffered significant physical and mental trauma but cannot get the services they desperately need as the government would rather throw money at VR for dogs than providing aid and care for these brave heroes. 

It doesn’t matter the story, all you need to know is that this is a broken person and needs your love more than your shitty judgement, Karen. 

They lose their job and in turn, their primary residence and turn to a shelter. Shelters are not always the safest places at night, where theft and abuse are common. Sometimes they are at capacity or prioritize women/children/families. This alone sends more unhoused men out into the world. And then trying to stay warm by sleeping on benches, subways, pretty much anywhere sheltered or off the ground. 

And then there’s people like you who somehow think you’re superior because of your perceived wealth and privilege. How fortunate for you that you personally have not experienced a series of hard times or a tragic live event that shatters your world and bumps your life off the track. How lucky you’ve never needed help from anyone. 

Never forget- you are not Jeff Bezos, a member of the Walton family or Beaty DeVos. You’re probably about one or two large financial setbacks from being unhoused yourself. ✌🏼",2020-10-17 00:05:27

kw3x0v,"💯 I have Bipolar II (which, contrary to popular belief is not less severe than I - we have a higher suicide rate and are more likely to rapid cycle or have mixed eps, both of which I've experienced), and the lack of proper care especially for folks who have recently been diagnosed is egregious. I'm ten years out from my diagnosis at 21, and functional for the most part - living on my own and holding down a decent job - but fuck it takes so much effort to do just the most basic adulting. And it's absolutely had an effect on my cognition (severe executive dysfunction and brain fog) and social life (I pretty much don't have one). Still, I'm incredibly lucky because I have well-off parents as a safety net. Because of them (and their insurance) I was able to take time off college to get proper treatment. Otherwise I would have dropped out, and would almost certainly be unemployed and on disability.

And yeah, inpatient is...not helpful, unless you're desperately suicidal and really need 24/7 monitoring. But it's not the same thing as rehabilitation. Bipolar is one of those conditions you really need to treat with a mix of psychotherapy, medication, and lifestyle management, and it can be incredibly hard to access all three of those.

A entry level employee called me to determine if a PR driver's license was acceptable, she actually did not know it was part of the US.

nvfe02,"I had a pup many years ago who was half border collie. She wouldn't do any herding if it was just us as a family, in our own spots around the house, but when company came over and we were just standing around, she started wandering around nudging people closer and closer together.

This of course would take place after the ceremonial sprinting around the house at light speed (the zoomiest of zoomies). She'd bark at the door, we'd introduce her to the newcomers, and once they were inside, she'd break into a headlong sprint that would go from end to end in our house. We had a very loooong house, shaped like a straight line, and she'd fly from one end to the other, zip around the living room once or twice, then fly back to the other end. Rinse and repeat. She'd run so fast that she wouldn't be able to stop suddenly if something (or someone) got in her way and she'd crash into it at full speed. She hauled ASS.

It was fun to have company sit down in the easy chairs and make conversation with them while a furry black and white rocket was running so fast around the room that you'd rarely see her feet touch the ground. We got a lot of, ""Is she - ? Is that normal? Wha- what is she doing?! Is she okay?"" and meanwhile we're just chatting, not bothered by the speeding bullet flying past us at a hundred miles an hour.

As opposed to “alt-left” white supremacists, huh?

Like... the political labels at this point can literally suck my duck. 🦆 

You know why they associate “white supremacy” with the “right” side of the “political spectrum”? Because it’s all a fucking MIND GAME.

It’s all divide and conquer tactics, and every time someone falls for the “alt-right” bullshit, they are falling for the brainwashing.

“Let’s associate ALL conservatives with the 7,000 legitimate KKK members left in the United States by calling those 7,000 morons ‘alt-right.’”

It’s done on purpose to ignite division. You may not THINK that deep into it, but that’s why you so easily fall for it.

Like why not call these communistic scum “alt-left”? Why is antifa not “alt-left communist supremacists”? Why can’t a “lefty” be a white supremacist? Sure, antifa pretends to hate white people, even though they are mostly white... but they throw balloons filled with piss and shit at people, punch women, and beat people in the heads with bike locks... but yeah let’s ONLY focus on the so-called “white supremacists” whose only crime is often one of thought... 

I mean, which is the official pizza of the ALT-LEFT feminist Leninists? I’m dying to know...

Yes, philosophy and mathematics intertwine occasionally, and yes, some mathematicians were also philosophers.

Philosophy was originally the study of knowledge, but in modern times, pretty much every single field that was originally apart of philosophy has diverged into their own seperate fields. Originally, physics was apart of philosophy. Is physics philosophy? In the modern sense of the word, no.",2020-10-11 04:28:15

And the puking and shitting. Oh GOD the shitting. I lived IN my bathtub for 24 hours just letting it come out both ends, there was zero control and so much pain..... I was convinced I would die right in my tub. Finally my mother came pounding on my door because I hadn't answered my phone (this was back before cell phones) and let herself into my apartment and found me in the tub like that. 

It was the most horrific pain and fear I've ever experienced.... even had two investigators from the CDC come to interview me, showed up looking like Secret Service agents while I'm laying there, half naked, on my hospital bed hooked up to a million IVs and machines, puke in pink bowls, im sure my room smelled of flowers and rainbows, and as close to death as I've ever been... last thing I wanted was dudes in black suits forcing me to tell them everywhere and everything I had eaten in the past week. 😒  Let's just say I did not want to cooperate LOL..

Like yeah the dude got lucky with his early career but his repertoire has never been anything more than making a good investment... Or just being plain old lucky. 

I have literally zero clue why anyone would attribute ""synergies"" ^^^lmao to Musk instead of... Oh I dunno, the countless engineers looking for more metrics with which to appease their Elon Overlord. The things his companies do are impressive and innovative, but he himself is just a mouthpiece. He might be the captain of his ships, but I guarantee he's delegated every possible duty he might have to the rest of the crews.

It seems very silly to me that anyone would think he has time to do anything ***other*** than manage the very surface of his assets. 100% he's operating on broad summary reports and various interesting snippets that he could make a clickbait-worthy headline out of.

And even then, like half of the ""synergies"" ""he"" has ""implemented"" are things that are either relatively new in general or completely commonplace. It's not like ultrasonic welding just dropped on the last hotfix of real life... It's been around, and there are.
 likely reasons for or against it. I guess SpaceX figured it was the best option. Other companies might not feel the same. Self-landing boosters are neat, but finnicky. The reason for them is probably a large part of why NASA moved to a shuttle design -- so that a large percentage of what's launched could be reused instead of being lost or turned into scrap. And stainless steel follows the same deal as the welding... They found it suited their purposes better than the alternatives, if that's even a unique choice amongst the space exploration sphere.

But buzzwords are great! He implemented all those synergies so good! He's literally the bestest businessman in the world!

I thought private businesses could do whatever they want (rhetorical: they can) That logic is being used to allow businesses to override lifted state mandates and freely discriminate against people based on vaccination status or mask wearing. Stay consistent. The irony and hypocrisy is undeniable. The owner is clearly making a political statement in direct response to what is happening inversely to people like him on a far larger scale all over the country. Wearing a mask at a place were you gather publicly to eat and drink has NEVER made sense in the first place.

Regardless, I have to think that if I had a child who was at risk, I wouldn't take the risk of possibly contracting the virus at a restaurant and then spreading it. To me, that's still horribly awful parenting. Why would they go to a restaurant that is VOCALLY anti-mask??!!! That'd be like me going to a anti-vax rally and saying out loud ""I support vaccine mandates!"" and expecting everyone there to agree with me. You just don't do that! And you also don't go to a restaurant that is vocally anti-mask with your mask on and your at risk child at home who you're about to be in face to face contact with again very soon!

I'm gonna ask the question again. And hopefully I get a coherent answer this time instead of an onslaught of downvotes and a bunch of responses calling me a QAnon anti-vaxxer Boogaloo Proud Boy white supremacist Trump-loving idiot.


OG fAiLeD cRiTiCiSm:

Why would any parents in their right mind take their at-risk child to a public space during a pandemic just to get a bite to eat? Consider the fact that even if people are wearing masks while entering and exiting the building, they are most definitely not wearing masks while eating and drinking, so the likelihood that the virus is in the air in the vicinity is still pretty high.

The only answer I can fathom is either (a) these parents are really just that stupid, or (b) these parents purposefully endangered their child just to make a pro-mask political statement and get media attention.",2021-09-22 00:08:37

Here's one with an even smaller serving size, that proves my point to the extreme: https://www.tictac.com/us/en/faq/

>The Nutrition Facts for Tic Tac® mints state that there are 0 grams of sugar per serving. Does this mean that they are sugar free?

>Tic Tac® mints do contain sugar as listed in the ingredient statement. However, since the amount of sugar per serving (1 mint) is less than 0.5 grams, FDA labeling requirements permit the Nutrition Facts to state that there are 0 grams of sugar per serving.

Do you see what I mean? There is no way to get any accurate information when there's no requirements to show decimals & no requirements on how small a serving size can be. That's why it makes a lot of sense to have per 100 grams. Where I currently live (Sweden), most products show both anyway, so it's not like you lose out on the serving size info by requiring it to show per 100g.",2020-09-30 15:37:27

Pretty much all art is just tax evasion. Always wondered how suddenly a ""no name"" became famous? Guess what it's not a coincidence, and nobody but the artist himself would believe in his talent.

Get a work done by a no-name artist. Cheap work, little expenses, let's say 1000$. Now suddenly he becomes famous and well respected. Surprise, it was part of the plan. Now gift the art to a museum because you are a good person. 🤭

Well now you have gifted 10.000.000$ in tax deductibles. You can subtract that from your earnings.

There are entire museums built around this construct. You have to make it believable. One way is to have three expert options, but this is newbies work. Better to control the museums. Have stupid people really believe your art has value, upkeep the myth and you can even have public talks how you are a investor in young and talented people. 🤣

Here is short article https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/business/art-collectors-gain-tax-benefits-from-private-museums.html

There was a guy who really started with this and became a public figure. He gave great talks about ""art"". And the first to built his own museum to have a strong position against tax audits. It's ""neutral expert opinion based value"" 🤡",2021-06-14 14:30:50

And the answer is the continual protectionism shielding the ""haves"" from effective competition - from construction to ISP's to pharma. Which is to say - what happened with Georgia is a symptom of a far deeper and far longer reaching issue. 

Because the American Dream™ is no longer about living a productive, comfortable life. It's about acquiring as much wealth as humanly possible. That means doing whatever it takes to slow or prevent others from acquiring wealth through the same means/industry.

12eugpm,But that’s Socialism!! 🫣,2023-04-07 19:56:04
12eugpm,"I was 1 off 7 kids. My dad had a good paying job most of my life. After paying rent, utilities, and health insurance coverage on all of us, we struggled often not having food at home or lunch money for school. But my father's income wasnt considered poverty level.  

Maybe some of you can relate. Going to school, and home, and not eating for a couple of days but still expected from your parents to make good grades. Eventually I would pick up some side hustles and I'm not on the republican side because of how they voted. But I'm gonna say this. Americans are nearly as heavily taxed as any other country, whether it's on our paychecks, tolls, or at the grocery store. But we seem to be one of the few 1st world countries with a starving, malnourished, and low income population. 

I'm not on the democrat side either. But their voting base is mostly low income. And they are hugged by their representatives and loved by them and they tell their constituents that they will always find them some money so they don't have to worry about working or wanting more on a paycheck. 

Democrats want the government to take care of all of our needs. Republicans lack a moral conscience in any desire to help out those who need an occasional life line. 

So I say if you can't afford to let your kids eat at school and your food stamps can't cover their lunch for the week, your kids need to go into the system and find some parents who don't mind working a little bit more for those kids to get 3 square meals a day.

I was a hungry teenager if it weren't for my hustle I probably would have become a delinquent. Anyways y'all if I had jesus power I'd go to every school every day and multiply those lunch trays 🥰",2023-04-08 08:07:07

in the context of two comedians talking to each other on a podcast, i don't see the problem.

comedy *has* taken a huge blow from political correctness. stand up comedy has been in very large part family friendly for *awhile* now. dave chappelle's talked about this same issue a few times openly too iirc and it's been obvious to every fan of dark/crude comedy.

...and as far as the 'woke movement' types; they are not interested in hearing from straight white males. they say so and i respect that...but it is accurate to say. i always shut up when any of that stuff comes up...and i'm *for* reparations and reforming police and the whole entire prison system. 🤷‍♂️",2021-05-18 21:18:30

The only time this actually happens is when someone gives an opinion thats not relavant and wasnt asked for.

Like if you're talking about trans rights and a cis person chimes in with a bad take that no one asked for then ofc there not going to give a shit. 

Telling someone they dont have the necessary experience to have a worthwhile opinion on something isnt the same as silencing them.


Like to give a non political example:

Imagine a group of rocket scientists having a conversation about the most efficient way of getting a payload to orbit and then you or me or any other random person suggests something like ""Why dont we build a launch pad on Mt Everest so we start closer to space""

Those engineers will quite rightly tell you to shut up because you dont know what you're talking about. The same goes for social issues.",2021-05-19 02:25:19

A lot of runners wear costumes too, sometimes even coordinated as a pairing or group.

Confederate flags were a normal every day occurrence. Kids had t-shirts, belt buckles, watches, baseball hats, bumper stickers. 😡

This was also right around the time when the Malcolm X movie came out. So there were shirts and hats with the flag on it that said “you have your X and I have mine.”

So someone, presumably a white student, took down the MLK pic and replaced it with a confederate flag.  This started a weeks of race aligned after school fights.  

The teachers (mostly Black ones) launched a club called “improving cultural understanding” in order to host conversations and ease the racial tensions.  The club only had the students of color. Only 1-3 white kids ever showed up. It was only black, and the handful of non black POCs.

pyjkho,"“sue anyone that causes an unintended pregnancy”

Women don’t cause pregnancy. Men do. We just drop eggs. Men actually do the penetration and releasing of sperm. 

In this way, I don’t think that men could sue women under this law. Because men actually cause the pregnancy with an outward act. A woman’s reproductive facilities can’t accidentally make a man fertilize her egg. A woman can’t decide not to drop eggs without medical intervention (and that’s not 100%). A man CAN, however, decide not to release sperm into a woman and can choose to wear a condom as well (or abstinence?? 🤡) 

Men cause pregnancy, one way or another. Sorry dudes on Reddit, I don’t think you would be able to sue women under this law.

pyjkho,"Are you hoping people will believe you and not read the link or can you not read?

It clearly says that 40.25% of abortions take place within 6: weeks or less, and 37.5% take place between 7 and 9 weeks, so approximately 77.75% take place within 9 weeks.

But this is weeks *from* *gestation* as the note below the table explains, which means the fetus' age is actually two weeks *younger*, which means that 40.25% take place when the fetus is 4:weeks old or younger, and 77.75% take place when the fetus is 7 weeks old or younger.

At 6 weeks (or 8 weeks of gestation), which is the time limit of the Texas law, it's 66%.

But even if we assume this is above your pay grade and are having difficulty understanding the difference between weeks from gestation and fetal age in weeks and just take the numbers in the table as is and ignore the note below the table, 40.25% would be taking place before 6 weeks. That alone is a substantial percentage of abortions (almost half and the largest percentage of any time frame in the table) and proves that the claim that banning abortions after 6 weeks effectively bans abortion; that's a blatant lie.

But the figure is actually 66% if you understand that the fetal age in weeks is actually 2 weeks *less* than the number of weeks from gestation.

This is CDC data btw.

So you can cover your ears and say ""nyah nyah I can't hear you, stupid science!!"" or you can follow the science.

You're denying scientific data from the CDC that is at odds with your politics just like right wing anti-vaxxers.

uhqtof,"Don’t forget to subtract 24.65% in taxes and deductions from your paycheck. 

$14.50 X 40hr  = $580/week 

$580 X 52 weeks = $30,160/year

$30,160 X 24.65% = $7,434.44/year in deductions 

$30,160 - $7,434.44 = $22,725/year net income

~$22k per year. That’s it. At $14.50 per hour. I suppose a lot of companies have bonuses and other financial perks. But that’s just shitty. How is that a livable wage? I guess it depends on where you live but 22k/year sounds tough pretty much anywhere. I get that not everyone has the same opportunities in life but fuck…22k?!?! Sorry, I’ve just never done the math before and it hurts my brain to think i got paid EVEN LESS at my last job. Thankfully I make more than $14.50/hour at my current job but not by much.

If this were not true, they would have exceptions for things like rape, incest, viability and potential risk to the mother. 

The United States has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world, and it’s disproportionately higher for woman of color and women who live in poverty, the same people who will be disproportionately burdened by this law. 

Here is a real life example for you. My sister and her husband had been trying to get pregnant for 8 months and they finally conceived, yay! She took pregnancy tests constantly, basal temps, the whole thing. She is very well researched and careful. She found out she was pregnant at 4 weeks (like the earliest it’s possible to find out), but couldn’t get in to see a Dr until 6 weeks. Because her pregnancy is considered a geriatric pregnancy, her Dr recommend that she get all of the chromosomal tests. (Mind you, we’re already past the 6 week cut off Texas is imposing but bear with me.) She scheduled the earliest possible appointment she could (she is extremely proactive and diligent) and waited for the results. Well, the lab lost her samples, so she had to go get tested again. She got the results yesterday. She is now 15 weeks. She found out she’s a carrier for a chromosomal disease that if passed on would give the potential baby a max life expectancy of 2 years. So now her husband has to get tested (you need to get the gene from both parents because it’s recessive) but he can’t get in until Monday. Then, it takes 2-3 weeks for the test results to come back. THEN, if he ends up being a carrier (🤞🏽 that he doesn’t obviously, and it is unlikely so there’s that) they would have to do more extensive testing to determine the viability of the fetus. So now we’re talking like 20 plus weeks. 

This better not fucking happen because everyone involved would be devistated, but if it turns out that my sister’s fetus is not viable or the child won’t live past the age of 2, she may not want to go through the pain of child birth just to turn around and go through the pain of loosing a child. I wouldn’t wish that fate on my worst, anti-choice enemy, and I am hoping with everything I have that my sister will not have to make that choice either.

This kind of stuff is so common. This isn’t a unique story. These are the real choices that woman are making. Abortion is complicated and personal and something we all hope we’ll never have to think about. 
Someone who thinks a rapist’s 6 week old fetus is more valuable than the rape victim’s life doesn’t value life. Someone who thinks a woman should be forced to carry a beloved and wanted, yet unviable fetus to term, go through often dangerous and traumatic labor, only to then watch their child suffer and ultimately die does not value life. And furthermore, someone who refuses to protect themselves, their family, and their community from a deadly virus that has killed 658k Americans, devastated families, and forever altered all of our lives because the don’t want to get a safe, convenient, and free vaccine for no other reason than it “being their right” does not value life. 

Sorry for the rant. I have feelings today.",2021-09-11 02:09:42
plw43t,"**TO ALL THOSE UNVACCINATED**  
From a friends fb page—  
I  post this not to argue with people who aren’t vaccinated because I don’t argue with your posts but instead to exercise my freedom to post my beliefs too.  😀  
The vaccine it’s self is new but the technology is not and has been around for quite some time.  
I'm vaccinated and, no, I don't know what's in it - neither this vaccine, the ones I had as a child, nor in the Big Mac, or in hot dogs, or in other treatments…whether it's for cancer, AIDS, the flu, the one for polyarthritis, or vaccines for infants or children. I trust my doctor when she says it’s needed.  
I also don't know what's in Ibuprofen, Tylenol, or other meds, it just cures my headaches & my pains ...  
I don't know what's in the ink for tattoos, vaping, or every ingredient in my soap or shampoo or even deodorants.  I don’t know the long-term effect of cell phone use or whether or not that restaurant I just ate at REALLY used clean foods and washed their hands.  
In short ...  
There's a lot of things I don't know and never will…  
I just know one thing: life is short, very short,  and I still want to do something other than just going to work every day or staying locked in my home. I still want to travel and hug people without fear and find a little feeling of life ""before"".  
As a child and as an adult I've been vaccinated for mumps, measles, rubella, polio, chickenpox, and quite a few others; my parents and I trusted the science and never had to suffer through or transmit any of said diseases.  
I'm vaccinated, not to please the government but:  
\* To not get sick or die from Covid-19.  
\* To protect my family and loved ones who are unable to get vaccinated  
\* To be able to visit friends indoors and not be concerned they will be carriers and possibly infect my under 12 grandchildren.  
\*To NOT clutter a hospital bed if I get sick.  
\* To hug my loved ones  
\* To Not have to do PCR or antigenic tests to go out dancing, go to a restaurant, go on holidays and many more things to come ...  
\* To live my life and to not die before it is my time!  
\* To have kids go back to school and play sports.  
\* For Covid-19 to be an old memory.  
\* To get this Pandemic behind us and try to return to normal ASAP.  
\* To protect us.",2021-09-11 03:49:43

My family doctor, after I’d taken some time to calm down, sent me for a new ultrasound, including an internal one. It found all the fibroids that were there previously (but bigger) but now also found new polyps. You know, those things generally found that indicate possible colon cancer. So now I have a new obgyn appointment in a couple weeks. Maybe he’ll listen instead of jumping to conclusions and not let me talk.

Well Todd, your tax paying dollars are going to keeping someone locked up with no rehabilitation.. so when they get out, they have no skills to get a job, no work history for a large gap, possibly no support system, no place to stay at times and haven't learned a damn thing to stop them from going back into or deeper into a lifestyle that will cycle them BACK through the doors.

lgt9no,"Since the rise of social media ~2007, more older populations started to get on the internet. Since then, there's been a strong anti-millenial trend aimed at and coming from older generations. Just older generations blaming the new. Everything from online articles, to memes, to Fox News segments began to use millennial as a boogeyman for why the world was bad. Basically about a hundred news stories about millenials were this format: ""Millennials are hurting the _______ industry by not buying it, why are they so very stupid?""

Obviously this spawned a pushback. Baby boomers are the current top ranks in our governments and corporations, so it became easy to associate the major problems of today with their generation. For the last several years, I've seen the tables shift and ""boomer"" become to mean ""self-righteous hypocritical older person."" When OK Boomer became a meme it started a whole culture war and we saw older folks and online articles talk about it ""starting to divide generations"" and it's ageist.

vwxoc9,"Idk if I put this if y’all will hear me lol. I THINK bmw is doing this because of supply chain reasons. If they manufacture all cars with seat warmers it’s easier on their supply chain. I think sometimes we discount supply chain complexity. Having said that I think we can all agree it’s logical for BMW to charge extra for seat warmers up front when building a custom car (pretty much every car company does this). So if a customer wants a car and doesn’t want to pay extra up front for seat warmers then they do no get access to the seat warmer. HOWEVER now bmw is allowing said customers to subscribe to their seat warmers even though the refused to buy it up front. And when they do it’s actually cheaper overall for the customer because they can deactivate it during the warm months. 

This argument is assuming bmw isn’t charging extra up front for seat warmers when the vehicle is originally purchased 🙂",2022-07-12 17:27:41

6ktzx1,"Not surprised at all. I went to one of the biggest and wealthiest public school districts in Texas. I was in the first graduating class in my HS, and I took all Pre-AP or AP classes for all 4 years. I had (AT LEAST - the ones I mention are teachers I had for multiple semesters or even years that I grew pretty close to) 3 teachers that were former engineers, one that was a former software developer, and one that was a former lawyer. Many of them had some form of graduate degree, and more than a few had doctorates. 

My schools, even starting in elementary school, had a lot of money. I was in a science magnet program in middle school, and took as many STEM and engineering classes available to me in HS (ty NASA). We even had the first biotechnology lab ever in the state. There is definitely money in the Texas public education system. 

Once I came to college, I realized how lucky I was with the education that I had received. Most kids I knew weren't nearly as prepared as me, and they didn't have even a quarter of the opportunities that I was given. I talked about my STEM classes to other classmates, and I had to really help along a lot of my friends during our first semester as engineering students. We had group projects, and I would be able to finish them in 10-15 minutes, and it would takes them hours to do the half of the project, and still not be able to finish them. Not because I was any smarter that them, but because I had already been familiarized with all the subjects that we covered. The professor even stood up after our first presentation that we gave (I talked the entire time, and had only seen the slideshow twice 30 minutes before the class started), and said that it was the best presentation that he had seen from any freshman ever. And it was honestly all thanks to Mr. Schaafs, who taught me a lot of the tools needed to succeed in my field. (Shoutout to Schaafsies 😺)

I honesty wish more kids were able to get the same opportunities and education I was able to receive, and it all starts with the teachers.  If they aren't incentivized to teach, and aren't able to properly support their families with a comfortable lifestyle, then you get a backwash of unmotivated and disconnected adults that are responsible for shaping the minds of children. Teachers honestly deserve so much more for all that they do. ",2017-07-02 20:39:40

agpslw,"It’s the state of the union.  Every president does it every year.  They aren’t afraid of Trump lying, they are afraid of him being able to speak directly to the people, rather than have the media interpret it and tell the people what to think about it.  He didn’t lie about anything during his last prime time speech , but the two dim witts still got behind their one podium and robotically repeated what was on the prompter in front of them.

So what if he does lie?  People should be able to determine if something is legit or not.  CNN will definitely have their fact checking army reviewing every word out of his mouth, so if he lies it makes him look bad.  It’s funny that you Dems say that Trump and his supporters are fascists, yet liberals are the ones trying to prevent the elected leader of our nation from speaking directly to the citizens.  It’s unbelievable 

I don’t like the fact that things like what I’m about to say can happen, but you can’t stop them.  Let’s say that he does spew out a bunch of lies during his speech.  Let’s also imagine that he lied about everything during the campaign in 2016.  The people still elected him, and whether continue to support him (even if they know that he lies a lot), it doesn’t matter.  Unless he commits perjury, he is still supported by those who elected him.  If he lies and people don’t care, it doesn’t matter.  He would still be the elected choice of the people.  All politicians lie by the way, it isn’t just Trump.

I don’t like the idea of people continuing to support officials no matter what he or she does.  A lot of people would still support him if it was proven that he personally collided with Russia.  Even if a elected official does something that you or I think is wrong and unbecoming of someone in their position, it doesn’t matter if the majority of citizens don’t give a shit and re-elect him anyway (unless it is an impeachable criminal offense).  The people choose who represents them.

You know what they are actually scared of?  They know that Trump is inviting the family members of Americans who were murdered by illegal immigrants.  Once people see that and realize that it could be their daughter, their brother, or their best friend who gets killed by a criminal who shouldn’t even be here, the wall will go up faster than a rocket.  Democrats don’t want people to hear and see the truth, because they know it will crush them.  

We don’t need the democrats to “protect” us from politicians.  They think that only they are wise enough to determine what we see and hear is laughable.  They think that they are so smart, and that they know what is best for the rest of the world.  Lol, they can go fuck themselves.  They know that their time is limited, so they are going all out on a win it all or lose it all strategy.  The Kavanaugh think was a perfect example of this.  They tried every little scumbag tactic in the democrat playbook.  “I’m afraid of flying , but I can travel all over the world for vacation.”  😂 They delayed every as long as possible, and would make new excuses/demands when the previous one expired.  The democrats are all in, and they are about to be completely destroyed.  ",2019-01-17 18:13:37

It may not be ""censorship"" per se, but definitely controlling a conversation thru feel good marketing.  Companies don't give a s*** about us The government doesn't seem to and everyone that's in any kind of financial straits right now is going to be continually pushed further and further towards insolvency. 

>Ugh again, the examples that come to mind are the tech companies censoring nutjobs and then I'm just defending people you guys hate.
>


We could all point to the popular self policing tech companies that censor right-wing speech online and ""destroying"" the public squares they each built and control under terms agreed to by each account.  

But that is a non-starter. same people getting censored are fairly extreme in most cases and they tend to agree with the fact that the second amendment and the first amendment are by definition the most important things and that belong to every citizen of the United States.  If they don't like codified regulations as much as I hate them for oil and military contractors, (see EPA, FDA, SEC etc...) And believe in the free market and market forces pushing and pulling enforcing unwanted companies out and creating space for new similar platforms that are innovative around what they believe instead of bitching about getting kicked off the only public square they think that they'll have any voice in.  Maybe that's just the community and the louder group of voices saying to those individuals that that speech isn't welcome here in this public square.  Whether or not it means left or right doesn't matter because they are protected under the first amendment because corporations are considered persons.  

On the flip side...

Our actual United States president expects that he can exploit a free platform which is used for free marketing for himself to attack in the public square every and all political candidate that he can, claiming whatever he wants to with impunity and expects to not be disciplined because he's the president and he can do what he wants.  Getting flagged by informative post by the platform is not censoring him at all, yet we're being conditioned or attempted to be conditioned into thinking that double speak or double think is just fine.  

Tech companies are just capitalists too... I would be mad at them for being data harvesting tools for direct marketing and building of algorithms, especially tik tok and the parent company's little A.I. project (shit same with Google). 

I don't know, I don't really have an answer for you but it seemed like you were vaguely saying that the tech companies are the only ones that have corporate censorship.  


Whatever 😕


Full disclosure I'm a felon (nonviolent drug conviction) who can't vote and and that fact makes me pretty upset every time that I realize that I don't even have a voice to do that....

I quit Facebook and Twitter about 6 months ago for the last time because it doesn't even matter what's on there anymore it's all b*******.

What if he’s not a crazy religious nut bag, but he read the jury, and could tell they are. 

He knows the person on trial is innocent, but the trial has gone poorly for the defendant. 

The judge can’t stand to see another innocent person go to prison in Texas under his watch, so he pulls a “Hail Mary”. Saves a generous portion of that person’s life. 

Then, he reports himself.

And knows he has at least one freebie - because he knows his audience… 

Far fetched, but that’s my “hopeful” conspiracy theory. 

I think too few judges show any kind of “judgement” or mercy. And while I completely disagree with what he did, and I think he should be removed… I’m hoping this was a case of a good man/bad judge. 🙏",2024-05-21 02:00:12

There were special relationship between two Democratic Senate Candidates of Georgia and the communist countries are to be exploded  
Source:6 park--Zilan12/11/2020

In the past two days, the news that Rep. Eric Swalwell, a member of the Intelligence Committee of the American Congress, has been infiltrated by a female Chinese spy, has become a hot topic. On the 9th, two Democratic candidates were simultaneously exploded in connection with communist countries.  


📷

A report by the US media ""Liberty Beacon"" revealed that one of Georgia’s Democratic senator candidates, Jon Ossoff’s father---- millionaire Richard Ossoff, commissioned a Chinese shipyard in 2008. ""Jie Teng Shipbuilding factory"" built a yacht for him, and during the trial trip of this yacht, many CCP dignitaries participated. According to a press release found by the media that has been deleted, those who participated in the sea trial included Guangdong province government's leaderships. Many dignitaries, deputy governors and bureau leaders of the province and Zhuhai city, including forty more people. ""Liberty Beacon"" stated that in addition to the above-mentioned yachts that link the Ossoff family with the Chinese Communist Party, Jon Ossoff himself has a film company, Insight TWI, which has connections with the Chinese Communist Media Company. In the past two years, the film company has at least received funding from PCCW, which is supported by the Chinese Communist Party. Moreover, Jon did not disclose this amount in the financial report, but he quietly added this part of the financial report in a later revised document.

Another Georgian Democratic senator candidate Raphael Warnock was also revealed by the public for a period of his history. He clearly expressed his praise to the Cuban Communist dictator Castro. According to a video, when Castro died in 2016, Warnock said in a public place that Castro's history was ""very complicated"", just like the history of the United States is very complicated. However, in November this year, Warnock denied what he had said on CNN. In response to the host’s question, ""Do you understand why people are shocked by praising Castro?"" Warnock said, ""Of course, I have never praised it. I promoted American values ​​in this campaign... Proud of my country"". Currently, Ossoff and Warnock are challenging two current Republican Senators Perdue and Loeffler. If the Republican Party wins another two seats, it will be become the majority party in the Senate.

They actually do have facial recognition and they can find all of the photos of you taken in the park even if they don't scan your band. 

They even tested a Google glass kind of thing so the workers would know based on the info on your band if it was your birthday or something just by looking at you. (So they could great you with ""happy anniversary"" or ""happy birthday"")

They're supposedly the special ones who ""answers to God,"" so they're supposedly the authority (and I just found out that the word history for ""swear"" relates to ""answer""!). Meanwhile, I really applaud all of the atheistic and secular resources that gives awareness to how cults work, but I think it'd also benefit Christian communities to have Christian resources on cult awareness as well (and to the edgelords that say all religions are cults, I'm talking about the ones that fit the BITE model 😛).

*Korbel Champagne Cellars is a winery based in Guerneville, California. Since 1882, Korbel has primarily manufactured California champagne, using the méthode champenoise process. In this process, sparkling wine is fermented inside the same bottle from which it is served…*

*Korbel has been a producer of fine California méthode champenoise champagnes for 140 years"". Korbel has scrupulously followed regulations – both in letter and in spirit - regarding use of the word “champagne” on wines made in and marketed in the United States, regulations established by the U.S. Department of Treasury in the 1930s. These regulations allow U.S. producers to use names of geographical significance that also designate a class or type of wine. Such names – like champagne, sherry and port - are called semi-generics, and may be used on labels only in direct conjunction with an appropriate appellation of origin (place in the United States where the grapes were grown) and only on wines that conform to the standard of identity for that class or type.*

*In 2006, all 27 EU-member countries, including France, signed the Bilateral U.S.-EC Trade Agreement on Wine reaffirming this right. This Agreement takes the laws of all involved nations into account, halts the development and use of new brands with semi-generic terms by U.S. wineries, while protecting U.S. producers – such as Korbel – who have made substantial long term investments in trademarks, brand names and marketing of their products.*

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

pdvtpi,"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.",2021-08-29 23:23:28

As Americans we get this idea that the food and recipes are diluted or culturally appropriated by Americans, when really it's just some savvy Chinese-Americans who know their audience.

Funny note, my manager totally thought I knew Chinese because I have a tendency to repeat words as replies, so I would often say ""sure, sure"" very quickly, which I guess sounded like ""thank you"" in Chinese to her.

jcyacw,"As a Chinese-American, I was surprised! My family and I mostly abhor Americanized Chinese food, though I occasionally enjoy beef chow mein :) still, I'd rather eat authentic Chinese food ANY day.

But many Chinese-Americans do love American Chinese food! I think we just prefer it be acknowledged as its own cuisine, and not lumped in or generalized as what all Chinese food is like! Even within Chinese cuisine, every province/major city has a completely different flavor and cuisine of its own. So if you say ""Chinese food"", about 5-10 different cuisines come to mind for me. Of course, I think every culture's fare operates this way, but I've noticed in the US it's pretty accepted that Sichuan, Shanghai, Hunan, and Cantonese cuisine are almsot entirely different than one another - and restaurants might label themselves as such.

Similarly, I've read that there's a market for American Chinese food among locals in China, esp among the younger generation. 😊again, to many, it is a totally different but good-on-its-own entity.",2020-10-17 18:55:30

One conservative claimed women were bragging about having multiple abortions an the government paying for it or whatever 🙄. 
 
I checked the actual stats and I think it's something like 7% of women who have abortions end up having 3 or more abortions of the course of the period of their life before menopause.
Not a super low number but still got the jist that they really think they need to punish women who 'avoid the consequences of sexual intercourse' because that is just so evil and ignorant of those women.

I would also guess that maybe she bought some of her followers or did something to gain them but they don’t necessarily care about her “brand” I see so many people I follow on Instagram promoting or trying to sell products and I never buy anything 🤷🏻‍♀️,2019-05-31 04:57:10

Dr. Seuss company decided, on their own, to stop additional printing of 6 books. Nobody else was asking for it. Somehow that equates to the ""left's agenda of cancel culture"".

Hasbro decided maybe it was time to update their branding. That is very common in long running companies, even McDonald's has changed their branding focuses and we don't have the iconic Hamburgler or Ronald McDonald pictures, so why did this become ""a leftist agenda""?

Now on to Pepe, where WB said they no longer wish to have his character appear in any additional new programming. You guessed it...now there is a controversy of ""cancelling"" a time honored cartoon.

Now, the people that need to agree with your comment are not going to want to listen, because in their minds, even *if* it was that the Chicks decided on their own to change their name, they still will not correlate to what the rage is now, because the Chicks were completely fair game (bonus points if they bring up that celebrities should not be making political stands publicly anyway. 🤦) and deserved to ""let the free market decide if they survive"".",2021-03-11 23:07:58

11op22n,"They had to adjust thier previous findings due to inflation. $0 - 75K was the range for a while. Basic ""comfort"" and ""security"" isn't available at $75k anymore. ... But the trickiness isn't about the money. It's that *inflation lowers the cost of labor* across the board as well; think about it. No employee gets paid enough. Wage inflation is the most effed up term I ever heard of.

But, back to it. In fuzzy math theory in 2022 $81750.00 became the new $75000.00 (that's 9% less). If a person didn't get a raise to match inflation their labor only earned them $64750.00. 

But in reality that's accumulative thing that happens whether the inflation rate is 2% or 9%, so each year labor is being compensated at a lower rate. Yeah think about that for a sec.
(Is somebody wants to get all mathy on that and stretch it out go ahead, please).

So if the Joneses wage is match inflation and yours don't you end up sad. The landlord has price control and raises the rents to maintain and support his or her goals and lifestyle; while your wages become worth less and less. You were confused on why your smile was turning upside down it was because you're grin supporting ~$75k became ~$64,750.00 and the same amount of Labor and time away from home and recreation was expected nonetheless. 🤯

Did your teleprompter fail? Just kidding my friend 🙂

I do think it was clearly his teleprompter failing, which is totally reasonable. But pointing out when the president misspeaks is pretty par for the course as far as news goes. I also think that he in general is clearly a much worse public speaker than Obama ever was, and more importantly Obama went back and clarified his point, acknowledging that he misspoke.

Then I realized wait, holidays are a major point of contention for divorcees. Then I got annoyed, Amber Alert was invented in honor of a raped and murdered child. That is what its for. This was just some kid that overstayed just a little bit on Christmas at dads and royally pissed off mom. Thanks mom. I got to think of rape and murder on Christmas because your ex is salty and wants more time with his son and you made it OUR business 👍. I turned on the evening news and I was right. Son returned for Christmas dinner. He was supposed to be returned DIRECTLY after Santa's presents or some shit. Fucking dumb.


TL;DR, Most Amber Alerts are stupid custody disputes. But their bullshit bitching about unfairness and missing their kid and paying to miss their kid (child support) is NONE of my business, or YOURS. Its in honor of a MURDERED child. That's what its for. I don't have time for the other thing. ""Domestic Kidnapping"" I was told we don't do that in Oregon. This happened in Missouri.

I know an excellent 1st grader who was up until recently qualified and tested into the GT program in kindergarten. Their mother was the sole custodian for 6 years as she had escaped an attempted family homicide with the child.

The dad/ husband lost his shit and grabbed a gun and held them all hostage for hours. The mom was stopped by the guy from calling the police, and they were rural, so neighbors couldn't hear the screams. She literally did everything possible to not die with her kid when it happened. 

The guy just went from supervised visitation only and 0 legal and 0 physical custody in a blue state custody order, to the kid being forced to experience 50/50 custody with the unstable father. The mom spent over 70k on the best lawyer in the huge Texas city, and they said ""there is no way that they will continue supervised visitation in Texas, you should have moved while you could.""

Now, the mom cannot even move with the child from the state of Texas, because the unstable guy says no. 

Fuck the nonsense of ""parental (ownership) rights"" in Texas.",2022-07-15 05:18:43

At the McDonald’s drive thru I ordered my usual black coffee. The lady bluntly said “a what”? I repeated myself….she gave me cream and sugar with a whisper of coffee. One of those minor inconveniences yet it somehow felt super passive aggressive?

The kindest thing I can think is that it was just an order mix up or maybe they had some premade drinks they needed to offload. Maybe she didn’t know what black coffee is or got offended?

The government should have stepped in and heavily punished these companies when they all started jacking them up during covid when people gave them leeway because of ""supply chain disruptions"" *and then never decreased prices when those logistical issues were solved*. They created inflation by increasing prices only to turn around and buyback shares to increase share price and line the pockets of their executives.

How are you suppose to ""vote with your feet and wallet"" when prices are controlled (and increased) by a few mega corporations that are all on earnings calls bragging about how they're adjusting prices due to ""market conditions and responding to their competitors tactics"" and to expect astronomical growth in the stock?

Bust these companies up. Actually punish the suppliers for gouging and colluding on meat prices. Punish fast food corps for forcing you to use apps to get any reasonable price while they're selling your data on the side for $$$.

You can push back as a consumer if you want, but it's pointless unless it's part of an organized campaign. This shit happens at the top level, and the government are the ones who need to step in.

Everyone assumed the movie was like the book and celebrated military fascism, but the reality was that it showed the humans as arrogant, incapable of recognizing forms of life that were too different, and comically caricaturized.

The football jock pro chasing his new love, the complete lack of empathy when the lead's friend sends him to certain death, etc. 

Two of the most on the nose parts might be when the paraplegic is gushing how the marines made him the man he is today, right before the camera pans to his double amputation, and the humans celebrating the knowledge that the captured enemy leader can feel pain and fear -- right before cutting to a clip of the humans carving it up and torturing it, with even more glee than the brain-bug had when killing humans.

q1y386,"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.",2021-10-05 18:56:51

cchtja,"I've tried my best to understand the economic libertarian stance, and I think I've come quite a distance. A lot of it boils down to principles. After all, if someone I don't know will have money ""stolen"" from them to give to someone I don't know, then I can only operate on the golden rule: How would I want to be treated in that person's shoes? What principles do I want applied to my situation?

The people who think this genuinely believe that because taxes must be enforced by armed police and prison time, that it's a form of legalized theft. And that is true, if you stop thinking there. That the government is an inherently untrustworthy group and you'll be better off with a mutual ""live and let live"" attitude towards and from them. The problem is a few things. First, the power of money is more than the sum of its parts; a billion dollars is more powerful than just a billion one dollars. Also, the issue is that yes, you can defang the government, but this doesn't delete its power, it creates a power vacuum. And if you were afraid of unchecked, unstoppable power, then just wait until businesses effectively fill the shoes that government left behind. You may only have one vote for president, but you have zero votes on an average board of directors. 

[A video I saw](https://youtu.be/ZbjSeBOP-MA) went over the three main kinds of fairness (in regards to fighting games, but it fits here too), and libertarianism is the idea that ""deservedness"" is the most important type of fairness. It assumes that those in power must have earned it, because no one was giving anything away to anyone, so to disrupt this house of cards is immoral, since you'd be taking away something that someone earned and giving it to someone who didn't. 

Granted, I believe that calculated love and compassion is the answer. It's not wrong to give people a booster seat in a degree, because they'll make more money than before, and generate more tax revenue; they'll pay back in what they took out. Same with crippling medical debt, if medical care is cheaper for everyone, than everyone can not only live a happier life, but also be productive for longer, thus refunding that cost. 

I've rambled long enough. If anyone has any specific questions, I'll do my best to answer them from the perspective of a belief system I don't think is correct. This'll go over very well, I'm sure 🤡. 

Tl;Dr it's more complicated than ""that man bad, me man good"". It can be hard to empathize with, and truly try to understand, people you know you already disagree with vehemently. But if everyone deliberately chooses to not understand each other, then how can we communicate? Beliefs can often look caustic to you, when you came to your conclusion by a totally different path of logic than someone else.",2019-07-13 03:10:27

When Americans say they say ""Oh I don't want socialised/free healthcare"" they're really just saying ""I want corporations to benefit from the government spending the money and not the people"". Libertarians and conservatives may deny it and say ""blah blah blah but in *theory*"", but the truth is, it isn't working in practice. 

Corporations getting billions of dollars instead of the public getting billions of dollars is the reality they have but those in favour of the current system are under the illusion that the policies that got them into this mess are the policies that'll get them out.

Between 1961 and 2016 (five Presidents from each party), Republican administrations scored eighteen times more individuals and entities indicted (126) thirty-eight times more convictions (113), and thirty-nine times more individuals who had prison time (39) that Democrats (7 indictments, 3 convictions, 1 prison sentence).

Notice how I ended it at 2016. That’s because I didn’t want to skew the record by adding the Trump administration, which is the absolute record holder for all three stats.

Handle it in a calm and professional manner my butt 😂. What did they seriously expected? To let a unknown aerial vehicle just fly over their bases or other important building? I’m surprised the Americans didn’t shoot it with a missile and then aim at China (assuming their rockets can get there. I am not following warfare tech at all)

Implementing a simple string match to identify bad words is a relatively small task, but implenting a grammar engine to understand context and profanity is a massive task that requires a huge amount of man hours. The devs would only do what is asked of them.

The real issue here is that they filter what message you can put on a cake.  So what if someone wants ""Pokey Bumwank O'Clock"" in perrywinkle blue icing? It's their cake. It invites people to try and flout the rules - when someone enters ""smash mesh itbox"" it goes through, then what happens? The underpaid confectioner will still raise it with their superior and the cake won't get made. That right there shows there's a process for dealing with objectionable content, you don't need the profanity filter on the site and you shouldn't be so sensitive to words other people think are funny, even when they're clearly not.

My lizard brain wants to sum the whole debate up to an argument over when people believe life starts. Religious people might say it starts in heaven before sex even happens. Can of worms, anyone? That would make masturbation and sex for pleasure pretty bad. ✅ and ✅. Scientists may say when the brain starts working or birth or when the fetus can survive without life support. So, what then about assisted suicide when brain function diminishes? I believe it's at self awareness, but I don't have a way to measure that, so fall back to birth or brain acknowledging that I could be wrong and that a fetus could potentially be self aware.

If pro-lifers approached this logically they might put way more money into birth control and detecting pregnancy before they think the miracle happens. Probably most are religious though.",2019-04-10 18:20:32

syf68a,"More understandable back then I guess, but I'm continuously amazed by how police continue to use this as an effective threat and lie about the results, pretending its smoking gun evidence in interrogation. Media still perpetuates the myth that it works and a lot of people seem to believe it. 

They get a lot of false or just pragmatic confessions by lying about forensic evidence and pretending they're screwed when they ""failed"" (even if they pass) the so called lie detector test. Not mentioning it's inadmissible in court, and the cops know it's just a lie to get people to confess. ""We know everything we have your DNA and eyewitness and you failed the lie detector. You've been here 16 hours straight don't you wanna go home? Just sign."" Everything from the position of your chair and room layout and other psychological techniques are designed to break you down. 

The guy who used to be one of the top experts and administrators of lie detector test later revealed it's all a scam and worked for years to get it abolished, and then went around teaching people how to beat it. 

In short, the trick is clenching your asshole. Seriously. It only measures your vitals / signs of stress and you can fool it by clenching / relaxing your asshole during the baseline / actual questions. Lots of videos where they teach a group of people how to beat it in 5 to 10 minutes with various simple methods.

TLDR: If you find yourself being questioned or in an interrogation room, no matter how friendly they are your only words should be ""lawyer."" And no it doesn't make you look guilty or hurt your chances, the police just really don't want you to because it hurts their chance of conviction. No matter what they tell you: lawyer. Don't give them a single sentence.


---

**Edit and links**: here's an article on the former polygraph expert turned anti polygraph activist. Apparently nowadays he says using mental imagery works even better than clenching your asshole (relaxing at the beach during the relevant questions and imagining your greatest fear during the control / baseline questions). Concept is pretty simple though. 

Relies on that baseline / control to compare to, so if you raise your vitals and make yourself nervous during the questions like ""what's your name"" and ""have you ever lied"" etc, it fucks up the whole A/B comparison when you relax yourself during the ""Are you a serial killer teaching people how to beat a polygraph on reddit?"" 

*envisions puppies and a sunrise*
No of course not!

(👁 ͜ʖ👁)

But regardless of the method, you still have to practice spiking your vitals during relevant questions and remaining calm during relevant questions, without creating such a huge discrepancy that it's obvious or countermeasures are noticed.

It's like something out of an epic sci-fi saga, with Ukraine scoring a victorious breakthrough while a real-life clash of rival Russian forces unfolds! This seriously fits right into the epic plot twists and grand battles we daydream about when delving into fantastical space adventures. It's as if our cherished imprints from authors like Asimov, Herbert, or Ender's Game manifested in reality, taking us on an adrenaline-fueled rollercoaster. We've got Ukraine, armed with remarkable guerrilla tactics, outmaneuvering the notorious Wagner Group and their mystical backer Prigozhin. It's legit sending shivers down our spines! So, grab that bowl of hyper-space popcorn, buckle up, and let's witness the unfolding drama unfold together. May the force be with Ukraine as they dive headfirst into this captivating interstellar battlefield. Here's hoping this headline will inspire countless thrilling sci-fi novels, stories, and maybe—just maybe—an actual vision for a united future across our pale blue dot.

Prigozhin’s fucky wucky was not leaving Ukraine and taking his boys to Africa.

mhk1z5,I knew a guy in jail who used his identical twin brothers name when he was arrested. Only to learn his brother was wanted on more serious charges. Then tried to explain he lied and took over a year to get it believed. Only to learn his twin had died almost two years prior. (Lived in different states and his twin died on a Reservation. Native Americans) So he was then charged with his original crimes. Got sentenced and added charges for giving false information added to his charges. Would have done half the time he ended up doing if he’d just told truth at the beginning. Even tried using his brothers Vietnam service record to get his charges reduced. He was illiterate so I’d help him write up his requests to court and his lawyer as part of church outreach.  Tried multiple times to tell him to just tell the truth but he was much smarter than the lawyers. 🙄,2021-04-01 04:02:11

imepxy,"It is so stupid to categorize an eating disorder by BMI and not eating habits. Just because you are not underweight doesn’t mean someone can’t die from a vitamin or mineral deficiency. Ie potassium. I had problems with eating in high school but I was an Athlete and had enough muscle to put me at a healthy BMI. Even tho I would eat 2 eggs with plain salad for breakfast and a medium Carmel macchiato for lunch and play soccer for 3 hours every day. I started to get jaundice and I got torticollis and a blood lab showed I was dangerously deficient in almost every vitamin and nutrient. ✨bUt I wAsNt UnDeRwEiGhT ✨ so I wasn’t that bad right? 

I remember getting a California roll at sushi with friends and I only ate half. I would be “too busy” talking to finish so I would take the rest to go. I saved so much money on food tho",2020-09-04 18:18:06

imepxy,"I broke my arm when I was 8. My mum said that since I could move my fingers it clearly wasn’t broken (I guess she was trying to calm me down, but I knew perfectly well it was broken because I HEARD the snap and she wasn’t with me at that moment).

However, since she’s not a medical professional, she took me to the hospital, where the medical professionals determined it was, in fact, broken and they treated me.

It’s scary that the medical professionals in your case were the ones who were as silly as my non medically trained mother! 😞",2020-09-05 03:53:45
imepxy,"This. It is SO unhealthy for us with ED's to be told how thin we are. Comments on our bodies can have drastic effects. Me personally, I took it as 'what I'm doing is working so I'll keep on doing it'.

I was also told I wasn't thin enough because I had an absolute bitch of a doctor who misweighed me by 3kg, even though I was bulimic purging type THEN TOLD ME MY WEIGHT WHEN I ASKED NOT TO KNOW. 'Well due to your weight, you can't possibly have an eating disorder', I feel awful for any girl who went in to see her in regards to this. Another doctor weighed me properly and was extremely understanding, referred me to a clinic but then covid happened 🤸🤸 to be honest, I feel like I'm getting a hold of it, it's super hard and I have a lot of slip ups, I'm staying hopeful until I can get some professional help.

Most of the time it feels like we're all suffering alone through this shit, and it sucks. A lot of people have a direct cause or moment as to why they developed this disorder. Myself, it was my dad being absent and my parents being shitty and controlling, so I did what I could to have some control, and a friend of mine who has had a similar upbringing does the opposite and eats to fill that void she has. It's just two sides of the same coin just different extremes.

We've got this though, I believe. I believe in everyone out there with these shitty disorders, we can get better. Sounds so cliche, but we have to learn to love ourselves, and I think that's the hardest part.",2020-09-04 16:11:01

Yup. I used the laxatives because I found that I couldn’t make myself vomit. Very little gag reflex apparently. The discovery that starvation induced vomiting seemed a cruel sort of irony heh.

Most of the 'minimum wage' jobs people bring up arent even minimum wage. Walmart starts you at 10....the only places I know that are minimum wage are warehouse jobs where you work 12 hours a day making jack shit. 


Also I know the biggest difference is the hours. Most McDonald's, Walmart, etc. Workers probably don't get 40 hours a week, while warehouse workers probably get 40 if not some overtime. (I currently work for a logistics company so I started out making 8 driving a van but now get 11 as a quality checker and 2nd in command of my area).

Re: Slavery

Same type of broken BS thinking - The black man was not built by god to be a thinking type of creature, and left to their own they are exceedingly lazy, too lazy to achieve anything in life or even take good care of themselves and their people. That's why the black man craves the strong leadership of the True God's Children™ , the white folks that can show them the way.

But because blacks are dumb and lazy, you can't just give them ideas. The only way to help them is to force them to work by using violence. So slavery was very good for them because it means their white masters are putting them in chains and showing them the way, helping them see the value and joy of a good work day. Some were able to learn the value of 18hrs hard labor every day.

That's when the blacks were their happiest. There are many stories that at the end of the day, when they were allowed to go back to their slave huts to wash their wounds, some would be heard singing group songs to their nightly supper. That's how you know they were enjoying the good life.

Until the damn liberals had to come over and force freedom upon these poor misunderstood people. The True Patriots ™ even took up arms and fought for the blacks right to remain enslaved, but ultimately the damn liberals won that fight, and then the blacks were forced to have to fend for themselves in life instead of enjoying the graceful care of their masters.

That's why blacks today can still be seen not quite enjoying all the benefits of our modern society. Because the True Patriots™ than once tried to help them remain enslaved, continued to try to help them by preventing them from receiving education or building successful communities, in hopes that they would remain impoverished to encourage them to maybe request to be enslaved again.

But so far the blacks haven't been smart enough to ask to be enslaved again. So on we go, denying them opportunities, education, social equality, until they savvy up. it's been hard work to keep the black man down for their own benefit, but conservatives are nothing if not selfless people, and are willing to continue this important work for future generations yet.",2021-01-24 00:29:18

l3kc18,"Yes. 

He is literally saying white people are more competent than black people. 

I really can’t see another way to interpret it.

Edit: I’m getting a load of comments disagreeing. So here’s an elaboration. 

They way I see there are two ‘kind’ ways to interpret this sentiment but I still feel they are flawed. 

1.) he acknowledges that black teenagers are at an educational disadvantage and thus won’t be able to compete with white applicants. 

Ok fair enough, but we’re talking about raising the _minimum_ wage which is often paid to low skilled jobs anyway. A shit load of both black and white teenagers already work these jobs, so it it would be a tremendous boon to both were it lifted. 

Also the whole of this argument is predicated on the notion that driving up wages will result in fewer jobs leading to a more competitive landscape. I just don’t see how that is the case. 

We’re taking about employers who are happy to pay the bare minimum legal wage to their workers, do we really think that if they could hire less people to get a job done they wouldn’t already be doing that? 

The curse of minimum wage jobs is not only that the pay is bad, it’s that they are often catastrophically understaffed roles! You end up doing the work of multiple people as it is. So the fewer jobs argument doesn’t stand up for me 🤷🏼‍♂️

2.) he acknowledges racial prejudice exists in employers and that driving up the cost of the workforce at the ground level with further   disincentivize hiring of black teenagers. 

Okay maybe that’s true yeah.",2021-01-24 09:00:01

sj1cxg,"From a comment below, ""I know Reddit loves to shit on the church and Christians..."".

This is true😕

But honestly, this sort of sacrificial service to the community is what 90% of Christian Churches do. I've been a pastor for a couple of decades in multiple areas of the country, and this is the sort of thing that is going on all over, all of the time.  Its the other 10% of idiots and radicals that get the press and the public attention.

A recent Gallup study determined that approx. 80% of the worlds complete benevolent work is done by Christian churches, organizations or individuals. That's 80% of hospitals, clinics, disaster relief, medical aid, financial aid, homeless benevolent work, schools and colleges, etc.  That sort of work doesn't get done by crazy, megolomaniac, self serving ""Christians""...just us normal.people trying hard to reflect the love and character of Jesus.

More power to this church! I hope they DO continue to find ways to feed the hungry, despite the ordinance.   S.D.G.",2022-02-03 16:55:45

According to the above source, which is a pretty reliable one, given its an actual public university created by law in Florida for materials science:

>For example: If you have 10 pCi/g of radium in a gram of phosphogypsum, less than one radium atom transforms per minute per billion-trillion atoms that make up gypsum, which is almost all calcium sulfate.

So, if the substance is perfectly fine for farmers to put in soil that needs a calcium additive, and we are perfectly fine with every day household objects producing more radiation exposure to people than this stuff does, and a large portion of the rest of the world already uses this stuff in industrial applications, then probably its okay to put in roads here too 🤷‍♂️

>This is why the radium is often referred to as a “trace” impurity in the gypsum.

Further, we use household products that emit more radiation than this stuff. Here is a [non exhaustive list](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/health-risks-safety/radiation/everyday-things-emit-radiation.html) of household radiation emitting objects from the canadian government, that contain radioactive materials in greater abundance than what we're talking about with this gypsum.

He also uses that moniker to pay homage to the real Margarida - [Jorge José Emiliano dos Santos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Jos%C3%A9_Emiliano_dos_Santos) - who was one of the first openly gay Brazilian referees and is apparently an iconic figure of Brazilian football. Unfortunately he died due to aids related complications.

wrnl2q,"I say this with all the love and respect I can muster for native Pennsyltuckians. Having spent some time amongst the people of that great... area of land defined by political boundaries, and having visited Mechanicsburg (two years as an LDS, aka Mormon missionary. So sorry for the things I said when I was Mormon; shout out to r/exmormon), the subject of this article is surprisingly literate, all things considered.  

Talk about a travesty of education, rural Pennsylvania is not great... but boy howdy do they have some of the best high school football fields I've ever stepped foot on.  

Also, most of rural Pennsylvania doesn't seem to have experienced the recession in 2008. You're probably thinking, 'oh how wonderful.' Nope you're wrong, this is a result of being stuck in The Great Depression... in many more ways than one. Wonderful people and great food though.  

Random advice I learned knocking doors as a missionary out there, don't do it if you happen to be commiting the great offense of having too much melanin in your skin for the locals, especially not after the sun goes down. 
  
I digress, the most important thing I came to say is that ""35 acre shire"" is right banging for a renaissance faire. The food alone is worth requesting the time out of house arrest for. I'm glad the judge in this request understood the gravity and life or death situation she was in. 

I am, of course, mosdef not speaking from experience regarding this renaissance fair. I was a good peter priesthood type missionary and would never ever break mission rules. I  wouldn't want to lose blessings from ~~Supply Side~~ Mormon Jesus or disappoint my sky daddy.

Tangentially related - Back when I worked in restaurants I once got in an argument with a male cook who denied the existence of a hood over the clitoris. 

Someone was talking about piercings, and he asserted there's only one kind of clit piercing. According to him there is no such thing as a clitoral hood, so a hood piercing is nonsense. He walked away still convinced that I was wrong 🤦🏻‍♀️

If I were to give my opinion, I feel like the Reddit mob might downvote me to oblivion. Oh well, I’m a small government conservative, no not that type of conservative that hates trans people and want to ban books, etc.

I’m the type that doesn’t trust the government to ever do anything correctly so I don’t want them to run any big program. Because corruption and stupidity will make it worst.

However, I’m not some “free market solves all” Libertarian either. I think we need to utilize the market more but can’t fully get away from government intervention. We can only reduce it.

If I had my way, I would put funding on grants and loans towards trade school. Basically people would pay next to nothing toward trade schools to become an electrician, plumber, welder, etc.

And yes people will hate me and I’m sure there would be protests but if you don’t go into a high potential earning major (example: medical, law, engineering) your loans that you get will be harder to get approved. 

I don’t want people to be stopped from getting higher education but I feel like 18 year olds just don’t know enough about what they want to do. They then rack up loans on low income majors of switch majors several times. 

Maybe incentivize waiting for college as well, maybe make loans easier to get when you are older and harder to get when you are younger.

Colleges are taking advantages of kids that know very little about the real world. They increase tuition and expect the tax payer to foot the bill. If we can encourage kids to delay college maybe a few years or encourage them to become tradesmen and tradeswomen, the colleges have no choice but to adapt and lower their prices. 

That would be my plan if I was in any position of power. Is it perfect? No. But it lowers government involvement somewhat (compared to giving free college) and pushes pressures on the more guilty parties, the colleges.",2023-03-06 21:26:53

qehj9s,"I used to work at Starbucks. I loved the job and the benefits, but the customers were just awful. So incredibly mean spirited and there were a few who made me cry - I’m not a crier! So yeah, $8.20 an hour to be yelled at, cussed out, understaffed, and stressed out? Nah. I’m self employed now but if I got laid off at Starbucks and then realized how good life can be when I’m not being under paid and screamed at over bean water, I probably wouldn’t go back either. From MY experience, there are a few things that retail jobs and fast food jobs could do to attract and retain workers. 

1) Do not allow customers to verbally abuse your workers. This was the #1 reason I couldn’t handle being a barista anymore.

2) Compensate fairly, not just for the best profit margin. 

3) Follow in the footsteps of Starbucks and offer great benefits for everyone, including part timers. Tuition reimbursement, insurance, EAPs, stocks, etc. 

4) Be a good boss. Not a good corporate megaphone. My first boss at Starbucks is still the best boss I have ever had. He made working fun, kept the crew positive,  he was so innovative, and not afraid to stand up to brilliant new corporate ideas that didn’t work.  He would give it a fair shot and then go back to what worked. The numbers didn’t lie so the DMs let it slide 😂

Everyone deserves to be able to have a roof over their heads, clothes on their back, and food in their bellies without going through hell and back in an abusive environment just to barely make ends meet. Make it to where people can actually enjoy life and they will want to work.

I did 10 years in retail, 6 of it in management. I obviously have a decent amount of work experience and clearly I have proven myself to be a good enough worker to have been promoted TWICE during my tenure. I really would like to apply my skills in something other than a customer service job, but nothing has popped up. I have even tried getting my foot in the door in the interior design field since I got my college degree in that — nothing.

What’s really got me is that I did finally say “fuck it” and I applied to two separate retail management jobs and was rejected.. the kicker: both of these places sold the exact same type of merchandise my previous job did. I worked at Pier 1. Literally furniture and home decor, and with my degree I really have a shit ton of knowledge to offer. But nope.

Nowhere has even checked any of my references that they all insist I give, either.

And on the topic of the pandemic assistance boost: Regular UI is bullshit. I went from getting $920 every 2 weeks to $410 every two weeks. Which is just fucking ✨fantastic✨ ya know??

This means that a lot of on-site labor is suffering as a result, because those wfh jobs are now being filled.

If the found him living with them they could lose their benefits or worse, be forced to pay it back since that would be deemed fraud. 
I'm curious as to why their healthcare bills are 15k.
I guess maybe because all health insurance is freaking expensive. Would cost me 1,200$ a month to insure my whole family. And I still have to pay the first 5k.
All the whole insurance companies profited 7 billion recently.
I thought Obama care was supposed to reduce costs... which it didn't and wouldn't ever. That's what happens when government starts to subsidize and regulate an industry the wrong way.

Mass shooting at DC party draws new attention to problem with large gatherings during pandemic

WASHINGTON — The mass shooting of 21 people at a DC party is calling into question the issue with large gatherings during the pandemic. Some neighbors want police to do more.
DC Police Chief Peter Newsham said Sunday that hundreds gathered at the 3300 block of Dubois Place, Southeast Friday into Saturday. It defied the mayor's order to limit groups to 50 people.

The chief said it's a trend happening throughout the DMV — and unfortunately, this one ended tragically.
A 17-year-old father, Christopher Brown, was shot to death when police said at least three gunmen opened fire at around 12:20 a.m. Saturday. A female off-duty officer was also seriously injured. Chief Newsham said 19 others sustained non-life threatening injuries.
“Nobody can predict that a shooting like this is going to happen at a gathering like this, but we can’t have these large gatherings in the city,"" Chief Newsham said at a press conference Sunday.

Despite community members circulating flyers advertising the block party days before, police said organizers did not have a permit for the party.
WUSA9 reached out to confirm if the organizer had requested a permit but did not hear back Sunday.
The Mayor's COVID-19 guidelines prohibit groups larger than 50, with a possible fine of up to $1,000 for violating it.
“It’s important as a community that we have a zero-tolerance for this kind of activity,"" Mayor Bowser said Sunday.
But, when it comes to enforcement, MPD said recently it is hoping for community compliance.
Chief Newsham said they did not have enough officers to break up this party.
He did comment Sunday on a gathering from a couple of weeks ago in Oxon Run, where an ANC Commissioner said police did not intervene.
""That story has not actually been told accurately. For those who know what happened over in Oxon Run Park. There was a gathering there,"" he said. ""We were able to get sufficient police officers over there to break up that group, and that’s what we should have done here.”
The chief stressed that these gatherings are not only happening in DC.

Across the state line in Prince George's County, a mansion party prompted County Executive Angela Alsobrooks to increase penalties for groups larger than 50 to a possible year in jail and $5,000 fine.
Some community members are calling on Mayor Bowser to take a similar step.
WUSA9 reached out to the person neighbors said organized the party and did not hear back.""",2020-08-10 16:18:09

What she saying is that covid-19 is the respiratory illness that Bill Gates has been working on since prior to 2005 which he explains very well in video would have to be a widespread respiratory illness to work on the MAT2 genome properly as a matter of fact almost everything he says in the video is directly correlated .

Whether people choose to believe or not is on them but the facts are there and unless you've been living under a rock for the last 20 years that is what Bill Gates does now is funds and studies things like vaccines 4 illnesses..

Counsel drove him home with strict instructions to have two friends come and help him retrieve his car later.

Division, loss of family after pandemic. Some people have No one, loss entire family leaving just themselves without any support. Low affordable housing up to 2020 that was $500-800 monthly, has now increased to 1200 for a shithole. Landlords not repairing & in some cases people working two-three jobs paying rent come home to find bank repo letter on door after landlord/manager/owner bailed with money. Car repos have reached all time highs breaking records of 1970's during Carter & gas crunch & then double whammy during Reagan years.
After US citizens pay bills,taxes,medical some have ZERO finances left for food. Kids are hungry, theirs no entertainment thus leaving room to think about suicide to bail this shithole. I know each of you can add more to this list of grievances, please do. Getting people to vent, talking about how the American dream disintegrated, releasing the stress may save someone's life. I also loss everyone but my 17yr old son, & im fighting to survive financially, but still gracious as im 1yr into remission from pancreatic cancer tumor from Zantac medicine recall. Oncologist removed half my pancreas, doing a procedure called Whipple surgery, they couldn't get to billinary tree duct tubes blocked by tumor on pancreas. It was horrific. I don't think i could survive it again. 4½ MONTHS in hospital, 3m critical care unit. 316 staples across abdomen cut, across ribs to ribs. 
After all this & losing so much especially family, & im still breathing. I Love my Son, im not ready to leave him dammit. Grim Reaper needs to wait awhile, & if God is out there, hear me=there's Evil that deserves to go long before me. 
 
He has such a big heart. I hope he finds someone that truly cares & loves him. His good looks causes distraction from having so many GF's lol, laughing but serious. At 17 its critical to decide the path one should be taking to protect ones future survival in this world.

Usually I tell the cashier about any large items that I’m not placing up on the counter. Or at other times, they can just see my trolley and charge me accordingly. 

Anyway I went home and while going through the invoice, I realised the bag of onions wasn’t paid for. My whole family told me not to bother with it and just keep it. But being the goody two shoes that I am, I decided to go back to the shop and pay for it. That took me almost a week because the shop was a little out of my usual routes.

When a local University wanted to start a games design program in their CS college, they went to a bunch of the local talent in the industry to ask who could teach some course work in video game AI and got pointed in the direction of my friend multiple times. They came to him and after discussions brought him on to teach some courses. It wasn't until his second semester that anyone came asking about his credentials. When he revealed that he hadn't gone to college that apparently created some risk to their accreditation and they had to let him go.

The thing of it is, he was doing his thing before the field existed. He didn't have a degree because the field was literally him and people like him figuring things out as they went. He was good enough at it that many multiple people in the industry told the University that he was their guy if they needed someone to teach AI, and when all was said and done, he wasn't qualified enough on paper to teach the first official classes in a field he pioneered.

To be clear, I had no violent intentions. I wanted to tell the driver that a- she was incorrect and b- that she shouldn’t just yell out whatever because ... she also didn’t understand the situation. 
I’m not out flipping fingers ... I’ve used my horn once in 11 years.

iiuaqy,"Committing crimes isn’t a death sentence though dipshit. How often do you think people are getting arrested for murder in the process of committing it? Almost never, so there should be no correlation between murder rates and getting killed by the police. It’s painfully obvious to everybody but racists that our police are far to prone to shooting and violence.

Other countries don’t have the issue because their cops don’t pull guns out for everything, and nobody else is carrying guns.

The America’s have a higher murder rate than Africa, I wonder why you don’t talk about Latin and South America but focus on Africa? Hmmm 🤔",2020-08-30 02:03:45

hjvvj7,"Great question! It’s one that’s debated in the anticoag world. The general consensus is: no, there’s no need. For the majority of the population, a long flight constitutes one of the three triad arms: stasis. It’s also a very weak arm, as you are generally not “immobile” on a plane. You can move your feet, your arms, your legs. True stasis is immobile, like a hospital bed or a wheelchair. 

Aspirin is over the counter, but does not come without risks. It’s pretty insulting to the stomach lining (ulcers) and prolonged use of any NSAID increases your cardiovascular risks (heart attacks, strokes). It’s just not recommended to do KNOWN damage to your body, to help prevent the infinitely small CHANCE of a blood clot from a flight. 

Stretch, move your feet in circles, flex those calves/thighs, go take a walk to the bathroom! Those are all recommended much more than an aspirin 🙃",2020-07-02 16:19:18

sf4uc0,"Psychology trick.

When leading with very painful, immoral, or unconventional information; start off by giving the listener more than normal to compensate and adjust their mindset on the topic.

Case and point, “You can hire your brother BUT ONLY AT ONE DOLLAR BECAUSE OF COURSE WERE NOT PLAYING FAVORITES THAT WOULD BE BAD” 

They know it’s not okay, it’s a broken move in an even more broken system. But hey, other than complaining none of you can do anything about anything anyway 🤷🏻‍♂️

You can get a little deeper when you realize groups in power purposefully do these little “obvious bads” to shift your awareness and make you think you knowing and being able to complain and form an opinion actually makes a difference— when in reality you as a collective absolutely could just say “wow that’s fucked, but there’s more of us though so let’s stage a coup and make good changes ourselves”

They got married the week after her 18th birthday when he was 25. He’s no longer a youth pastor but he’s run for the local far right party a couple times and luckily failed. He used to be a cool guy too, my friend and I used to hang out with him all the time outside of youth, but as soon as we found out about the relationship between him and this girl who was much younger than us we cut him off.

Never mind, comment something not humping the leg of it's all mighty and boom.



If your curious like I was about how it looks getting told you are banned

You have been permanently banned from participating in r/Sino. You can still view and subscribe to r/Sino, but you won't be able to post or comment.

Note from the moderators:

State Department Lawyers Concluded Insufficient Evidence to Prove Genocide in China - ForeignPolicy

This is reality. Pointing it out doesn't mean we care what you think about it.

There's no white privilege here. You are not entitled to anybody's attention. Brigade and troll spam is about as effective against Sino as it is against China. Years of attempts, zero results. We have the best auto garbage disposal system on reddit. Imagine really believing BS but all you can do is spam trash on reddit...and fail at it 🤡 Try r/westerner

Don't bother with fake tough threats. McArthur also did it, just before longest retreat in history for US. https://streamable.com/s/nfdt5r Nobody in that US led force could approach within 100 miles of the Yalu River border area since. Talk after that changes.

If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/Sino by replying to this message.

Here’s what Jesus has to say about people like this guy..

Be on your guard against false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravaging wolves.
You’ll recognize them by their fruit. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit.
A good tree can’t produce bad fruit; neither can a bad tree produce good fruit.
Every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
So you’ll recognize them by their fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, drive out demons in your name, and do many miracles in your name? ’
Then I will announce to them, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you lawbreakers!  ",2018-01-11 04:57:31

She's naturally curvy and struggled to find loose enough clothing. She felt so ashamed she went home and cried.

When she was 16, her and her 19 year old boyfriend got caught having sex. She was punished and shamed and he was not even remotely disciplined because in my youth pastors words, ""the girls can control and help themselves, men can't.""

7pccil,"My comment is long, I’m sorry. 😔 Here’s a TLDR for that reason.

TL;DR - (I totally understand! It’s long. 😩) - Christianity has nothing to do with appeasing a God because you’re scared He will kick your ass. It’s about a meaningful friendship with someone who also loves you back. 

K, now for my actual comment: 
No. That’s not what God does, according to Christianity. He doesn’t force you to be a Christian, God won’t smite you down in one fell swoop if you make a mistake or choose not to be a Christian, and He won’t “hurt you” if you screw up or don’t follow Him. 

The only “punishment” for not being a Christian, according to Christianity, is going to hell. God does not cause anyone to get hurt, force pain upon people for not following the “rules”, so on and so forth. The same goes for when people say, “If God exists, how come bad things still happen, huh? How come God allows innocent people to be hurt and suffer?” Again, according to Christianity, the Original Sin is why bad things happen. God doesn’t *cause* anyone to be hurt. Bad things happen because, well, bad things just happen, end of. Also, God gave us 100% free will and that unfortunately means that people, Christian or otherwise, will use that free will to hurt others. 

You aren’t religious and that’s 100% okay. But, Christianity is most certainly not about “appeasing” someone more powerful than you because you’re afraid they’ll hurt you. Not at all. The best way I can describe Christianity is basically looking up to someone who you believe loves you, comforts you, is your solace when you’re hurting and you’re joy when you’re not, and being thankful for the fact that you feel you have a purpose *because* of God or because you *found* purpose through your relationship with God. I would describe Christianity as a very “casual” religion; you don’t go to mass, you don’t have to walk on a tightrope balancing being a human and train to rack up as many good deeds as possible to get into heaven. While there obviously is a calling to do good with things like the Ten Commandments and also just because, when you’re a Christian, you try to live by the golden rule and also treat people how God would. But, it’s more about a relationship with God - like a really meaningful friendship. 

As for the “father” thing, the Christian God is a loving God, I guess much like a good father *would* be. In Christianity, we are called “God’s children” so I don’t really think it’s weird to refer to him as “God the father” or “Heavenly Father”. Sure, it’s weird to *you* but you are not religious and I completely understand it seeming strange to someone who isn’t Christian and that’s okay. ☺️ There are aspects of other relationships that are strange to me, as well! I get it completely. ☺️",2018-01-10 09:04:52

yzvl91,"I disagree.

People saying that cops are good people is propoganda making people believe the cops won't do wrong and is a big part of the reason abuses by the police aren't believed.

Saying that if we come at cops for beating their wives with an almost 50% SELF reporting rate, they won't stop is just saying ""let them do it, and maybe eventually we will stop it at a systemic level"", and knowing that the legislative system will in no way make those reforms; if you recall, we tried that, and we're shut down. I'd honestly rather just vilify the cops so much that people don't become cops and abuse their power than wait around with my thumb up my ass for the law makers to decide to be honest and do something.

""Well then vote"" boy, I did vote, and it's not a solution when neither candidate is going to make a real change. What makes candidates make change? People on the ground making an outrage. You're saying sit tight in your house and wait for SOMEONE ELSE to make up a law and let them just repeal roe in the meantime, let them just repeal marriage equality in the meantime, don't pitch a fit, don't cause an alarm, because you're being a clown, and don't you look silly fighting for your rights? Don't you feel silly defending battered women and falsely incarcerated people? Don't you feel silly feeling bad for people who are raped in the prison system for nonviolent offenses? Don't you feel silly saying that rape isnt a justified punishment for shoplifting and that beating your wife isn't okay?

🤡 beating your wife is wrong and police should be held accountable🤡 targeting minorities is wrong and police should be held accountable🤡 

Id rather be a clown shouting ACAB than a bootlicker defending racist wife beaters.

wwbdv1,"My experience has been mostly great. In fact, I found it impossible to get anywhere with private insurance. When I became employed by the kind of companies that offered insurance, I thought I should just switch and pay out of pocket or whatever. 

But, I got nowhere. It was like referrals were a nebulous concept and even though I already had established medication, no one would continue it. It wasn’t even anything off the wall or high on the schedule. 

It was really weird. 

Meanwhile, my spouse goes in for Xanax for fear of flying and he gets it in hand the same day. It was the same GP. 

I went back to the VA. But, we moved very rural since I stopped using them and now I get everything through telehealth and it’s much better. I can be seen by all private doctors and facilities, but the VA pays. They even got me allergy panels and paid the emergency room visit when I first learned I was allergic to bee stings. 

There was one time I showed up at the ER in Denver and they went between accusing me of being some kind of drug seeking addict to being “too young and healthy looking” to be there. I was there for something skin related and not at all drug related and it was where call a nurse told me to go - this was essentially their sick call, there wasn’t any urgent care or anything. No idea what crawled up their asses that day. They acted like they were super busy, but this was a couple years before the pandemic and I sat there for 3 hours while no one else came in. It was the weirdest experience I ever had there. The doctor wanted to try to throw my words back at me to catch me in a lie and everything, and I swear she had seen me before and never acted like that. I was really just there to get a referral was how the call a nurse had put it but this doctor was acting like i just didn’t deserve any care at all. 

I got that handled via social media. That’s really all it seems to take these days. If you start publicly shaming a VA facility you will absolutely get the result you want. All I wanted was a damned dermatology appointment. I got one. Quick too. 😂",2022-08-24 20:57:23

ddbg3f,"they do have a point (not saying you shouldn't get upset either). you are thinking black and white, but remember that there's a loooooot of gray area.

you are thinking of dubious behavior. of course a boys and girls should not be touched on the chest/breast area with sexual intent.
that being said, we (boys) are raised, educated, and played with very differently than girls, specially on the boundaries of chest touching. 

think of a 13yo boy and a 13yo girl in summer camp, playfully wrestling in a lake, we guys get thrown around left and right and we are grabbed from around our chest, picked up from our crotch.
in the dining halls sometimes a gang of guys takes your shirt off against your will in front of a group of girls to embarras you. or simply someone will twist your nipple out of nowhere. for christ sake, we hit each other in the balls just for fun 🙄

girls on the other hand...well, they are told breasts should not be exposed, played with, maybe even be embarrassed of them. not to mention that girls have probably witnessed how breasts are sexualized on media all around them.

so if an adult male or female, touches a boy or a girl on the chest area, their reactions will vary most of the time. and all of it comes down to culture.

if male and female breasts become equals within the law, be it male chests becoming equal to female's, and having to cover them all the time and think of them as lewd. Or be it female breasts become equal to male's , and they can be exposed all the time, sexualization removed from them. in either case many other thinks get affected collaterlally. (sexual harrasmant laws, molestation laws, public indesent exposure laws, movie (any media) ratings,  internet, dress code in specific settings, cosmetic surgery (for cancer victims) and all of this at a state only level only so visitors (wether they be there for business or pleasure)  will have to abide to this state laws that will, in some cases, seam ludicrous.

Two of the Marines **somersaulted toward the center of the traffic circle**, thus using a form of movement the robot hadn’t been trained to identify. **Another pair shuffled toward the robot under a cardboard box**. One Marine even stripped a nearby fir tree and was able to reach the robot **by walking “like a fir tree” (the meaning of which Twitter users are still working to figure out)**.

I'm pretty much as high as I can go in my org without a degree, despite having a lot of experience and a degree in another field.

I finally told my boss a while ago that I literally couldn't afford to work for her anymore @ my wage and after a few promises of a promotion it wasn't happening. She was so offended that she yelled at me and then wouldn't even speak to me for weeks, because I was more focused on money than my job. Easy for her to say, as she was making literally twice what I make. Luckily I got another offer like a week later. It's just like, they're so out of touch with what everything costs. She owns property and I was spending over half my income on rent, not to mention student loans...

They want me to have an accounting designation. A lot of the older people have designations and look down on you if you don't. What they don't want to recognize is the fact that the designation *used* to just be some courses you took part time. Now you have to have a five year undergrad in business or pre req courses to even get in to the program, the degree obviously being astronomically expensive, and once you are finally accepted in to the program there are even more courses than there used to be, AND the dues and fees are waaaaay more expensive than they ever were before, and the program takes twice as long.

If I could have graduated highschool, worked for free for a year or two while living at home, and then landed a sick ""high level"" job after? You betcha, I'd have done that. But you want me to grind my balls so that I can get a job that *still* doesn't pay the bills?

f8fj8w,"You know in the speech everyone claims Trump said neo-nazis and white supremacists are ""very fine people?"" Well, in the sentence directly after he says ""And I'm not talking about the neo-nazis and white supremacists. They should be condemned totally."" It's obvious to anyone actually listening to Trump's words, and not talking heads on CNN, that he's talking about regular folks who are right of center.

BTW that's the FIRST press conference he gave after the Charlottesville protests. There's a separate speech he gave about three days later where he denounces white nationalists again.

I voted for Clinton in 2016 and I'm still a registered Dem. As an American living abroad, I'm shocked at the lies of leftist media that perpetuate Trump as some sort of white nationalist. 

So, yes. I do believe that a white nationalist would vote for a white Democrat before they vote for a Republican POC or Jew because, you know, they're white nationalist. (I can't believe I had to spell that out 🤦‍♂️)

zdutve,"In Singapore, even though cars might have the right of way, the car is still liable for the safety of anything on the road

So if you're on a road and there's a green light and you have right of way, but someone dashes and gets hit by your car, you will be charged with *Negligence with motor vehicle*

But of course the court can let you off if they clearly can tell the driver couldn't do anything to avoid the collision, and didn't flee. Example includes someone appearing from blind spot like between parked parallel cars, or insurance scammers

#--------

The idea is that the driver, who has in their hands a motor vehicle, is more dangerous compared to a pedestrian, and hence should always exercise caution. While the pedestrian might be at fault and can be punished, prevention is better than punishment and drivers cannot be careless on the assumption that they'll never be in trouble or fault. Also old people are old, and kids are dumb


This means that if you were speeding, or not looking ahead / at the road, were distracted on the phone, or drunk, then no matter how much *right of way* you had, you were not responsible enough to be operating such a dangerous luxury. Anyone in any of these states might not be able to prevent an accident that could have just been a near miss and a simple **knnbccb 🖕 **  from the driver to the reckless pedestrian. And maybe you can upload your dashcam to Facebook and get some ego boost for being such a responsible person who averted a mishap despite not being your fault

Ye.

#----------

Also fun fact, some conscriptees go to logistics support, where they become drivers (of big 1-tonners or transport vehicles). These are 19yos fresh out of high school with no driving experience, because the minimum driving age is 18 and it takes months to pass all the exams and practical test. And they are made to speedrun driving

Any scratch or incident when driving on public roads will result in time in Detention Barracks (prison but worse - like *stand in yellow box* and *run 1.5mi with weights on legs* bad)

I couldn’t agree more.  I’ve always felt this way.  I remember the first time I ordered them. I thought some one in the back was hired to strip the meat off of the bone like I do for my cats.  No.  It was nuggets.  I’m sick of buzz words that sell shitty products.  As ridiculous as this platform sounds, it has roots.  My kids know where their food comes from. Meat comes from bones and those bones grow from a creature.  As an omnivore by design, why sugar coat things.  Our kids need the truth and they make decisions based on what we teach them.  No one(in normal society) can afford to eat free range and all organic. Try shopping at Whole Foods 🙄and it’s a dilemma. But that up to them.  Stop lying to your kids because of your options. On a farm or  even 4h.  Never name your animals if you plan on eating them.
    Edit. : let me reiterate.  No one has the right to abuse animals. Even if it’s for food and there are a lot of humans now.  Respect your food but don’t lie about it.  I have a rescue ball python.

You're right, but i think you can still display narcissistic traits and not be a narcissist. It sounds like he could have npd along with other issues though or just display narcissistic traits with some other mental disorders. I think npd is a spectrum and not every narcissist is as smart as your parents were. 

He does kind of sound a bit like a schitzo type and I think it's confirmed he has bi polar but i dont think people with bi polar and schizophrenic type disorders are often like this where they think they are the victim all the time.

I would say it most likely is a combo of the 3 disorders since I think he was diagnosed bi polar, schizophrenics can sometimes think they are Jesus, and he has a very grandios version of himself which often comes with fame and fortune like a narcissist, but I'm no expert

I think narcissists do think they are always the victim

So yes im thankful he is giving these interviews to assure us that it is not just a perception issue but loud and proud antisemitism.

Mental health problems too, for sure - but there is no condion with antisemitism as a symptom.

8ksvlt,"Not to be ""that guy"" but if she were speaking English like all Americans should, this wouldn't be an issue

Edit - enough with the downvotes guys. America is an English speaking country. Not speaking it is just going to lead to problems. There's nothing racist about expecting Americans to speak the native language 

Edit 2 - I understand there's no ""official"" language but it's understood that everyone speaks English. It's a public hazard to not be able to read and write English. You can't cater to every minority group and have everything written in 1000 languages. Imagine some not English speaking immigrant has a highly contagious disease and can't articulate her symptoms to the doctor. Would you want your kids exposed because some immigrant is too lazy to learn the country's language?

Edit 3 - CUT IT OUT with the downvotes. It's a violation of Reddiquette to downdoot an opinion 

Edit 4 - the Native American thing is such a terrible argument. We conquered them and founded America. You don't expect the English to speak Latin because the Romans once occupied their land do you? ✌🏽✌🏽😄

Edit 5 - Our schools don't have time to teach actually useful things because of teacher unions forcing shorter school days/years. I'd rather my kid take more time learning important things than learning Spanish or German or aborigine or whatever you think they should learn

So only people who had that choice in providers could find themselves in this situation. Ergo, there were other options.

Don't forget that the comment I was replying to was looking at it like a monopolistic utility (as it is in a vast majority of the US). So, my pointing out that they had options seems pretty valid.

    What’s this island about?
This is the island Hawaii 2, owned by Hawaii 2, LLC, an affiliate of Cards Against Humanity. We bought the island and then gave it away as a gift for our 2014 Holiday Bullshit campaign. We sent 250,000 Holiday Bullshit subscribers a license, a map, and a small Hawaii 2 flag. Now Hawaii 2 is open for the public to visit and enjoy.

But why?
If someone else bought the island, they’d build a summer home or a condo or a TGI Friday’s™. This way, the land will be kept as a pristine piece of wilderness. You can read more about how we bought the island here.

Can I visit?
You’re free to visit the island as long as you don’t build, bury, or damage anything and otherwise observe the rules above. You can picnic, hike, and take photos, just don’t leave trash of any kind.

I'm a license holder. Can I plant my flag on the island?
No, you can’t plant your flag (or anything else). Just plant it in the ground and take a photo of it or something, but don’t leave the flag, because we’ll just throw it away.

I was part of the 2014 Holiday Bullshit. Do I really own a piece of the island?
No, Hawaii 2, LLC owns the island, but you have rights to use it as a license holder.",2016-11-27 03:30:27

## Are biodegradable diapers better for today’s environment?

 Not really. Current landfill sites are operated as sealed environments with restricted air and water flow. Operating a landfill in this way allows the capture of methane gas that can be converted to energy. Kimberly-Clark (makers of Huggies® diapers) is currently using methane from a landfill at our Beech Island Manufacturing Facility. This sealed landfill environment is how consumer waste such as disposable diapers is currently disposed of in the United States (1). Huggies Brand will continue to design products that are compatible with customary disposal methods; as disposal technologies change, Huggies diapers will change.

v07nh0,"Not very low with families that actually fed them nutritionaly sound meals and didn't follow fad diets that consisted of mostly sugar. Yep, sugar used to be considered a medicine in very recent years, until that was later retracted due to the sudden spike in diabetes and dementia and Alzheimer's. 

Oh and let's not forget when women used to work in factories and lick radioactive substances to make them adhere to watches. Those substances allowed watch dials and faces to glow in the dark. Oh and the people who wore these items also received low dose radiation poisoning too. 
But, the factory owners were allowed to continue production despite all the females eventually suing after their teeth started falling out, they were losing hair and contracting cancer. 😐
Oh and let's not forget the fact that radiation poisoning also makes you infertile. But, if you somehow give birth with radiation in your system, the baby is born with birth defects or just still born.

Yep, the mortality rate was low... But we're currently here all fucked up because modern medicine and science werent good enough back then. 

Oh wait... I almost forgot about the time big pharma was handing out cocaine as a form of medicine and putting ""hot blooded"" women in psych wards until they calmed down or until the husband approved her for leave.

ujyjbi,"Haven't played but had a friend absurdly into it a long time ago, and I think the fan base is like one of the cult classic die hardship (not saying this in a negative way either). So it has made me think I probably need to check it out!

For the excel, I will tell you right now you don't need excel to play the game, and I mean ""need"" as in like when someone says ""oh you don't need a strategy guide for this game its totally doable and easy"" and then you play the game like and you're like ""ok wtf how would ANYONE figure this shit out without a guide"" lol. 

When people often use or refer to spreadhseets for gaming, it is 99% of the time due to their play style following a ""min-max"" methodology. Min maxing allows you to calculate, predict and strategies your gear, dps, runtime, downtime, etc etc down to exact numbers and variables in some cases. 

Why's it matter to some? Welp for starters, it is almost always 2 primary factors that drive this behavior: Time, and/or Competive Interest based. A great example: if there is an aspect of the game that has severe RNG (like drop rates on an end boss item) and repeating that process can't be done quickly or easily (such as defeating said end game boss), then this is where the spreadsheets/minmax/precise calculation provide HUGE value to players. Getting down to the nitty gritty math and crunching numbers with various skill builds, team compositions and items s can literally save people sometimes hundreds of hours of grind time. Time is something you just can't get back, so RNG can be a VERY difficult part of of a gaming experience if you're getting that ""shit luck streak"".

Anywho, competitive is entirely different, and often relates to PVP, and the driver is VERY simple--people want to calculate the MAX amount of value (ie: DEEEPS lul) to wreck someone's shit up and be on top. No explanations needed there rofl 😆",2022-05-07 18:07:22

Im not trying to show off my knowledge of definitions, if I came across that way I am sorry.

You are preaching to the converted,  I wear a mask. 

(I am sorry to hear that about you mother, she sounds like a strong person and someone to admire.)

I believe there are health issues that prevent people from wearing a mask: Autism, learning disabilities and people who lip read are an example.
 (Yet i suppose they could wear a see-through visor). 

As the person is requesting removal of citizenship and exile of all anti maskers, this is as the definitions described, fascism and prejudice.

m8762d,"Hi thank you for your reply. 

Noted 😊

But I honestly I respect your polite and considerate response.

May I ask your opinion? If you don't wish to answer no problem.  

Lets say a government decided it was now legal to remove citizenship of individuals who do not wear a mask. The government will force people to move to a different country if a person refused to wear a mask. 
How would you define these actions of a government? Not the person,  specifically the state and authority that is endorsing this rule.

It's definitely not pointless for the specific reasons it exists (expression, covering of private parts, warmth)

I have an unpopular opinion, so I expect people to disagree. But I hope people will engage and communicate in an appropriate manner, as there is always opportunity to learn from one another. 

I completely agree with you.

When I saw that comment, I believed that was the early stage of potential fascism or a downward spiral into very controversial and dangerous territory. 
Hence my response, knee jerk reaction,  when selecting specific words regarding the definitions of prejudice and fascism.  

And I do see where I was wrong. 

But in my view, as long as I am trying to do the right thing, I.e. wearing a mask and willing to take a vaccine to help people,  I am honestly not bothered by someone's decision to do neither,  as its their choice. 

Thank you and take care 😊",2021-03-19 18:33:38

Thus, when it comes to ordering from that specific company, no one should be surprised that Amazon doesn't protect their employees even in the event of catastrophic storms that often prove fatal for many, many people.

Then maybe there should be, I don't know, some legislation to protect workers and worker's rights? Why should the responsibility of protecting workers from extreme weather rely on the customer to not order during the weather instead of the company to not make them work during that weather?

Apparently the police union is incredibly stupid. That doesn't even make sense. They had an actual lawyer do this? I'm not a lawyer and I can think of ~~three~~ four reasons this is not remotely valid. 

1. ""LAPD"" has been in general circulation since before the foundation existed. 

2. It is clearly under the free speech protection since it's not attempting to present itself as the LAPD, but rather mocking the LAPD.

3. The LAPD logo, every place I can find it, is not labeled as Copyright with the © symbol or copyright info - **including on the LAPD Foundation's own website**.

4. You cannot selectively apply copyright material. Ergo *every other instance* where they did *not* attempt to force someone to stop using the LAPD letters is proof that they have not made any attempt to protect their copyright, making this selective and malicious. I've heard the term before but basically if I copyright ""Qubeye Industries"" and then someone else uses that without my consent **AND** I don't pursue legal action **AND** I am aware of it, I lose my copyright.

I think we can all agree this is clearly *traditional* trademark infringement where it is too similar to the original, but the question is does the **parody defense** protect it?? 

Which I'd say it does **not**. In order to be a successful defense, it needs all to:

* **Clearly distinguish itself from the original mark** - ❌ - far too similar
* **Not create confusion about the source or sponsorship** ❌ - it suggests the LA Lakers are associated with the parody
* **Be a commentary or criticism of the original mark or its owner** ❌ - definitely not related to the LA Lakers or the logo owner (Jeanie Buss)

Further, there are other protections such as Trademark **Dilution**, where this altered logo tarnishes the brand's image and is afoul of that too.

All of this should seem perfectly reasonable too. For example, nobody wants to have a business logo that somebody adds Nazi stuff to it and popularizes it, when the business has nothing to do with the parody, political message, or Nazis.",2024-05-22 17:54:43

Breakfast is basic, but healthy (oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, coffee, etc). We don't really eat junk food or avocado toast too much, and that's an obvious extra expense for everyone else. 😐

We don't eat out very much and doing that would obviously blow the budget to smithereens.

That being said, this guy clearly never shops for groceries, which also includes non-food items. Apparently, the average Canadian family of four spends $1000 / month on food.

12mb8yj,"Sure, I don't agree with pedophilia and immorality, but-- what's wrong with sensorial pleasures? 

It's now spiritually bad to enjoy the pleasures of life🌄; the smell of roses, the cuteness of children's smiles, enjoying good music, the taste of delicious food, creating art, and the satisfaction of making love to another adult~ are guilty activities? 

Sensorial pleasures are what makes life enjoyable. What's wrong with enjoying the sounds of friends' laughter— or disco lights?? Following our dreams because it makes us feel happy is spiritually weak? 

No offense to anyone, but to me it looks like the Dalai Lama must be in a dark place right now, if he thinks sensorial pleasures are not good for spirit.

12mb8yj,"There's also one post on Reddit from someone saying this isn't normal in Tibet:    

From VulcanVisions:    

>I am Tibetan. I have shared this before in several places, but thought I would share again here of this is the official channel. I would like to give some cultural insights, as well as my own view.

>The only cultural element we have involving tongues comes from a legend about an evil king, Lang Darma, who was so corrupted by Mara that his tongue turned black and his words spread his corruption. They poisoned the hearts and minds of all who heard them. It is believed that his reincarnations also have the black tongue, and because of this, we stick our tongues out in greeting as a gesture of trust, to say ""hey look! I am not corrupted! You can trust me!""

>But this does not lead to any form of tongue contact anywhere in my culture. The only instance I have seen of a teacher touching tongues was during a Losar ritual where certain attending members have the teacher place a liquid drop on their tongues, but even this is unusual, as the drop is usually placed by yourself.

>I have heard several people saying that the Dalai Lama meant the tongue sucking comment as a joke, to get a sudden shocked reaction. I have two problems with this; first that ""tongue sucking"" is the first place his mind went, there were surely many other ways to get a laugh and be silly. And second that the child had already tried to lean away from the Dalai Lama, but the Dalai Lama pulled him in for a hug. There is a lot of violation of bodily integrity going on here, and suggesting something like tongue sucking carries sexual connotations anyway, but is especially disturbing to me considering the person involved here is a child. It just isn't appropriate, and neither is the kiss on the lips - asking a child to kiss anyone, especially on the lips, is in very unsettling territory, and is not a normal physical contact event at all in any sense. It just shouldn't happen.

>I have heard numerous people in the Tibetan Community defending the actions of the Dalai Lama - many perceive him as infallible, and here another cultural explanation may be helpful - to my people, the Dalai Lama is not merely a wise or important man, but is believed to be the manifested avatar of the Bodhisattva of Compassion, Avalokiteshvara. He is therefore seen as a magical god king on earth, in a very literal and not a symbolic sense. As such, there is a great potential of abuse of power from him and his disciples, as anything he does is generally interpreted as profound wisdom, even if it quite clearly isn't. He is still a man, and like all people should be held accountable for any goings on.

>There is certainly institutional abuse in the Buddhism of my homeland. How widespread I cannot say, but I have witnessed it first hand. This recent event with the Dalai Lama reminded me of something I saw on two separate ocassions when I was very young at Gelug monasteries - young girls, barely in puberty, were brought shirtless before a panel of usually three ""great teachers"", and the teachers would ""bless"" their breasts, supposedly to ensure fertility, easy labor, healthy children, and a happy motherhood for these girls. I could not put this into words at the time, but I am quite sure I was witnessing abuse - there is nothing cultural about doing this, and the teachers were very hands on with the girls.

>I would like to add that the Dalai Lama does not represent Tibetan Buddhism. He is a teacher, but he is not the dharma. The teachings are the teachings, and however much one decides to follow the dharma is down to each being. If any of you are struggling with your faith after this came to light, I would offer that the behaviour of anyone, great teacher or otherwise, does not reflect the quality of the teachings themselves.

>I am sorry to any who were affected or shaken by this event. May you find peace from this 🙏",2023-04-15 16:33:00

No organization, nation, religion or culture is perfect. Each takes its own time to come to a certain awareness and acceptance of certain realities.

No one was breaking America apart before 2015 when gay marriages were not acceptable. No one was banning America from the UN when Jim Crow was being practiced till the 60s against African HUMANS.

Whenever Western countries suddenly find a good path, they want to immediately subject the entire globe to it, forgetting that in the 15,000+ years of human existence and 150 years of rapid technological and medical advancement, gay folks couldn't be recognized as couples until 2015 --- in the almighty America.

75wajx,"It's still not a good analogy. The difference in size between a watermelon and a quarter is exponentially greater than a baby's head and a vagina.. In addition, babies' skull plates aren't completely fused (they're born with a hole called the fontanelle) so the skull is very flexible, the bones can move and overlap, making the circumference of the head smaller as it is squeezed by the birth canal. You squeeze a watermelon and it bursts (there are a million videos on YouTube demonstating this with rubber bands). The unfused plates are why babies are often born with pointy heads that return to a normal shape after a couple of days.

It's just a shitty analogy meant to scare kids or something. It actually irritates me that childbirth is presented to women all our lives as the worst thing that might ever happen to us, so we go into it already terrified, and it makes it worse than it is because the fear can prevent you from actually managing the pain. Childbirth is just a physical challenge. Running marathons can hurt too but no one tries to tell you how much the physical exertion and the pain will suck and it's awful and traumatic. Maybe if we spent more time teaching pain management techniques childbirth wouldn't suck as hard.

I’m a person on Reddit, so by rule I don’t like this person either. but there’s a million different types of ways to “work hard,” a million people who were born into privilege that did nothing with it, and a million people who did sex work on camera that aren’t billionaires. 

Who works harder, a WFH SaaS account executive making 300k a year to attend 7 zoom meetings and send 15 emails a week, or her? People like this get to be this ubiquitous and wealthy because they are ruthless and are never off the clock. It may not be work you or me think of as noble work, but the units of work being done are still significant. 

no, I’m not a fan of her or the industries that feed her wealth, I’m not defending her honor or anything, and I’m not claiming to be some kind of champion of sex work. 

I’m asking you to examine the nature of the vitriol you are spewing, and if it’s REALLY about her sex video, or if it’s just that you’re mad that she’s rich. Because if it’s the latter, then your comments about the video make you no better than a bully resorting to cheap debate tactics to discredit a statement she made. If it’s the former, then you’re prolly not as progressive about sex work as you think you are.

Is it that you want your sex workers to keep their ambitions low so they don’t make you feel bad about your own lot in life? Or are you not even thinking about that, because all you know for sure is the dopamine hit you’ll get when a flood of 3.2k updoots hits your reply to this post that says “Kim k bad, she sucked a wiener, eat the rich.”

Look, you can downvote all you want, it won't change the fact *legacy preference was literally invented to keep WASPs the majority of top universities*.

> Immigrants—especially the children of Jewish immigrant families—and Catholics and **people from modest socioeconomic backgrounds frequently performed well on the new admissions tests and started to garner large numbers of undergraduate seats at top universities, while the number of admissions for wealthy white Anglo-American stock dropped significantly**. **In response, several Ivy League institutions began an official practice of legacy admissions**, designed to reserve large numbers of seats at the top schools for the sons of wealthy Protestant American stock. These legacy admissions included decreasing the importance of entrance exams and adding such elements as assessing the ""personal characteristics"" of the young men seeking admittance, considering their ""home influence,"" interviewing some of the applicants, and asking for letters of recommendation attesting to their character. **Such elements in the application process curtailed the admittance of immigrants, Jews, Catholics, and working-class men and restored the overwhelming presence of the white, wealthy Anglo-Protestant men.**

10 times, read it slow each time.

At the time that most of these legacies were started open discrimination against women was not only ""PC"" was enshrined in the culture of the time.

If you can understand how it's discriminatory against other races, please, use a few of your brain cells and figure out how the same applies to women.

>How much do you want to bet in a few decades, when the legacy being formed now of women and ethnic minorities starts to grow, suddenly all these schools will see the light and kill legacy preference 🤔


... ok stay with me now...

because now women are treated on more equal footing! Same with the other races! That's how that sentence works!

Clap for yourself if you made it this far and didn't die from heat stroke working out the steam engine that is your pea sized brain :)


Edit: Don't worry folks, I messaged the simpleton to let them know that around the time of Jim Crow women weren't getting treated so well either. How fucking stupid do you need to be to have that spelled out for you.

Also just for the record, I'm a senior software engineer at 24, this fucking loser is projecting some sort of need for improvement they have on myself, I'm great, I just don't like the idea my sister that earned her way into medical school will forever have useless fucks saying it's just affirmative action, or the idea she had to compete with kids who got in because great granddad was a wealthy white protestant fuck and gets preferential treatment 🤷🏾‍♂️

When I went to school, they occasionally paddled kids for certain misbehaviors. So kids behaved. They listened to the teachers who were paid less than they are today. We had guidance counselors, but nobody had to use them. And nobody ever heard of a school shooting. 

You could hear a pin drop in the classroom. Kids for the most part loved their teachers, and mutual respect was generally the order of the day.

But no, no, youre doing it wrong. Lets change it all, and it will be much better.

And now you have the complete shit-show that it has become, with violence, no control over classrooms, utter disrespect and disobedience, faltering competency and quitting teachers who can't stand the very kids they ate supposed to teach any more.

Arafat didn’t even try to negotiate. Just flat out said no, or “we want all or nothing.” Also hard to compromise with Hamas, the terrorist organization. Also, I think a good indicator of compromise was when Israel forced its own citizens out of Gaza which didn’t stop any of the terrorism.

But to be fair my mother leased a Altima 2.5s back in 2003, at the end of the 3 year lease she bought it out and still has it today with 88k on it. The only things its needed since new are 3 batteries, brake pads/rotors a couple of times, front struts, a set of front calipers and an alternator. Could use new rear shocks as well but they are good enough. Oh and the drivers power seat height adjustment doesn't work because the nylon gear is stripped. No other repairs have been done.  I am trying to track down a misfire in cylinder 4 that randomly occurs when the car is cold. Plugs look good. So looking at other possibilities such as a possible coilpack issue or carbon deposits although cylinder 4 plug looked clean as a whistle.

Car wash maintained. Until about a two years it had never even been in an accident but a deer lightly kissed the passenger side. No major damage, just some mild dents that could be taken out by a skilled dent wizard. Only rust on the entire body is right rear quarter right where quarter meets wheel well and bumper cover edge, maybe a 4-5 inch by 2 inch area. And for some reason the clear is peeling on the left rear passenger door along the beltline from window molding down about 2 inches otherwise paint is perfect except for one small scrape on front bumper, very recent and moms fault.

This guy can't even keep what he himself says straight. 

He doesn't have any names. If they were members of his church, he would have all their addresses, not just one. That information is kept on file. Someone had said something about smudging and another person agreed and probably said they also have done it or had a conversation about burning sage. 

Also its a tactic to break trust and close ties between members and have them rely more on the leader for more information through fear. 

If they're witches why threaten them on stage. Just expose them. Oh, but that leads to an anticlimactic event that does him no benefit. 

Now anyone in his church that speaks against him, dude who has said he's never sinned, will have to be a witch.

sth4i9,"Ok, so Satan led a rebellion against God and needed to be punished. That sounds about right. But then Gid punishes Satan by... allowing him to reign over Hell? That's not a punishment, that's a promotion! Condemning Satan to eternal torture in Hell would be one thing. Giving him command of Hell and allowing him to have access to God's people on Earth in order to tempt them and lead them astray is not a great move. It's definitely not a punishment for Satan and it kind of feels like humanity was set up for failure if it's so easy for Satan and his agents to get to us.


IIRC, there's a prophecy in Revelation that describes Satan being thrown into the Lake of Fire for all eternity, but it only happens AFTER the second coming of Christ, and even then he's still allowed to operate and tempt humanity for a thousand years after that. Then and only then is he finally vanquished for good. But why does it have to be like that? If God is all-powerful, why didn't He just throw Satan into the Lake of Fire for all eternity in the first place? Why doesn't He do it now? If Satan truly is an evil force in this world, freeing humanity from his influence would surely be the right move, right?

I also don't understand why it's so surprising and disappointing when people give into temptation and sin. God is the one who allowed Satan to have agency to tempt humanity, he doesn't get to be all shocked Pikachu when humans fall to said temptation. It's not like He didn't know it was going to happen either, he is omniscient 🙃🙃🙃",2022-02-16 12:43:05

You can believe God is always present (omnipresent) and powerful enough to create the universe (omnipotent), and also believe God will allow sin to happen, and also believe God will allow man to have free will.

6me9rb,"I haven't heard this term used as a specific designation, at least at our hospital, but the semantics make sense. The hospital is usually notified ahead of time of an impending patient who is critical as passed along from the first responders and then disseminated to all necessary hospital departments via the ER dispatcher. A page will be sent out giving a time of arrival to the hospital (ER, OR, ICU's, radiology, Housing Supervisor, etc) . So we usually have a head's up that something big is coming. Not all of these cases require surgery. More often than not a patient will be sent to the scanner to see what is happening internally and then to the ICU to stabilize. 

I have been many surgery where the patient hits the doors of the ER bay and enters surgery within a handful of minutes. The surgeons are usually really good about telling the OR that they are crashing up (except neurosurgeons...there was one time they were already in the OR without even telling me they were coming...massive eye rolls after that case finished 🙄)

908fsr,"A work friend has had the misfortune of discovering her years of GI issues, which she'd assumed was just an intolerance or allergy to something unknown, turned out to be true Celiac disease. So finding out was amazing on the one hand I'm sure, since she found out what to avoid and why, but oh god I don't know what I'd do without wheat gluten...

While the idiocy of being gluten intolerant as a diet fad has lead to an increased public awareness of the issue, and also shifting demand in a way that is ever increasing the places she can find restaurant food, those with actual Celiac are still getting kinda fucked. I was aware of food service being suspicious of the intolerance claims having worked in restaurants myself. Though I took allergies quite seriously, opting to stick to protocol (probably the only times I really ever did) it was still pretty irritating when I'd have some idiot woman feign gluten sensitivity in some way, being a total selfish asshole with questions about everything... only to order something breaded or some sandwich, then be quite upset when it arrived heavily altered to remove the gluten. I can also recall so many claims made of gluten intolerance where five minutes after actually ordering appropriately for her ""condition"", I'd be getting bitched at because she didn't get bread... 🤦‍♂️

But despite those moronic examples, who'd argue that claim would better ensure that their dietary preferences were adhered to, my friend let me in on a horrific consequence. The prevalence of ""gluten free"" certification/labelling has certainly increased, obviously targeting idiots since I see steak and other things unrelated to wheat gluten with no possibility of cross contamination. But disgustingly the food industry got the regulation set at 200ppm for official ""gluten free"" certification... but she begins reacting at less than a quarter of that level (I think that's what she told me, but I know it is far below the certification). So it is wholly ineffective for many of those it is meant to help, and the consequence makes me feel lucky to have just lactose intolerance!",2018-07-20 02:11:38

8kf35a,"As a current student majoring in English education, this has to be one of the worst ways I’ve seen to teach literature. What helps kids connect more with Literature is encouraging them to find their own interpretation—their own meaning—in the text. How does this help them understand Hamlet better? 👨🔪👴🙏❓❌ 😇 How is that better than [that scene where Hamlet almost kills Claudius](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/hamlet.3.3.html) ? Why not, instead, ask them “what does this mean?” And let them come to a conclusion in the text rather than telling them to use the very limited pictorial vocabulary—if such a word may be used—and spoon feeding them that Hamlet has an Oedipus complex and Ophelia is a weak heroine. 

And I suppose, yes, the emoji version is technically an interpretation. But what use is an interpretation that doesn’t get to a better understanding of the text, rather begs explanation of summary. 

[EDIT] thank you to everyone who has commented. It’s made me think some, and I think I think I’ve changed my mind while also becoming more informed. And I will try to be more open minded in the future. This kind of interaction is why I like studying literature and discussing it. And I think it’s important that you should be able to change your mind with discussion. I was wrong, but, please know, that I came from a good-intentioned position. Thank you again.

8kf35a,"In work in special needs it’s common to use a symbol processor \- like a word processor, but you type in the text and get a symbol for every word. They can help students with poor literacy follow text, or alllw people who will never be able to read to follow a recipe or shopping list etc.

There’s lots of evidence that this sort of symbol support can aid comprehension, and that people can learn a symbol language and attach nuance and difference in meaning to different symbols.

Emoji are largely based on these symbol dictionaries. 

Text is just packaging for a word or concept, really. It isnt any more meaningful or communicatively useful to write ‘snake’ instead of using 🐍 \- it’s just convention! ",2018-05-19 09:29:39
8kf35a,"Having written my MA thesis on the adoption of Netspeak and emoji in literature, I'd argue the position emoji are ineffective in communicating information (the whole purpose of words) is disproven by many studies in which they been shown to communicate information *more* efficiently. 

The brain actually recognizes the face emoji similar to how it does the human face, so the brain perceives emotional content more quickly and accurately than it does from words. Think about the ""ironic"" 😉, and then think about how much language is required to communicate the same depth of emotional content. 

The view is also elitist. Language is a living, breathing thing. We started with pictures; there must have been a reason. Perhaps they communicated certain types of information more directly, universally, and efficiently. 

Indeed, the evidence shows they do: think about the symbol for poison - the skull and crossbones. One symbol vs. the 20 in those three words. Direct, universal, and efficient. Why wouldn't someone use such effective tools when teaching, especially if dealing with social obstacles? 

As someone who teaches, one of the most important things I've learned is to meet my student where they are, not where I imagine they should be. Whether older generations like them or not, emoji are part of language now. Trying to deny them out of some misguided attempt at linguistic purity ignores the very history of language.

Kids are confused by Shakespeare, so instead of teaching them to understand the material, lets summarize it with them using emoji.  Pull out your phone and boil down plays into smiley faces.  NO says other teachers - kids who can't keep up with english will never catch up if you waste time using emojis instead of simply doing a better job at teaching the actual material.

8kf35a,"I think what a lot of these ""use emoji translations to teach kids classic literature"" people are missing is that even people who use emojis... Don't use them like that. Certainly young adults and teenagers who were around my age don't. Emojis are mostly like punctuation that text only doesn't get across, because a huge majority of communication now is text based. Like, 😏 might be used to mean ""I made a sexually suggestive comment and you can take it as such"" or 💅 might be used to imply a flippant tone. We don't have official punctuation that implies these things mid-dialogue, and action asterisks to pretend that you're actually doing what the emoji implies (like \*files nails like a cartoonish prom queen\*) is generally seen as cringey.

Not that you CAN'T use emoji as its own language, I wrote a short story like that on a bet once, but we don't because that's not useful. That's what's fellowkids about it. It's like saying ""ell oh ell"" out loud, in person. It's unnecessary at best and at worst destroys the original meaning of the translated work.",2018-05-19 00:27:16

You think that the most powerful government in the world, that is renowned for invading other countries, will respect the freedom of its own people out of the kindness in its heart if it knows they are powerless and defenseless?

History is full of disarmed populations getting marched to their executions and digging their own graves, and you think we should just trust our government to not do that? I don't even trust YOU not to kill me, let alone the government.

If you want to be weak, powerless, defenseless, and at the mercy of every criminal and politician, go ahead. But I'd rather not. Let's just let each other choose for ourselves. You defend yourself with hopes and prayers, and I'll use guns. Fair enough?",2023-05-08 22:35:23

54tleo,"Sit down son, and let me tell you the story of the Great Meme War. 

Rumblings of a conflict breaking out had been echoing across the Internet for some time, with tensions between websites and anonymous users rising to dangerous heights; desperate to reap the rewards of imaginary Internet fame, the primary nation-states (Facebook 🇷🇺, iFunny 🇬🇧, 9Gag 🇫🇷, Reddit 🇩🇪, and 4Chan 🇦🇹) and began to stockpile memes by the millions. 

The spread of the Internet revolution years before enabled these nations to mass produce their memes like never before. Even still, no shots had been fired, only whispers of the inevitable. However, what pushed the gears of war into motion was the assassination of Archduke Franz Harambe at the hands of normie rebels on Twitter 🇷🇸, sparking the conflict and setting the Internet on a path which it could not turn back on. 

Battle lines were drawn between grandmothers browsing the Internet and determined neckbeards, social media fiends and twisted teens. In retaliation, 4Chan invaded Twitter, pouring hundreds of thousands of memes into it major cities. Seeing this, iFunny moved to support Twitter by declaring war on 4Chan. Reddit declared war on iFunny to support 4Chan, and Facebook and 9Gag joined iFunny's cause against them. 

4Chan mourned its lost leader, and sent waves upon waves of pamphlets detailing how to honor his memory across the Internet. Titled ""Dicks out for ma Boi Harambe"", these emboldened their allies and struck fear into their enemies. 

This war was like no other. No longer a chivalrous rivalry for border fan bases, this became a war for keeps, and this total war resulted in casualties on a scale never before seen. The nations found themselves fighting a war of brutal shitposting with antiquated ideals and ethics of the pre-mainstream Internet. 

Rules of engagement were thrown out the window. Armies which were trained to excellence with rage comics and advice animals were slaughtered between the trenches by an unending onslaught of Cavebobs, Arthur fists, and John Cenas. Facebook, having an older user base unwilling to adapt to this new dirty style of shitposting, was quickly crushed without mercy. 

Reddit began streaming across 9Gag's borders. Whenever 9Gag posted a revolutionary meme which could turn the tides of war on its front page, Reddit spies reposted it almost immediately, negating their effect. The war was fought almost to the capital of 9Gag itself before iFunny intervened and halted the wave. 

At this point in the war, the nation of iMessage Group Chats 🇺🇸 has remained neutral, but has been developing a new piece of weaponry which could change the tide once again. It's true identity remains unknown, but it's code name was discovered to be Pawn Shop, and its creator is me, the brilliant citizen inventor Rick Harrison. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss. Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gonna come through that door.",2016-09-28 03:45:25

3. No idea but most students have cellphones, more people today are getting their literature from Audible and Kindles than actual physical copies

I've routinely said here that I am for vetting but think the penalty is absurd.

I'm for vetting because I remember being 12 with my friends and finding things in our school library that we definitely weren't gonna show to our parents or the staff.

We found The Anarchist Cookbook.
We found a Medical Journal detailing extreme surgery, sexually transmitted diseases and other borderline things that at the time and our maturity level weren't necessarily appropriate, we went around showing people the images to shock them for a laugh.
We found a playboy in a stack of magazines on the shelves 
We found several erotic novels and used to read some of the lines outloud and laugh our asses off 

I think it's important to vet these libraries as they are mostly on a donation level and currently there not a whole lot of looking at what's actually in the school library going on.

We used to literally as kids in 6 - 8th grade go to the school library durring class to cut class and we would walk around purposefully trying to find the most racist, shocking, or sexual books in the place and we were successful 100% of the time.  Yes. I WAS that immature.",2023-01-23 21:24:12

Remember to start your week by charging you anus with the power of the sun. Your anus is considered the “Fourth Eye” and it’s directly connected to your “Third Eye” and pineal gland. Absorbing sunlight through your anus is a great way to recharge your whole system. For many people in the world their anus is the seat of their consciousness and their consciousness needs brightening, what better way to brighten your mood by getting light to the darkest area of your body; if more people received nourishing light particles through their anus I believe there would be far less assholes in the world. 📷

rjsikw,"Despite the sinister and creepy aspects to this 'national shoot up your school day' - you have to admit - it was actually a peaceful protest. 

The only way to stop children from bringing guns to school 🔫 is for all children to bring guns to school.  🔫 

In Australia they had 1 school shooting once upon a time that they took seriously the 1st time and immediately enacted successful gun control- which has worked for decades now.   

American politicians are basically too timid and weak to enact effective gun control measures.  It will take more than the epidemic of mass shootings of our children to create progress.  So what will it take in America?

? Armed Peaceful Protests Composed of Children ?

Black panthers open carried firearms in California when Ronald Reagan was governor of California- and you've never seen a Republican cry 😢 for state gun control so fast as Ronald Reagan in California - because Black people had guns.  Then,  when Reagan was president, Ronny was shot by a lunatic.  So he cried for the Brady Bill (named after another man who was with Reagan who was shot in the head).  And they did that fast.  

So you can see that White Fear equates peaceful protests by armed Black people to Assassination Attempts on the Republican Dear Leader.  🤔 Deranged.

There needs to be actual armed Peaceful Protests with children's militias for this issue to be taken seriously.

Yes, barring extreme medical conditions, everyone can survive on plants. Every primate on the planet is 95%+ plant based diet, and every area with high life expectancy (blue zone) is 95% vegan

vegans live longer and have lower incidence of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer 😮

This studies 90k adventists in the USA, the group is a “blue zone” meaning they have a long life expectancy compared to the rest of the USA.

There is a huge reason why golf is madly popular with professional athletes (especially after retiring) across almost all sports (Football ⚽️ , Football 🏈 , hockey, basketball, baseball, Olympians of many disciplines, etc.) and that is because it is a lengthy time investment sport just to merely play that can be played for most of your life and they end up with plenty of free time typically. In addition it has so many facets you can improve in near constantly.

They spend their whole life working and grinding monotonously on their skillset, it wires the brain in a way that it becomes part of their needs. Golf gives them an outlet with a fairly endless amount of that while providing them with time spent outdoors and the social aspects of the sport.

Not saying you need to play golf, obviously, but if you did want to retire finding a few things you genuinely enjoy, find rewarding and allow for you to sink a ton of time into learning/working on them is probably the best way forward for you. Maybe you could then work on just slowly easing off over a lengthy period. 

But at the same time, often people who work a lot are given the label of unhappy by many, yet do find satisfaction, fulfillment, enjoyment and/or happiness in working. 

If you are happy and it isn’t taking a toll on your health then why change? Of course if you are unhappy or unhealthy then professional help is probably something to really consider.",2022-06-29 14:57:18

What problems?

Men aren’t protected under Title IX, and there can be no claim of a gender pay gap is there’s only one gender in the department or workforce. If they’re an at-will state those men could be terminated with no cause, and now they don’t have to offer anyone any more money.

So long as each woman performs their job as expected, there seems to be no problem from the perspective of the management team.

I’ll say right off the bat that I’m a dirty commie so this isn’t a GOOD answer from my perspective, but it seems cash-money from a corporate litigation standpoint.

iz93l7,"Here's the thing bud. While you live in your little bubble outside a town of 70,000 and think wow all those people out there hate me the reality is the over whelming majority of Iowans are nicer and more accepting than the rest of the country. 

While you try and paint Iowans as racist, uncultured, bigots the reality is Iowans will judge you for you - not because you're brown, black, or LGBQT; not because you're a Muslim, a Catholic, or a Jew - but for the actions YOU take. If you work hard and treat people right Iowans notice and respect you for those actions.

Now I've thought about this quite a lot after moving to Denver for five years having grown up in Iowa the 21 years before. I couldn't figure out why the people in Colorado just felt ""different"" after returning to my Iowan roots I realized what it was. There is a commonality in living in Iowa - the winters are freaking miserable, the summers can be brutal, the landscape (between the ""coasts"") is flat and ""boring"" and covered in corn, a tornado could fly through and destroy everything you've ever owned, or a hailstorm could destroy your living for the year. 

But you know what?

 Iowans are in it TOGETHER. We know what it's like to come to the aid of our community not because it's ""politically correct"" but because it's the right thing to do, it's the neighborly thing to do. We know if we were in that person's shoes what it would feel like and we're an empathetic people seeking solutions.

So you can sit there on your high horse and talk about uncultured ""swine people"", ""farm bumpkins"", and whatever other condescending terminology you want to throw out while at the same time being a ""victim of hate"" - but I've got something to tell you. 

Iowans are honest hard-working people, who recognize the good in people, and come to the aid of those who need it.

BUT (and here's the bit where I think you misunderstood my original message) there is nothing keeping you here, no one says ""brunettedude you were born in Iowa you will live in Iowa and you will die in Iowa"". 

No one says that. 

No one.

If you don't like Iowa move out! It's that easy. YOU have control over YOUR actions. You don't need me to give you a round of applause and tell you how ""woke"" you are for standing up to the Iowan establishment, but it seems YOU need that vindication, that validation, that recognition... But that's the thing about Iowans too, we don't hand that stuff out. You earn it. 

Through respect, and honesty, and hard work. Because when the town you live in is a few thousand people - people you've never met, know you - and your actions, your reputation is all you have.

I'm sorry if you haven't felt welcome in Iowa, because that's not what Iowa is about - it's about family, community, hard-working, honest folks just trying to enjoy the freedoms we have left. 

But if the values of Iowa aren't the values that you share then you SHOULD look elsewhere; that's what is so wonderful about America is there are different people, with different thoughts, EVERYWHERE and it's YOUR FREEDOM to pursue - so while I was being a sarcastic ass when I said ""Bye Bye"", it was only partially so because what makes the American dream real is you're free to pursue that happiness in another state, and I truly hope you do find what you're seeking. 🙏",2020-09-26 12:36:35

You will come by alot of FUD articles like this one made to make people believe that the gamestock saga is over and that there was ""NO REASONING"" behind the jump in price. I hope you all see how they try to ridicule the situation when for the last 5 months, millions of redditors (no, not on wallstreetbets sub reddit...) shave been discussing the non-ending list of reasons why the price is wrong and artificially dropping by market makers counterfeiting shares.

b3lk9p,We we're building a house in the country outside of Garland and a little girl set up a lemonade stand and we were the only ones that were around. So we went and bought some lemonade and to was real! We bought all of her lemonade and told her if she was there tomorrow we would like to have some more! She was so happy but returned shortly to tell us her mom said it cost more to make it than what she made so there wouldn't be any more and was crying 😢. We got together $22 for her lemonade stand and told her that we had forgotten about overhead cost. She went home and came back soon happy. The next day a city inspector came by and shut her down before we could get a break. It's hard the start a small business even when your clients are supportive. Sad as hell. Kids have an idea of how to make some money and small town government shuts em down. So much for the entrepreneurial spirit! Kill dreams for the price of a permit!,2019-03-21 17:04:16

72o0eg,"I grew up in the 70's and 80's in the U.K. under the NHS and the service I received is literally no different to what I have received in the US and paid $thousands more for. Every time I've used an American accident and emergency department I've had to sit and wait at least a couple hours, just like the U.K. 

In regard to having long wait times for procedures, sure I had to wait to receive NON-ESSENTIAL surgery, in my personal experience the longest I had to wait for a procedure was 12 weeks. It's called triage, most important and life threatening first, then down the list. And besides, you aren't left sitting in pain until your surgery, you receive pain meds or whatever prescription you may need for again, a much cheaper cost. Americans I talk to always balk at having a sales tax of 17-20% (it was roughly 17.5% when I left the U.K.) compared to the 5-6% they pay here in MA but I always use the same example. Imagine buying a can of soda costs exactly $1. Here in MA you end up paying $1.06 and getting nothing (except MassHealth which really only guarantees the hospital cannot legally stop you racking up a huge bill). Compare that to paying $1.20 and getting free-at-point-of-use and fully inclusive healthcare. You buy a $1000 television but instead of paying $1050, you end up paying $1200. Sounds bad but guess what, you aren't paying $hundreds for health insurance every month, you can afford it. The cost is spread so you genuinely don't notice you're paying it and then when you need healthcare, it's there. No stress. No worry. No bankruptcy. No families losing their homes. Imagine how cheap medicine would be when buying a state level. Hospitals would no longer be at the mercy of price hiking. Doctors would no longer be given bonuses and freebies to prescribe addictive substances. The prescription pill epidemic would be severely affected in the positive, the U.K. has it's drugs, but I don't ever remember being offered prescription pills. 

Basically to any American's reading this who have doubts about socialized healthcare, I swear to you, at its worst it is a thousand times better than what you have now :)

Remember the story of the man on top of his house in flood waters. He prays to the Lord for help.

People in a boat show up, but the man refuses help saying the Lord will save him. A rescue boat shows up as the water rises, again the man refuses help saying the Lord will save him. A helicopter shows up but again the man refuses.

Finally the flood waters rise over the house sweeping the man away. He laments to the Lord ""Why didn't you save me?""

You know, a poster is easily rolled up and hidden away. A bunch of framed, 24""x36"" or 48""x72"" posters may not be so easily stored. Oddly enough, I don't think I see any sort of regulation stating what is considered the maximum *size* of a ""poster"", either. 🤔

vxaqfc,"My old company was full of people like that, infact some of them regarded it as an art form to look extremely busy while actually doing fuck all.

There was ‘paper-shuffler’ walk past his office and he springs into action furiously shuffling piles of work on his desk.

‘Paper-walker guy’ who literally spent all day walking around the building holding the same sheets of A4 paper, speeding up past occupied offices and always looking like he was in a hurry to get those sheets somewhere, anywhere but their desk.

‘Copier guy’ that one who always seems to be riding the office copier, aimlessly making duplicates, chats to everyone and lets others ‘jump in’ as they’re going to be a while, all fucking day actually especially if the site has multiple copiers they can decamp to.

‘Kitchen guy’ the one who hogs the kitchen waiting for that kettle to boil. Chats to everyone, gets everyone chatting before announcing he’s got to slip to the loo. More often seen on Mondays after a heavy weekend.

‘Monitor guy’ that one who has to recreate ‘Swordfish’ and have a wall of monitors because he’s so damn busy and efficient, yet spends his days playing minesweeper on his $20k office workstation.

‘Phone guy’ who spends his entire day anywhere but his office engaged in furious deal-making. Usually parks up in an office corridor so he can stride up and down impressing everyone with his linguistic skillz while actually talking to himself.

‘Office shagga ’ who alternates his day between preening in the toilet and chatting up the new gullible secretaries with his ‘important manger’ routine and if he scores a lunchtime quickie in a bar car Park it’s a good day.

‘The lumberjack’ a mysterious employee who manages to spend their entire time in the toilet on their phone alternating between rabid masterbating and leaving redwood sized turds and a smell that will overcome the unwary in seconds.
The lumberjack is suspected to be any of the big, fat guys, but is probably the phone guy breaking up his routine.

‘The bitch’ mumsy to your face, full of all the office gossip she’s willing to share, while trying to extract some dirt to use on you in turn. If she comes up dry, then she simply makes something up as she’s a pro and never gets caught. 

Usually a heavy drinker and past her prime, she has been known to prey on new photo-copier boys who she deflowers with relish. During desperate seasons has been known to secretly hook up with the office shagga.

This shit sickens me to my core. It fills me with such shame, rage, and disgust. I love this state's natural beauty, but these people do everything that they can to hold on to the worst parts of the legislature and history. You'd think they would have the bare minimum of human decency, but no.. They are the reason people think everyone from this state is an inbred hick.",2023-03-11 07:56:31
